Nice food, although my steak was a bit too dry.\nService, however, was terrible. Side dishes came after we finished the mains. Waiting for the waiter / bill / credit cards took 10+ mins with every iteration. The waiters were nice but not very proficient. Overall poor experience.","RestaurantName":"Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay","RestaurantNameNormalized":"Bread Street Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay","PriceLevel":[3],"RestaurantRating":4.1,"LatLng":"1.2825579,103.8575503","Delivery":[true],"Dine-in":[true],"BusinessStatus":["OPERATIONAL"],"FormattedAddress":"10 Bayfront Ave, L1 - 81, Singapore 018956","PlaceId":"ChIJC3BflwUZ2jERgMDIKbg-Aso","ReviewCount":[3895],"Types":["restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment"],"Label":"NEGATIVE","id":"ae239c93-a7df-47ba-9f1c-d1b046c27876","_version_":1796309674843177000}]},"spellcheck":{"suggestions":[]}}}]
