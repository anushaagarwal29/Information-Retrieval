Just knuckle down and get shit done and you will be seen, because too many people think that remote work is a good excuse for a paid holiday.

8vfmwi,"For remote work you need to market your experience and skills, so that potential employers can easily see your ability to produce good results.

For me that means creating and maintaining open source projects on Github, and having a history of successful and visible apps and websites that I've built. Basically my digital portfolio. 

Build things, complete them, make sure they are high quality and look good. The more quality portfolio you have, the more confidence potential employers will have that you can be trusted to do the job.",sobri909,1530507869.0
8vfmwi,"I second the comments below that a good way to start as a remote worker is to build out and incredibly solid portfolio and Github account. From the eyes of the person recruiting they just want to constantly be reassured that you are the right person to deliver the work that they need so to be able to actively demonstrate the exact skills a role is looking for is very important. 

Being able to offer a spread of skills is also very important. It looks to me like your skillset is focused mainly on backend web development at the moment and I think that being able to say you have some experience with something like ReactJS on the frontend would be a big selling point to separate you from other applicants. 

I run a website called [JustRemote.co](https://JustRemote.co) which promotes remote working positions. One thing I have noticed is that the majority of companies offering remote work at the moment are start-up's and small businesses. These companies often have fewer than 20 employees and as a result are looking for people who can offer a range of skills and are able to switch roles. Effectively the more skills you can offer companies like these the more chance you have of securing a role. 

In summary I would therefore do the following: 

1. Create a strong portfolio of well written code
2. If you can, try to display your portfolio in a visually appealing way (if you're design skills aren't great then something like [squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com) might be able to help).
3. Continue to develop your skillset with the aim of eventually becoming a full stack developer as then you'll be offering most value. 
4. Ensure your applications are well written, clear and considered.
5. Try to build a network of connections with other people in development. Referrals from an actual person are incredibly powerful and so attending start up events, dev meet ups etc can be very useful. 

I think it's especially hard when you're coming fresh from University as you have less work to back you up but don't give up! It's a numbers game and you will only need a single position to establish yourself as a remote worker in the eyes of future employees. 

Another option if remote work doesn't seem to work would be to try and work for a company like [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/en-uk/). I'm not sure where in India you're from but i've worked with many Indian developers in the UK all of which came over as consultants through Cognizant. This experience would help give strong credibility to your applications and it also allows you to build up a network of people who in the future may be able to offer you work. ",supert56,1530526842.0

432edl,"One of the big advantages of jobs in the tech industry is the opportunity to work remotely from a home office. I've been working 100% remote for the last three years. There are some definite advantages, but one of the possible disadvantages is isolation. However there are a few things you can do to mitigate this:

1.) Stay in contact with your colleagues as much as possible, via instant message, video meetings, email and phone. Don't be reluctant to bounce ideas / bond socially over these mediums. Everyone else on your team needs this interaction and you'll find the bond can become greater between you and your colleagues as a result of these efforts.

2.) Get out of the house as much as possible. You can become isolated working alone if you don't take the necessary steps to get out and do activities you enjoy outside of your home office / workplace. Do the necessary things you need to with the important people in your life. Also, go work in a coffee shop one day a week - you'll have the ""buzz"" of a good coffee and people around you. 

3.) Whenever possible, set your own schedule and stick to it. Since you work at home, the lines between work and home can become blurred. Set the proper expectations with your boss, co-workers and clients. As long as you get your stuff done that's all that matters. That's part of the flexibility of being a remote worker. 

I say embrace it. It's cool your employer allows its workers to be remote, especially in the tech sector. Obviously they've put their trust in you to work from home and make the most of it!

7dak2v,"These are all good comments.  I've been remote for 13 years and it comes down to discipline, communication, and desire.

You're working from home, not at home while you work. 8-5, 9-6, whatever your hours are are your work hours.  Don't fold laundry, catch up on your favorite shows, sneak in a nap or anything else you'd do on a day off.  No one can see what you're doing so you will be judged on your output/results, and if you're sluffing off the workday it'll show.  I'm not saying you have to be chained to your desk all day and avoid doing things like checking Reddit (lol), but the bulk of your workday needs to be spent there.

As the others said, work extra hard at communicating so you're still heard.  Schedule regular 1:1s with teammates and your boss, participate in team calls, and touch base during the day with relevant IMs.  

For me, though, the most overlooked factor is managerial support.  You can have the best plan, work your hardest, and deliver quality & timely results, but if the boss or the organization doesn't fully support you being remote then nothing else matters.  Some managers just don't know how to manage employees they can't see, and some aren't willing to learn.  Thankfully this doesn't sound like your case.

45zsz3,"> Yes I will work hard and produce results as a remote worker

I say, ""I've never had a problem keeping myself motivated and on task - I don't see why it would be any different in this position"".

Also, if you have partial experience lay this one out: ""I have also worked remotely (from time to time) in my current position, besides adjusting my routine I've never found it to be an issue when I work from home.  In fact, I actually find that I can be more productive when I'm working from home since I don't have to deal with the usual office distractions""  (you have to be careful not to sound ""crazy"" or ""overzealous"" on this part - that will totally kill it).

I've also found that something like this is a really good line:

""I've found that working remotely really isn't much different than working in a company with multiple offices (i.e. geographically seperated offices).  As long as you have communication tools like phones, IM, and conference lines - working remotely is really no different than working with people in a different offices""

I find that this one is a really good sell.  Few people can personally relate to working remotely - but nearly everyone can relate to working with people in another office.  In mind opinion, it really puts things into perspective.  Sure, there are some problems that arise from working with people in other offices - but for the most part, it's really not a big deal and most people can relate to it not being a big deal.

3x82wb,"The biggest thing that comes to mind for me is when a manager is more focused on whether an employee is getting the job done rather than warming a seat at the computer in a strict 9-5 sense. I dont need to have ultimate flexibility in defining my own hours, but remote work should be more goal focused rather than on-call. In a similar spirit to being salaried compared to hourly. 

Aside from that, a manager should strive to find the right tools that allow the team to have good communication without adding too much overhead in day to day usage. A lot of managers or project managers may disagree, but the job is still about programming rather than reporting in on things. I like to work at companies that have well defined workflows concerning how to document work done. Jira tickets? Daily meetings? Documentation that may or not be used in the future.

819ss1,"> What competencies did your manager have that positively impacted your overall job satisfaction?

My current manager lets me own my work. I rarely ever get bothered by him. He'll just ask if I saw a comment related to my work in a Slack channel occasionally. This is largely because he has his own work to do in addition to management.

My previous manager was more of a micro-manager and she went looking for work even when there really wasn't much to do. The problem was that she had two reports and nothing else to do.

> What competencies did you wish your manager had that they did not?

Nothing. He's fine.

> How did you feel about your work/life balance as a teleworker? How did it compare to more traditional jobs?

Much better work/life balance. I can help my wife out with watching the kids if she has an appointment, for example. I'm done at 5pm and see my kids the entire night whereas commuting left little time in the evenings for this. If I need to work late, the family is very comfortable with it because I'm still around to talk, etc.

An issue with office work for me was mandatory socializing and just the sense that you were visible all the time. At home, you can just focus on the work a lot more and save the socializing for family and friends.

> How did your manager impact your work/life balance?

Current manager is very positive. Like I stated, he leaves me alone for the most part.

> As a remote worker, how isolated did you feel from team members or professional peers?

I'd say I'm more out of the loop in terms of how the company is doing than I am with my peers. We communicate in meetings and chat, so we're not out of touch. I also have met nearly everyone face-to-face and some employees I worked with in-office for a year.

> How did your manager help you feel connected to the organization and its goals?

He really does nothing. I speak to peers for that info. This is true of office work, too, as managers tend to just push the executive spin.

> What guidelines or expectations did your company provide for communicating effectively?

Just that my work get done. That's about it.

> What did you do on a daily or weekly basis to ensure that you were being an effective communicator?

Just stay on top of issues as they arise in our issue-tracking software or on group-chat.

> Were your accomplishments visible to your manager, team, and company?

My manager sees my work and feedback on it, so my work is very visible to the team.

Nothing relating to remote work. I work in software and many employees work from home full-time or periodically. It's nothing complicated.

194c8wj,">Answer as many calls as fast as you possibly can, if you don't adhere to our metrics then we'll discipline you and eventually fire you.


I worked in a call center for 4 years, and it really is the pace that makes it so unbearable. They literally want you working every single minute they are legally allowed to make you work. Humans just aren't designed for that pace of work--we need physical and mental breaks to recharge (and not just 15 minutes every 2 hours, my god). Slow days were okay-ish but then they'd start sending people home so there would be fewer breaks between calls.


I did emails at the same time I was taking calls, but our call system treated emails and calls the same so I'd time my email sends to put myself at the end of the call queue. I could sometimes buy up to 10-15 minutes between phone calls on slow days, and it became kind of a game to me which helped me get through my shifts.


I was lucky that only about 1 year of my time there was full time, the rest was part time while I was in college (they had a tuition benefit). I graduated into the great recession and jobs were excruciating to come by. I ended up taking a pay cut to leave the call center and go into public sector admin work.

And some people genuinely want to work, but, for various reasons, it would be much easier to do it from home. I think the people we see that are yearning for a WFH job are people who haven't yet learned that the workplace *does not care* about what's best for workers. The workplace is all about getting as much as it can from you and giving you as little as possible in return.",notreallylucy,1703785523.0

Unfortunately, with the advancements in AI, all data entry jobs are going to become more scarce, regardless of work location. It would be great if people with an average skill set could make a living wage, from home or from anywhere, but that's not the world we live in.",notreallylucy,1703783489.0

However I believe the pros of remote work are much higher in number than the cons. Employees gain flexibility, autonomy, and are likely to be happier and therefore more productive for the business.

Your logic seems like ""well if I have to suffer, so does everyone else"". This is an unhealthy mindset and I wish you help,.

18s6h7d,"I agree that ""we are allowed to want things that benefit our mental wellbeing and lifestyles"" but that in no way means we are entitled to it based on one's personal circumstances today. 

You can tell your company you are entitled to remotely work all you want, but they may not give it to you. You may look for a fully remote job, but never find one. You may want a remote job, but your job/industry isn't conducive to working remotely so you have to change careers/industries. This is why working remotely is entitled. 

Also, not everyone thrives working remotely and for some it actually causes more harm to their mental wellbeing and lifestyle, just like working in an office might cause you more harm. 

Lastly, not that it really matters, but I'm 100% remote and will never need to back into the office at my current job and from what I can see, probably never in my career.

Kinda hard to answer from the bathroom  From the moment my boss logged on in the morning everything was a crisis. The amount of micromanagement caused me to have a nervous breakdown. I took a 2 month leave of absence due to my mental health. I worked for them for 8 years - always remote, always exceeded expectations, never had a single problem until I was involuntarily transferred to a new position under a new manager who was an absolute nightmare. 
When I got laid off the end of 2021 it wound up being the best thing that ever happened to me. 
I've been at my current job 2 years and I don't take a single day for granted. I have no customer or client interaction so my boss does not care how I put in my 40 hours. If I want to work from 9 pm - 3 am it is no issue. I've never missed a deadline, my client is absolutely thrilled with the work I do and having flexibility and freedom (especially with a family) is amazing. 
I've said the change in jobs must be like what it feels like getting out of prison. 
All that said, I couldn't be on camera all day. I can't imagine the stress that has to cause feeling like someone is staring at you all day every day. I think it would be distracting, actually.

You should give the folks you hire their independence and trust them. Assume they will act like professionals. If I couldn't trust one of my employees, I would just fire them. It just doesn't work if I can't trust you.

This is as far from normal as you can get. RUN away - don't walk. Your current management/leadership has decided paying for legal spyware is simpler than creating effective KPI's to measure your productivity. More likely your manager and his peers feel this is the only way to justify their jobs. 

I'm 100% permanent WFH (I live several states away from where my org is located). We have thoroughly thought out and developed KPI's to measure employee performance. In my manager's own words (literally have this in an email which has been printed and framed above my desk) ""I expect you to meet all your KPI metrics, be available via Teams for questions from the team and/or emergencies during working hours, and be online for all scheduled meetings. Otherwise, I do not care how many hours you work, what hours you work, where you work from, or what else you do during the day.""

You sir/madam are a working professional, not a defiant teenager. If you are not being treated as such, you absolutely should immediately start looking for a new employer that WILL do so. 

In the meantime, make this as uncomfortable as possible for everyone involved outside official scheduled meetings. Go the entire day wearing a highly offensive t-shirt (or no shirt at all). LOUDLY pass gas or belch when you feel someone is watching. Have a small speaker nearby playing Gregorian Chants or Tuvan throat singing JUST loud enough to register on the microphone but not loud enough that whomever is watching can definitely say you're listening to music. Decide that your new hobby will be starting a Wu Tang Clan tribute group and (badly) recite the lyrics while you are working.

195oka0,"First, I haven't seen this in remote work from myself or anyone I know.

Second, I'll just note that there are other ways to verify people are doing their job via things like reasonable goals and reasonable timeframes to get them done.  If you don't make it in that time frame, then either it's too difficult or you're not actually working.  

Then, whether you're napping or going to the gym or graphing the migrations of birds, it doesn't matter because you're getting your work done.  That's what should be important to the company.  If your problem is you have high performers who do everything in half the time it takes the rest of your employees, you don't punish them while they watch movies on their shift.

I'll also note that people goof off during onsite work all the time, so this is a radical departure by some bonkers paranoid CEO or senior manager.

Lastly, there's also something called ""knowledge"" work which often involves thinking and not actually doing anything with the computer.  There's a great book on this called ""Thinking Fast and Slow"".  Working through a problem, how to approach something, or being stuck with a political situation often doesn't mean actually touching the computer.

18vnc4c,"I work for a large Fortune 500 company, and I can see the way my company implemented it soon becoming the standard for IT departments at non-tech companies.

We require all new hires for entry or just out of college positions to come into the office on a hybrid schedule (2 in, 3 wfh). This allows for the higher level of supervision and mentoring needed for people with a smaller amount of experience.

For more senior positions, there is no limit to where they can live, and is full wfh unless their primary residence is in a 60 mile radius from the office, in which case hybrid is expected. We have senior people who live all across the country, and the company pays us to come to the office for 3 days once every 3 months for PI planning.

Leadership positions (Director and up) can live anywhere, but are expected to fly into the office much more frequently.

18vnc4c,"WFH will probably grow once the economy/interest rates improve, and when demand for talent meets or exceeds supply. Right now, the market heavily favors employers, especially large corporations, since there are tons of qualified people who were laid off and are now looking for any decent job they can get.

My guess is that new businesses that are founded over the next 10 years will incorporate more remote work because it will save them money on office space, and enable an expanded talent search. And once demand for talent outpaces supply, WFH will function as a perk to hire  talented employees.

I don't really buy the idea that WFH is going to mostly disappear just because bosses want to feel like they have some power over their employees in an office setting, or because ""that's how it was before 2020.""

As for why WFH is not popular?
Billionaires own tech companies and diversify their wealth (old school trick) by owning both the office buildings and the housing units, often inside of REITs. WFH means empty apartments means lower rents means lower ROI which also means lower resale value. Empty office buildings means building values being slowly eroded on that front too, as growth stalls. Further, businesses around the building are owned by multi-millionaires and billionaires, such as chain restaurants and preschools/daycares. Their profits drop as well.

Finally, as WFH allows less car use, car values stabilize when other factors like recession and winter kick in, and no one wants to spend on vroom.

So, WFH rights will be something workers will need to demand.",Select_File_Delete,1704131230.0

- Hybrid seems to be stabilizing at 3 in, 2 wfh
- fully remote is staying, but opportunities are more limited to timezone / geographical area around the office. 
- HR compliance with state tax / employment laws is ironclad, and not all states may be supported by a company
- companies / teams are working through how to mix remote and on-premise coworkers, either in same team or within same organization. Unlike during COVID when everyone was forced into remote there is now a big mix of how people can work, and where preferences lie.

Remote is never going to be as widespread as 2020-2021, but it probably won't stabilize for sure for a couple more years until hybrid can be fully evaluated, and full RTO at extremely large tech companies completes (succeeds or fails)

The facts don't lie. 

People are more productive at home. Employees are happier. It allows people to live in lower cost areas. Employers have a much larger pool of candidates and can negotiate lower salaries as a result. Startups with a remote workforce can perform better than businesses with an on-site model.

While employers are hoping to force the issue, it simply won't work -- unless they are willing to pay the difference. They will need to raise wages $9 an hour for the commute, and $14k a year for daycare. 

If employers really want to return to office, they need to reevaluate what a living wage means and adjust their salaries accordingly.

It's not an issue of employees being difficult or stubborn -- it's that many can't afford to return to office. It's not about convincing them with stupid propaganda like this.

No one with small children can afford an on-site office job and it doesn't matter how much you strong arm them. A $17 an hour job needs to pay $23 *just for childcare costs alone.* 

So when they try that shit, employees will quit because they can't afford the job. No one is going to work themselves into being homeless to stroke some executives need to have power and control.

The answer is simple -- either pay much higher wages ($15 an hour more if someone has children and commutes) or shut up about it. 

These assholes are literally expecting their employees to work some sort of miracle. Employees don't set the rental rates. Employees don't determine gas prices. The only people with the power to influence this situation are the employers.

168vbw7,"Just to throw my 2 cents about remote work and a few thoughts in general.
1. There is no unicorn entry level job. $100k, fully remote, set your own hours, travel the world, etc etc. Most entry level remote work stinks, other than being remote. Call center type work/phone work. Hard set hours/breaks scheduled etc. To get the ""easier"" or more flexible jobs, you either have to have the experience (years not months) or work in a field that allows it. Those fields usually require formal training, software/engineering etc.
2. Work ethic. Don't assume it always means selling your soul to the company/working 90 hours a week etc. Work ethic is also where people can rely on you to get your work done efficiently, correctly and reliably. Nothing makes you more valuable when no one has to remind you about something. 
3. New companies will (usually) pay more than your current job will do as a raise. Use LinkedIn and occasionally update it with work only stuff. React to posts etc. Recruiters will reach out to you. However, don't jump jobs just for jumping jobs. To get some of the perks, remote etc, you have to stay somewhere for a bit. 
4. One field people tend to avoid is sales. Whenever someone hears sales, they think car sales type dynamic. Most higher end sales roles are more account manager type. Relationship building. Product knowledge etc. Find a niche and run with it. This is what I do. Im fully remote. Covering a territory. 6+ hour drive from the office. I have as much freedom as I want but it is always driven by the numbers.",Embarrassed_Flan_869,1693775026.0

168vbw7,"I am fully remote with flexibility. 

I guess you can describe my work situation as a long-term gig worker. I have specific skills and experience - let's say I design and animate infographic videos that help communicate complex medical research information in a manner that's more understandable for a general audience.

Compensation-wise, I get contracted to work on a project for 5 months, which offers a project rate for everything I'm agreeing to complete and be accountable for. To ensure that I fulfill my commitments, my payments are split up based in milestone deliverables. So I get an advance to get started And then I essentially aim to complete work that generally gets me paid monthly.

My situation is flexible because nobody is watching my hours or when I work. I can work whenever suits me, as long as I complete deliverables according to a general timeline. If I'm able to find ways to get my work done faster and maintain quality of work, I still get paid the same.

I'm not slacking, however. I care about the work so I have internal motivation to do good work. And it's partly why I have the working relationship that provides me this remote work opportunity.

I have check ins with a team, so i accommodate for meeting times with others who work in different parts of North America. It's easy to coordinate when you have such flexibility. 

Yes. The gig projects can disappear any time, so I don't necessarily have ongoing stability, but one of these gigs pays for my living for a year, and It's been the best work/life balance I have ever experienced.",Any-Tumbleweed-9282,1693808371.0

168vbw7,"I think there are 3 viable circumstances in which companies will more readily accept remote work today.

1. STANDARDIZED JOBS WITH ACCESSIBLE PROCESSES AND PROTOCOLS: The work is repetitive, is a repeat need, or has lots of accessible rules or scripts. Such as online customer service (constant need), or retouching of event photos (ongoing production). As long as the work is delivered, remote work won't get questioned.

2. ONGOING PROOF OF SUCCESS: Experienced workers who have earned the trust for fulfilling their duties and meeting accountabilities. This works when bosses see proof of success regularly, so the remote worker always has to prove this and ensure bosses never have fear, uncertainty, or doubts about their remote working status impacting success.

3. NICHE/RARE SKILL SETS: the skills or experience they need for project fulfilment are so specialized that they need to be open to a distributed work force to access these skilled workers.

My remote work meets all those requirements. 

Some days I don't even get out of my pajamas. Some days I don't even wear pajamas LOL. I do whatever I want whenever I want and as long as I meet my deadlines, I'm good. I can go anywhere on a whim, I am literally free to choose. I was making $8k/mo at the highest, but cut back last year because I wanted to work less. It's slower now, and I like the extra time. I don't have kids, but I have 2 dogs I take care of and we do whatever we want.

Part of getting a good remote gig is focusing on what you want and realizing you can get exactly what you want. I'm in the process of leveling up in my niche, but there are people less skilled than me making as much and more than me doing the same thing with the same freedom. (Copywriting). No degree needed.

I can also work from anywhere but having to take client calls while on vacation in Europe sucked. Flexibility is a two sided thing - your employer can be flexible with your needs but they will expect the same.

168vbw7,"I wouldn't say it's rarely what you think it is. That seems to have just been your experience. I think it really just depends if people know what they're looking for. In some separate bullet points this is just my experience to highlight what it's like, using yours as a template:

&#x200B;

* Flexibility - The hours are semi flexible. I work Sunday - Thursday. If I wanted to temporarily work Friday instead of Monday, I could make the request. If I need to leave early, I could, with the exception that I work an equivalent amount of hours lost another day. I can't work as long as I want though, I'm restricted to 40 a week (which is fine). but I can take my breaks whenever. I have the choice to not take my lunch and get off work an hour early. I don't take my lunches because I don't need to but they aren't as long as I want. (You could probably cheat around this but eh, why would I. The job is fine)
* Travel - We *could* work anywhere and travel if you want to lug around a computer with you, but if you know how to use computer well and set up your own VPNs to connect to your home net, you could do this easily.
* Caring for Children - Really depends on what you're doing but the majority of employees where I work are composed of young mothers and it's allowing them to care for their kids. My sister has 2 kids and works here.
* Pay and Difficulty - It's the easiest job I've ever had. I'm not kidding here. It's almost criminal compared to the shit I had to do making $8.25 as a cashier in a shit grocery store back in 2017. On some days literally nothing happens. My partner and I both work here and we just do things around the house. One of the head managers even mentioned that they wanted the job to feel like we're stealing a paycheck. This pays $50k salary. That's not much in some high cost areas but it's good for me and for the amount of work you're doing, this essentially feels like you're getting unemployment checks. We're using this time to learn python and gain other valuable skills. However there are uptimes where things do get busy. The job can get difficult but more in a mental sense. Despite that, I can still juggle while I work. Task are done at my leisure so long as it's not past an 8 hour SLA.
* Simultaneous jobs - I could double my income if I could actually get an offer. but to be fair I haven't been sending much applications out. I'm not constantly taking calls and as I mentioned, work is at my pace So i could fit another part time or even full time job depending on the requirements. Tons of people that work here already do this. Part of me wants to maximize my earnings, the other part of me just wants a break. Between all the school, previous shit jobs and life troubles. It's nice to just worry about one job and put all my focus into learning new skills so that I could get an even more lucrative remote job or lounging about and relaxing all day. I don't care if I lose the free time. (It would definitely be missed) but its nice to have a breather AND a safety net where you can actually take the time to learn and improve myself.

I think it really depends on what someone is looking for in remote work. For some background, I work in IT. Been in this position for over 2 years. I don't have a degree in this, but Graphic Design. My experience with tech is self learned.. I have no certs, or anything, but what helped is probably the fact that I worked as a Sys Admin/Level 2 Tech the job prior but most of the skills required are entry level.. This position came to me as a random indeed email asking if I'd be interested in this position and I said yes. A recruiter called me next day, told me about it. Thought it was a scam but played along to see if the typical red flags would show but never did. Once they sent me expensive equipment and send the tax paperwork and such, I knew it was real and here I am. Remote can come in many forms, but it can be exactly what you think it is if you know what to search for and what your expectations will be.

Despite all this though I would never abuse the job. Like I wouldn't work-travel all the time, or hang out with friends while I work, etc.",KeaboUltra,1693859588.0

Due to the different variants of covid19 and their corresponding surges, each return to work has been cancelled. At this time, we know we will never return to a 5 day work week but not sure if they will attempt the hybrid model again.

That being said, if/when they do implement the hybrid model - I may start looking as well. Life is too short to hate your job. I worked remote before the pandemic so it's always been my preferred type of work. And the pandemic created SO MANY remote jobs!!! Perhaps you could give them opportunity to keep you. If you get an offer with another company, before you accept the offer you could let your current company know your plans and give them the opportunity to keep you as a fully remote person. If they can't meet that requirement, then leave and don't feel bad - you gave them a chance before leaving for greener pastures.

I've only worked remote for this company during the time I've been there because of the pandemic. Commuting sucks, I'm more productive at home and I don't like the location of the company's physical building. The office is in a dangerous part of the  city. One of the mass shootings in the news this year was very very very very very very close to the building. I can't see myself feeling comfortable working in this area until 5:00pm or later, since we regularly work 10-12 hour days from home. Quite honestly, I get much more done than when I work from home. I have fun in the office when everyone is there for sure but I am SO less productive! And not to mention - it is so much more exhausting! LOL

I go to the office on an as-needed basis, like a couple times a month. I pick my days to go in based on my work load and I leave whenever I feel like it (I dont stay a full 8 hours and will resume working once I'm home). I often run to/from my car to the front door of the office when I go in. I've already been followed to my car by a sketchy crackhead (whom proceeded to knock on my window and wave at me after I jumped in my car to get away from him) and dodged drug dealers and mentally ill people pissing on the sidewalk in front of our exit door. Yes, one day I was about to fling open the exit door and run to my car like usual and I see someones ass. A homeless drug addict had decided to back their butt up to our exit door and do their business. Literally, I had to wait for them to finish and pull up their pants before I could open the exit door, and leap over their puddle of piss before I did my normal anxiety jog/fear speedwalk to my car.

The majority of us started there and had to work that way for quite a long time in order to get to wfh.

It would be great if younger people could skip the struggles I faced in my career. But we don't live in that world yet. So far the world isn't reshaping itself for my convenience, and nobody else should be surprised when they have the same experience.",notreallylucy,1710908972.0

This is the problem. One reason I paid for a job agency, is because **EVERYONE** wants to work remote. **EVERYONE** wants an entry level remote job. **EVERYONE** wants to make decent money WFH.

Massive amount of demand, very little supply.

On the flip side, after working remote for 3 years now, remote workers have a higher turnover rate. So companies actually pay agencies to vet reps/workers for their job positions. That market is actually booming. Why? Because the agency usually trains the employees first, then places them, which means less money and time an employer needs to spend on the front end for someone. Additionally, a vetted employee/rep is 30% more likely to hit KPIs + stay with the business long term.

Edit: Forgot to mention, those companies that pay for those agencies to provide trained employees, only hire through the agency. How do I know this? I used to work for a company that provides these services to business owners. (**Elite CEOs** is the name of the business)",Ctrl-Alt-Defeat16,1710912137.0

The answer is no, its probably not the next 40 years. More importantly, these people need to recognize their limitations. If you're 3 months into your first job ever, sorry pal, you don't know anything yet. You've barely gotten your feet wet!

Full time employment requires a different tax structure, it makes you and your employer subject to labor laws that vary from state to state and country to country, etc. It was always like that.

\- Why do people talk about remote work as if it didn't exist pre-pandemic? I know several people who had remote careers before 2020 (in HR, accounting, freelance, etc) including myself for a short time (managing an e-comm site for a boutique)

\- How are people still so out of touch with what the majority actually like and dislike about office vs remote vs hybrid work?

\- I understand many roles require some level of in person work- but can we not just assess it on a case by case basis? We're at the point where we have to accept that many jobs function well or even better remotely, also that we're all individual human beings with different work styles, social needs, etc. No one wants to feel trapped somewhere, no matter how many 'fun activities' you shove in their face... it's about autonomy and practicality.

I worked as an account manager so I spent a lot of time on video calls and on the phone with demanding clients and I was able to do what I needed to do to take care of my mental well being and even though my job was awful it was palatable. 

My job now is at a non-profit and the job itself is easier, but having to be in business clothes, in traffic, in weather, in strange places, talking to strangers all day is exhausting. It takes a lot of mental preparation to be able to do this job. It's something so simple for neurotypical people and they don't even think about it but for neurodivergent people it's nearly debilitating.

* Take breaks away from my desk.
* Don't take work devices with me on a break or lunch hour.
* Go out and don't use WFH as a reason to be cooped up in the house.
* Use my former commute time to exercise, meditate, cook, clean, do laundry, 
* Wear my old tops and cardigans on camera along with comfy bottoms such as leggings, yoga pants, and slippers. 
* Track how much time I work so that I'm not overcompensating.

1aoix9n,"Hi. I've been working remotely since I graduated from HS in 2017 - First before anything create a resume that exentuates your skills, experience (Even if unpaid) as well as your goal & Objective Career wise.

Secondly find all the job search sites in which you can upload your resume and DO THAT. This will ensure while your not actively looking for work recruiters are passively still looking over hundreds of resumes including yours once you upload. Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn etc.

Next look into work from home jobs on places like Google Job search, Indeed, LinkedIn ETC. Sometimes these sites will have an option to perform a Job search for the role you're looking for in your case (Developer, programmer, programming, etc) and have an option to choose remote. Do this. 


I would suggest first looking for remote roles in your area as you may find Hybrid roles that could work (Hybrid meaning ability to work from home while also coming into the office every so often)

Often recruiters will search for resumes based on keywords. When a Keyword is searched anyone with that keyword on their resume will show up and if enough keywords show up contact will try and be established.

When I first transitioned to remote work, I treated it much like a traditional office job too - sticking to strict hours, dedicating a space for work, and trying to keep everything as 'normal' as possible. Over time, though, I realized that one of the beauties of remote work is the ability to break away from the typical office mold.  
One of the things that has really helped me is moving around the house. Some days I work from my designated office space, some days from the living room, and if the weather is nice, I might take my laptop outside. The change of scenery does wonders for my mood and productivity. Also, there are ""place cells"" in your brain that encode locations, and they fire in novel configurations when you go to new places. So if your work requires creativity, consider working from cafe shops.  


Loneliness is a real struggle, I won't deny it. But I've found ways to combat it.

15a3gha,"Your list is a good start, but from my experience, no amount of video calls or phone calls can replace face to face interactions.  Video calls are so artificial and since callers are in different environments, you don't share the same experience which play a big part in being human.

Here's my list:

1)  Work in the library or coffee shop.  I've gotten addicted to the library because I can get up and take a break and go look for some books.  You are unlikely to start talking to people unfortunately, but just being around other humans helps just a little.

2) Take a mid-day yoga class - I started yoga in 2019 and was crushed when 2020 rolled around.  Yoga is a great for combating sitting around all day, mental health, and being around other people.  

3) Volunteer - I've been volunteering for a radio station since 2018.  I've had some events happen during the work day, and I slipped out of remote work and did my volunteer work.  These events I do are super social and I find it so good for my mental health.  Most of the events happen at night or on the weekends, but I have had some during the day.

4) Find a hobby that requires you to be social.  -  I currently attended salsa classes a few times a week.  Most of them are at night, but there are some during the day.  I also do DJ classes online and have met up with some of the virtual students over the years I've been doing it.

5) Find a team sport - basketball, pickleball, tennis doubles, volleyball.  

6) Have a lunch date with your friends who also remote work - I've been bad about this.  I've only done it a few times since March 2020.  I am going to do it more now that I wrote this.  


7) Travel -  I've done a trip to Mexico and remote work and it was such a great experience living as a digital nomad for a bit.  If I did not have a GF, I would be traveling 70% of the time.

I'm currently doing this somewhat but not the full job. A web developer contact me recently and hes signed up to freelance sites like upwork and even linkedin. Now some of these platforms are very strict, so I got a spare laptop for him to remote in from my house so it shows as working from my country. I occasionally attend a quick face to face meeting with clients but he gives me notes what to say.

And Im looking to get a 2nd job as a cloud engineer. I currently work in a NOC 4days on and 4 days weekend with occasional nightshifts. THe job is hybrid 70% wfh. Switching to cloud field from networks will likely me to get a ""junior"" cloud job for at least 6 months and most likely in the office. Anyway I will see what I can get, maybe a hybrid job mon-fri with 2-3 days a week in office. So I will do both jobs.

For that Im training a guy I went to school with right now. He also learned a bit for his CCNA long ago but onyl got the now retired icnd1 (1st half of the exams learning material). So basically. But stopped and then did a bunch of odd cleaner jobs until he went to gov job centre search, said hes stressed whatever, they gave him a bunch of papers. He filled them in however he did back then and found out they deviced to class him as handicapped. So now he gets retarded financial support. The gov pays his rent and gives him a few hundred a month to buy food. For the rest of hislife except that he cannot work anymore, otherwise he looses the benefit forever if starts working. So since I know him and hes already shown some capability to work in networks field of work, and hes financially starved, he super happy to train to do my job remotely and do all the shifts I cannot do like nightshifts becuase it would comflict with my cloud job, etc. I will just pay him my exact pay for those shifts I cannot do and bank the pay of those I do.

Oh my NOC job is relaxed I have multiple hours of downtime every single shift.

For my personal routine though, I never get the dressing up part that a lot of people recommends.  I guess I seldom need to video conference (most of my meetings don't require turning on camera), so I fully enjoy not dressing up when working remote.  To me when I get to my ""work"" desk, it's work time no matter what I'm dressed in.

Also, I don't feel working from home is lonely.  On the other hand, I love the lack of immediate distractions (co-workers coming to my desk to ask for something, especially something not urgent).  Those distractions disrupt my flow and I'll need to spend time to get back to the task.  When I'm working from home, at least I can delay replying to instant messages, slack messages, email... etc.

wj7t03,"Full genome sequencing might be found to be helpful to those on thread to understand how their unique genetics might interact with remote life.

Full genome sequencing with polygenic scoring can provide deep insight into various features of one's personal psychology that would seem of critical importance when considering the loneliness etc of remote work. People are different and offering generic advice across these differences is typically not helpful. Genetics now allow us to quantify these differences.  

My full genome sequence and accompanying polygenic scores offered me an enormous amount of insight into who I am. The information that can now be reported can provide pivotally important insights into which friends, mates, jobs, communities etc. would be optimal for you. When you look around and notice how often life does not work out for people, it should not be overly surprising to you now that you understand that people have typically never had the ability to probe the polygenic genomes of themselves or their mates. Using genetics to your advantage could profoundly improve the quality of your life and that of your family and friends.

There were many important and surprising findings from my genome sequence. For example, my full genome sequence had a GWAS polygenic score for the loneliness trait. I scored at the \~10th percentile. What meaning does a 10th percentile score in loneliness have? I **never** feel alone; **never ever**. I suppose it could be said that in social interaction terms I am quite low maintenance.

{Note: I genotyped through Nebula Genetics who offer a full genome service for \~$300 with dozens and dozens of polygenic scores provided. Over the near term full genome sequencing is expected to fall to \~$100.}

I think knowing one's polygenic loneliness score among others is of vital importance. I could well imagine that those who were not at the 10th percentile but closer to the 90th percentile on the loneliness score would likely have a very different psychological response to remote living. Genetics offers the potential to help people find their comparative advantages and thrive in those environments which value such traits.",plywooder,1660006959.0

**Dress like you're going to work**

When you wake up to work, you can dress just like you're going to work. This puts you in the work mood and motivates you as well. It kind of prevents you from instantly missing your office work environment.

**Get yourself a good workspace at home**

I can't stress this enough. A good table, chair, and work environment as a remote worker is something you should always start with.

**Remote doesn't mean you should only ""work from home""**

You may miss the commute sometimes. To deal with this, you can decide to work at a co-working space near you, a coffee shop, or from a park near. Remote means you have lots of options when it comes to where you work from - and It can help you move around a bit.

There are many tips, but these are just what I think could work for you too.

15tvr8e,"Oh yes, it's a thing.

We're all wired different. Some people find the occasional to and fro the office (provided is not a crowded public transport) refreshing, a chance to relax, and a way to transition from ""Work"" to ""Home"" and vice versa.

And for some people, being at home all the time working can become damn boring pretty quickly, so the commute kind of moves them around a bit (even though they can still do their own movements that don't involve commutes when working remotely).

I've only worked in the office for 4 months since I started my career - the rest has been remote. However, if I were to go back to the office, the only thing that I would like is sitting in a car and viewing the city landscape as I move from the office to home and home to office. So in a situation like that, I would definitely miss commute.

But it's not a reason to return to the office though. I'm just saying it's a thing.

I think there was a research on it sometime. Even though this was as a result of the general lockdown, there's some things in it that can apply to some people outside lockdown.

If I didn't find any remote jobs, I would do freelancing, and never took any office job. 

Personally, I just work anyhow, always from home. If I'm ever using a different space like co-working, then I'm probably visiting a friend or family members, who may not have a good home setup for me to work.

Why not CC everyone on an email with the information before the chat or book a meeting with all parties if things need to be decided. As to a question, if it's not urgent, why not work on something else, and you definitely should have a phone number to call if it is truly time sensitive with big stakes? Maybe try and be more proactive getting info you might need if questions arise frequently?

Some of those are social aspects but some it just sounds like your work communication skills are lacking and you want a lot of guidance or struggle calling people together when it's actually needed?

wzwmgo,"Hi, I had a similar experience when I started my first remote job.

>if my boss doesn't respond to my Slack, for example, I can only wait

If you are wasting time waiting for an answer, address this with HR or your manager. If you need an answer urgently you should be enabled to call. If this is not explicit in the company culture, ask to make it explicit or at least ask for a solution.

>I still have to ""book time"" on their calendars, which are often quite full already..making me hold back from asking

Maybe what I am going to say may sound too rusty, but I want to be honest. Holding back from asking is your problem. Not your colleague's. You are not responsible for your colleague's agenda: if they can make it to the coffee, good. If not, they'll decline and propose a new date. Drop the invite, try it, you don't have to play Tetris with their agenda. Or simply ask them: when is a good moment to have a coffee? I feel isolated those days and would love to catch up. I started doing it and people are SO happy to be reached out.

>A lot of times what could be resolved faster by pulling everyone into a meeting ends up becoming several hours of 1:1s

This is very inefficient. Remote work should enable more fluidity at work. If this situation is occurring address it with your manager, you have to work together on the company culture and on async communication skills.

>Have a tough time uncovering office politics

Same here, your remote working culture has to be written and shared with everyone so whenever you have an issue or you're not sure who to talk to, you refer to that document.

Introverts like me work better at home, without having to deal with social interaction that drains me.  Extroverts probably enjoy the physical human interaction.

Some people need quiet areas to focus on their work.

Some people prefer to be faceless so that less judgement is passed.  You aren't discriminated against based on color, gender, physical appearance, size of your body, how you look and dress, etc.

WFH allows people who need to take kids to school/daycare or pick up, the ability to do so.

And if you speak to other countries, you're basically working remote.  If collaboration truly requires physical presence, then why work with India and other countries?  

And really ""collaboration"" should be in air quotes.  Boeing has no clue how to collaborate.

Honestly, the push to move things to India is really a concern for me.  My husband works for another company that set policy that you can only hire those who live in India.

My husband said that you can get 3-4 project managers in India for 1 project manager in the US.  Throwing resources (esp from another country) at things doesn't always result in fixing things.  And all that IP to another country - we obviously did not learn from China.  I would not be surprised if Boeing gutted the US workforce for other countries like India.  Boeing - who gets bailed out by taxpayers and pretty much has a monopoly on DOD (the move to Virginia is a nod to that) - should not be allowed to to hire/outsource so many jobs to other countries.  Btw: Daveyboy made a deal with India that wasn't favorable to Boeing just to increase the number of airplane orders.

Sorry for the above paragraph soap box.  It is related to WFH because we still have to communicate with other countries which will start to be more frequent.  So, no physical interaction with those not in the US.  And I feel bad for US workers who have managers in India. How the hell does that even work?  And are these people in this situation feel valued or feel like they can talk to their manager for HR type questions.",snuggas94,1708284067.0

1atcsl1,"It's post-COVID adjustment. Everything went remote during the pandemic, now many managers want to switch back and the current situation favors employers over employees. But remote work has been steadily growing for over a decade now. I also think that many companies that are going back to the office now will slowly transition back to remote work, especially in fields where skilled employees are in demand. 

I work in foreign language education and I went remote during the pandemic. Around 2022, the university I was working for wanted to switch back to in-person with hybrid for a few roles. I quit and found a fully remote job in a country with higher salaries. Last I heard, all roles that could be done remotely were switching to remote, in part because the university was hiring more and more foreign contractors that they could pay less. 

Of course, it also follows that remote work will likely mean a decrease in expected salary for employees in high-earning cities and regions, especially in countries that are open to foreign contractors.",xarsha_93,1708219008.0

 I also pointed out that time saved from commuting can be utilized more effectively (hours, seriously hours).

With that said, I submitted your premise to Chat GPT to write it. This could be your first draft and you could edit it for your voice:  


Subject: Request to Transition to Remote Work  
Hi \[Boss's First Name\],  
I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed last week, I'm planning to move to \[New State\] in the upcoming months due to some personal circumstances. While this decision wasn't made lightly, I firmly believe that my move can be turned into an opportunity for both of us, with the possibility of my role becoming fully remote. I'd like to present a few reasons why this could be advantageous for both of us:  
\- Increased Productivity: Numerous studies have shown that employees often find remote work to be more productive.  
\- Cost Savings: Reducing overhead costs for utilities, office supplies, or other associated on-site expenses can be a bonus for the company. While it's a small drop in the bucket, every bit counts!  
Retention & Morale: It's no secret that I'm truly passionate about the work we do at \[Company's Name\]. Being able to continue my role, despite the move, would not only be a tremendous morale booster for me but also ensures the company retains an experienced team member.  
I completely understand that this would be a transition not just for me but for the team as well. I'm committed to ensuring that the changeover is as smooth as possible and that there's no dip in the quality of my work or communication levels.  
If there are any reservations or concerns, please let me know. I'm open to a trial period to see how this arrangement pans out or any other suggestions you might have.  
Thank you for considering my proposal. Looking forward to discussing this further.  
Warm regards,  
\[Your Name\]",Henry_OLoughlin,1698676370.0

Yes, it depends on the company. Some will allow global remote work because their finances allow for it. Others may not, because they don't have the capacity to deal with the different taxes. If the company does not hire for the country you live in - then you simply can't work for that company.

Your post was asking how companies can post remote work but require you to be from the US correct? I was responding to that, explaining that remote doesn't usually mean globally remote. A lot of companies will state remote but they mean ""not working from our physical office building"" and not ""you can work from anywhere including internationally"" *

I saw someone else point out sponsorship for non-US citizens - this is another point I didn't mention.

1awebfx,"This is a great topic! I first wanted to point out that working remotely post-pandemic when the alternative was not being able to work at all is *completely different* from working before or after the pandemic. 

During the pandemic, I did everything online and developed cabin fever and anxiety. But before the pandemic and now, I only do my day job and freelance work online. Everything else is in person. I participate in community events, work out, attend dance class and pilates, eat brunch, and am in 2 book clubs. I also have a workstation in my home that's only for work. When I worked in person, I developed the bad habit of eating at my desk but now I eat in my kitchen and then go outside - to walk around the block or to run an errand.

To answer your question, I have coworkers who live alone. One of them loves it because she's been able to live in a gorgeous place without family or roommates for the first time. She has a large friend group outside of work and travels quite a bit. It seems like there's always a wedding, birthday party, family reunion, or baby shower on her calendar. 

Another single coworker who is an expat and doesn't have family in the UUS wanted to work in the office as much as possible. She also said she learned better in person. When she was first hired, she went into a nearby office quite a bit but then confided in me that being in the office with random people not on our team wasn't helpful. After nearly a year on the job, she admits that remote work has been better for focusing on projects but she still craves in-person experiences. 

The heart wants what it wants. If you prefer to work in person, it's fine if remote work isn't for you. There are tons of jobs that aren't remote. I would also point out that if you're the lone in-person on a mostly remote team, you won't likely get the experience you want. I'd recommend looking for roles where in-person collaboration is valued.",thesugarsoul,1708564112.0
1awebfx,"If you feel it's not right for you, don't do it. What advocates are pointing out is that some people feel _exactly how you describe_ about going into the office. It shouldn't be a one size fits all. We're not mindless automatons that are carbon copies of each other. Different people, different teams, different industries, need different things. The return to the office crap across _all_ sectors is making the decision for us, trying to coerce everyone into the same patterns again, amplifying the unhealthiness for many people, instead of having a genuine conversation about what work patterns are most efficient and productive for each person and team.

In other words: no one is saying you should _have_ to work remote. Just, we also shouldn't _have_ to work in an office either. Do what makes sense.

One thing I will ask though is about loneliness. That is absolutely a valid concern. everyone needs friends and to be social. I would ask though: why does that social interaction _have_ to be at a workplace? Could it not be that you have more time without needing to commute, etc, to attend local social events around work hours? Try to find a hobby you like then look for groups doing it. Volunteer picking up trash or for any other reason to meet folks in your community. Remote work doesn't imply or require folks have to be shut ins and never talk to people, that's silly. Socialize with your coworkers remotely via chats and casual video conferences over lunch for example, and when you need in person contact then find hobbies to meet people with the extra time you reclaim from not needing to commute and do special workplace related chores.

But of course if you still feel best about being in an office, go ahead and do it. You should be happy. You'll still find jobs that want that or prefer that. Consider branching out or learning a new skill to find those jobs. If you hate the idea of remote, then please don't do it.

At home remotely on a personal computer it's a bit iffy so I see where you're coming from. But in my line of work if you work from home you need a specific work computer at home separate to your personal one. 

My career is in government telecommunications and I worked on two federal contracts before moving to state level because it's a bit more lax.
And basically in my mind, the computers I'm on at work, are key logged and fully monitored and the screen  is recorded for QA purposes as they watch the video of your call to qa you.

When having meetings with people WFA(work from anywhere) camera is expected .

But if you're fully remote it's becoming the norm and it's extremely normal to have work computers tapped like that. 

So with all that being said the absolute best thing you can do. Is email your tech admin, ask for the minimum specifications of what they accept on a computer to work from home.  Then go buy or build yourself the cheapest possible one that meets the specifications,  to have a work only computer.

pxlklz,"I don't work for QVC but I am working customer service for another e-commerce company. My time is split between phone support and online support for incoming emails and chat support.

Do I like it? I like aspects of my job. This job has made me detest talking on the phone in my personal life. It's a tough job to be in right now because it seems like customers have overall become increasingly more impatient and rude since the pandemic began. The job takes a lot out of you and it is often quite thankless. You're going to get a lot of people that don't understand that logistics with order transit and order deliveries, and that even stocking products right now is significantly more problematic than before. People expect every company to operate with the same efficiency and speed as Amazon, with the same bandwidth. So, that can be frustrating dealing with customers who have such high expectations. Customer service/call centers seem to overall be feeling a lot of burnout right now. But honestly, the same can be said for everyone with the current climate. 

I do love my team and they're probably one of the only reasons I've stayed on this long. We keep each other sane and I'm privileged to be in their company. 

Working from home has been a huge plus for me though. Not being crammed next to people like we used to be working on location has been nice. I work in the comfort of my own home. I get to sleep in later. No commute. I save money since I'm eating my own food rather than cafeteria food or food trucks, delivery, etc. I get more time out of my day than I did previously. My cat gets to cuddle with me while I work (although she can definitely misbehave sometimes when I'm in the middle of a call with a customer lol). It's just overall a much more comfortable, natural work experience with all these WFH benefits. Idt I ever want to work on location again after WFH for almost 2 years.

4tl78b,"Just so I am not all negative Nancy alone in this thread. Here are some of the positives:

* Our group was the first experimental work from home department. (We were in a different building than the company headquarters, made sense to try it somewhere they could save a ton of money by getting rid of floor space.

Keep in mind the company I work for is a giant, slow moving behemoth. This was pretty revolutionary for them at the time.

* We had a 34% increase in raw productivity and a 19% increase in client satisfaction as well. In addition, a 26% increase in employee happiness. (Tons of more positive markers but that's a big one)

I was part of a team that asked a bunch of questions to try and figure out exactly why it was happening and here were the reasons we came up with.

* The most obvious. The employee was at home. They were happier in general because of zero commute and being able to cook/eat at home. With our health conscious people that was a big one.

* Another one was counter intuitive but makes a ton of sense when you break it down. Most assume home employees will slack more often, but it is actually the opposite. When you are only able to be judged by raw output it makes employees work harder. Without the ""show up points"" of letting a boss see you actually working it turns out you.... actually have to work.

Essentially we found ZERO negatives, and we are a collaborative work group. There are plenty of options online to telework with each other.

Another thing....  allowing your employees to work from home is the **only way** to give your employees a raise and SAVE money while doing it.

The company no longer pays for the office space and relating billing. The employee no longer commutes, essentially working less hours. The saved money on gas, metro tickets, etc... They can eat at home. 

This shit seems like a no brainer.... 

And finally my question (sorry for the long post). What do you believe is preventing companies from having more work at home positions? Like I said above, it is an obvious win-win for both parties. Why is this not happening more often?

Why isn't the government providing incentives as well? Pollution and, more tangible, traffic can both be fixed by more work at home opportunities.

You're not taking crazy pills lol. I'm in complete agreement with you based on the aforementioned studies, as well as the surveys I've taken and people I've collaborated with. I firmly believe that when people are micro-managed, they aren't able to perform their best and are less productive.

And as for the environment, that's a NO brainer! There are a LOT of studies out there showing the impacts of the daily commute. You'd think that based on this 'health conscious' generation we live in, people would be more open to this paradigm. And don't you think governments should give 'green companies' more incentives?

And yes, allowing your employees to work-from-home is an indirect raise, when you consider the amount of time & gas money that is spent commuting. Not to mention possible parking fees and toll costs (See SkipTheDrive's telecommuting calculator](http://www.skipthedrive.com/how-much-money-can-you-save-by-telecommuting/)). I tell people that once seen as a 'perk' for employees, it's now mutually beneficial for employee and employer :)

With regards to your question about what's preventing companies from having more work-from-home positions - I think the problem comes down to trust. Like you mentioned, productivity has been shown to improve when working from home. Let's face it, many of us are introverts. In addition, the workplace can be very distracting at times.

I also created a calculator that can calculate telecommuting cost-savings (not necessarily a 'service', but a tool that is pretty nifty). 

Because the jobs are pulled from Indeed (in realtime), I can not guarantee the validity for each job offer.

You can certainly run searches directly on Indeed and filter yourself as well. I simplify the process by putting the filters in place so that you don't need to search for the common work-from-home/remote/telecommuting phrases. Another thing SkipTheDrive does is searches the titles ONLY, that way the job results are more accurate. For example, if you go to Indeed and type in **telecommuting**, by default it searches the title AND description of all jobs in their database. You might get some (false positive) results returned that contain the phrase ""no telecommuting allowed"" within the description.

I'm trying to learn web development myself. I would say if it's something that is feasible and affordable for you, getting a degree would be a huge asset. Learning programming for free or independently is possible, but there's a lot of mixed opinions out there on whether people who are self taught can be/are as skilled or employable, but it's certainly doable, just probably more difficult. Other certifications may hold a little weight but a degree is pretty universally recognized as ideal.

General consensus I've heard from people is that it doesn't really matter what language you start with because you will probably need to know more than one to get a job, so pick one, stick with it until you're skilled at it, and then you can pick up others later, but people generally recommend you start with one to become adept at before you do. Since you know some C#, I suggest you keep learning that for now. Avoid hopping from language to language because one person or another recommends X as the best language to get employed.

Whether you opt to get a degree or not, but ESPECIALLY if you are going to be self taught, you should start keeping a portfolio of things you have programmed that demonstrate your ability. I've heard people say that programming on collaborative projects is also important, to demonstrate that you 1) can work on others' code and 2) can write code that is well documented/marked and clear so that others can understand and work on YOUR code.

What I am working on doing is working with people who can provide services that would increase in demand if problems in the economies got worse. Through this I'm looking to create both WFH opportunities and WFH jobs. 

It's important to differentiate between 'Opportunity' and 'job'. A job you can be paid as much as it makes sense to pay you, and an opportunity you can be paid as much as you can make.  Performance based things are opportunities (for those who suit them) and customer service etc is jobs.

You end up doing a lot of unpaid work, like marketing your services and consulting with potential buyers, and on sites like Freelancer and Fiverr you'll be competing with a lot of people willing to do the same things for a lot less. Even if you do a great job of selling your value to people willing to pay higher for better results, those kinds of people are the minority in places like that.

If you're searching for jobs yourself, don't go in blind. The ratio of scams to legitimate remote job offers is staggering. [Rat Race Rebellion](https://ratracerebellion.com) is by far my favorite work from home job listing site. They vet all of their listings in advance so you don't have to sift through the fakes yourself. If you don't see anything that fits your skills in recent posts, then check out their Big List (there's a link at the top of the page). You can type ""education"" in the search bar and see what jobs fit you. They also have a course that only costs, like, $10 and teaches you how to search for legit work from home job listings yourself and how to craft resumes that work specifically for remote employers. I definitely recommend it if you can spare the change. It helped me immensely.

To answer your last question, education and experience are weighed differently from employer to employer. I will say that most employers who have educational requirements have an added ""or equivalent in experience"", so I would say that experience is better in general.

(My expectation is that there'll be a permanent bifurcation between the companies that fully embrace WFH and go 100% online, those that will force a return to physical proximity no matter what, and those like yours that take the middle ground and leave the choice up to their employees.   What I can't predict is which of those will be most successful, or if they'll all coexist and just develop different cultures around how work happens.

- The fact that buying a car (!!) and working in an office environment would lead to an extra financial burden should not come as a surprise.

- Depending on your old salary, taking a long mental health break via FMLA (US) probably would not have cost more than the $10k + expenses. This might have been a good option if you had some savings to keep you, or access to state Paid Family Leave or short-term disability. A break like that may have given you the time and mental clarity to find a job with a better fit - either a lower-stress WFH job or an in-person/hybrid job with better pay.

No wrong or write answers here, but the consensus I see / hear/ and believe it those most interested in upward mobility, recognition, advancement, promotion and growing internal political capital, in office is pretty key. Simply put, we want to see you, know you, engage with you on a personal level (be able to look in the whites of your eyes so to speak). If that's not important to you, it's not important to us.

If you're comfortable in your career and not looking for much lift, remote is fine. You can be a big contributor, do a great job, be effective, etc. We need people like that and we want them to be happy. But the future leaders of product lines, divisions, et al need to be more present. Primarily because it's not just about you/your role, but rather how you integrate into other disciplines, leadership, etc.

It's taken me a long time to make this distinction. Not everyone strives for the next goal or role. Lots just want their check and to live their life. That's fine.

The real problem is when the former wants the latter but still want it on their terms (WFH). That doesn't work and you'll see that playing out across industries in promotions, raises, mobility, career trajectory, etc. That's why I think it's a big mistake for young people and those young in their career / position with their company to WFH.

17mhvrd,"So it's really 125k vs 182k. That said i'm guessing you didn't add in whatever 401k match you get on the current 125k. Let's go with a standard 4% (5k) and you're at 130 v 182 to compare total comp (not accounting for benefits).

I've been working from home for 10 years now and now that I have kids it's basically a necessity as I need to be able to get them on the bus in the morning and be home when they get off the bus. When they are older I would be able to do  hybrid or full in-office job.

If I were in your shoes and didn't have constraints that need WFH I would definitely take the new gig. 

A 50k increase in total compensation is a BIG deal. Add into that the compound growth of that extra $30k they will be directly contributing to you're retirement. Also don't forget to consider any future merit increases, which are % based. So the 10k higher base salary means for every 1% your salary is raised you are adding another $100 to your new salary vs the old one plus another $210 in additional 401k match. 

All of that considered if you forecast the 2 salaries out 5 or 10 years you're looking at a six-figure difference in total compensation between the 2 jobs and it gets you out of a boring job. 

Plus who knows where the future takes you. Maybe after spending some time in the new job you are able to WFH part or full time. 

I would take the new gig in a heartbeat.",beholder95,1699016407.0

And doing something interesting is worth more than what you're paid.  (As long as you're paid enough to support a decent lifestyle.)  And OP, it seems that you'll probably come out about even to start, with the cost of commuting.  And if I read your post correctly, the large 401k contribution makes the new job a better long term option.

Of course change is always hard.  And there's always a chance that a new job won't work out.

Do the math including your commute fuel costs and time, extra vehicle wear and tear (or vehicle ownership period if the job would cause you to own a car that you otherwise wouldn't), food/coffee costs at office vs. at home... I don't know your specific circumstances, but you may very well find that it's that 10k difference or even more.

How much stuff are you able to get done during work hours? 

What time do you wake up for work, how much time is spent between waking up and starting work (do you wake up at 8:30 and start at 9?) 

Are you a morning person? Do you wake up and like to have a slow morning like me - aka need an alarm to go off an hour and a half before you leave for your commute or are you like my husband, up and out the door within 20 min?

25 min one way - is this with traffic? I am about 15 min from work no traffic but with rush hour I leave 30 min before because there are a lot of delays. 

1200 is a big diff considering the retirement and health benefits, but is it worth potentially 2 extra hours of your day and no getting stuff done even it's as small as unloading the dishwasher or tossing in a load of laundry? 

Personally, not much would trump work from home for me at this point. The time and mental health benefits are just unbeatable.

141h0bh,"Boomers don't have a problem with WFH. There are many boomers who indeed WFH.

What your parents have is a problem with boundaries. But I also think that because you are visiting them they likely didn't expect you to work so much. How often do you visit and do you do it out of obligation? So many things at play here.

My parents always visited me and most of the time I had to work. They didn't have a problem with it. Typically they were out all day seeing the sites and we'd all meet up at my home and have dinner together. As they got older and could no longer travel I visited them more often but sometimes still had to work. My dad once asked why did I work so much but didn't interfere with my work. But he was worried about the number of hours I worked.

Even in hospice where my sister's and I stayed with my dad around the clock because we didn't want him to be alone, I stayed with him thru the night and I'd still work in the wee hours when he slept. But I was still bedside.

But these days I wish I had not. My company merged with another and I lost my job. My job loss was not because of performance but because I said no to being taken advantage of and saying no to an approach the client wanted but I could not defend. My hard work, good client relationships and loyalty was not reviewed. I was kicked out and another person was given my projects to manage.

Learned then that loyalty is not rewarded especially when circumstances change. 

Perhaps if you can let them know that while you're visiting you need a block of time free to work. If it's your vacation but you're still working then that's on you. If you own your own business then that's a totally different ball game and you may need to work if you left someone in charge and they need an assist while you're away.

141h0bh,"Your initial question is very disrespectful to the generation that brought you the tools for WFH. Cell phones, personal computers, the Internet, the Web, HVAC-R in economic reach of almost everyone. We had a meeting and you're out. Turn in everything we invented. 

Respect for the workplace is independent of age. Lots of Gen X and Gen Z don't get it, including people who are supposed to be working from home. Thus the market for things like mouse jigglers (isn't that something for your generation to be proud of?) and the ongoing discussions of long naps, workouts, and abbreviated work days. 

You don't live with your parents. You visited and planned one work day. It was a failure. Now you know. Don't plan that way anymore. You're unlikely to change them and that isn't because of their age but who they are. I'm unlikely to change your ageism. It isn't worth getting energized over. 

My wife and I WFH. I've been doing it for 15 years. My wife nearly 30 years. We knock gently on each others doors. We use texts, IM, and email to avoid interrupting each other. Notes. When we encounter one another around the house we start with ""do you have a minute?"" My FIL approaching 90 gets it when he visits. My nieces on the other hand do not. They want their privacy but don't value that of others. Shall we talk about entitled young people?

Before WFH, a long time ago, I did freelance on the side. While visiting my parents, I was still handling some back-and-forth requests for a client.

He came in my room frequently throughout that whole morning, agitated that we were not going to have time enough to get our work done. I had to stand up and walk him out the door and shut it. And guess what? When I was done, my dad's task took all of an hour.

I also have friends from out of state who recently moved closer and have been inviting me to visit. I did, twice, for just a weekend, taking off a Friday on one of them for a long weekend, and they asked ""oh, why don't you come and stay for a week? You can work while you're here."" And I'm like ""nah."" Besides needing concentration, I also work on a large second monitor with peripherals. I do layout and graphics work, and depending on the workflow step, working on a tiny laptop with a trackpad is just out of the question. They still don't seem to understand. 

And yet another set of people, an older boomer couple that is relatives of a friend of mine, I heard commenting on some of my freelance work while I was in the other room.

All companies have HR, and remote first companies seem to often invest in L&D and employee experience tools that might even make for more robust HR departments.

I check EE and HRBP as well as HR Analyst and other HR roles as well as L&D. Stuff is out there. However, a lot more are fairly senior or want robust skill sets, so it may depend where you are in your career, but that's a factor of the competition in the market. 

But the ""around you"" part is confusing--actually remote jobs shouldn't be areas dependent. My area isn't the greatest but that's part of why remote work is awesome. 

If you're early career, many jobs suck (HR particularly is one of those fields where entry level jobs are harder and more thankless) so being WFH and not liking your job is definitely better than in office! Build experience so you're more competitive to move on, if needed and that's the case. 

If not, fix up that resume and always be looking. I liked my job, but just got a new one because I apply to interesting things periodically and a great opportunity arose. If I'm not moving up constantly, I'm moving on. And even if I am, I'm keeping my job hunting going to stay sharp, since it's so easy to do so with remote work. ",berrieh,1710651285.0

I've never been a social butterfly at work. I go there to earn a paycheck and all the drama of mixing with work folks socially is just next level awful.  So that's not what drives my opinion.

I think being a veteran WFH person, the pandemic added a whole other level of isolation that just wasn't felt pre-pandemic.  Kids were having to do school at home. Other family members were out of work or also WFH and, being new to the dynamic, were awful to be around constantly.  No one was going out for dates or dinners with friends. Everyone was piled on top of one another for hours and days and months on end.  It was chaos!

I'm also guessing you spend about eight hours at the office. But at least an hour or two of that time is probably kind of wasted time. Let's say that generously you work six hours after taking some time off for lunch, and other time wasters that are part of being at the office.

So you are away from home for almost 48 hours. But you really only have to do 30 hours of actual work.

In the work from home position, the commute is off the table. And those times when time is being wasted? That's when you can be throwing in a load of laundry. Or making a sandwich for lunch. Or unloading the dishwasher while listening to somebody babble on during a meeting.

You put in your 30 hours of actual work, and the rest of your time as yours.

Which one sounds better to you? 30 hours of work for $2000 a week? Or 48 hours of work for $2250 a week?  Oh, and gas plus vehicle maintenance and where in tear Hass to cost you $100 a week or more, unless you were driving an electric vehicle or a really efficient hybrid.

That's not including the hour of my time spent on the commute. That's roughly $7000/yr loss and rising, thanks to inflation, just to go into the office. Double that if i want to consider the cost of commute time. Without any consideration of how awesome WFH is compared to office life RTO costs more than $14k a year for me",KenJyi30,1687929212.0

For your current position, if you add in the commute time, you get around 2426 hours. That makes your hourly rate $48.64. Also, note how much you could get done with an extra 300+ hours in your year!

If you break it down by hours of your time (I would), you'd really be getting paid more at the new job, not even including car expenses. As long as you can swing it financially, I think it's 100% worth it",mittsandgiggles,1687929300.0

14kv8lj,"If you factor your commute time into your current hourly pay (I'm assuming you work 40 hours a week at both jobs), you would make approximately 1 dollar less per hour at the new job. (you spend approx. 208 hours a year commuting, so 118000/2288 vs 105000/2080)

I'm going to guess based on your numbers, your commute is probably somewhere in the range of 15-20 miles? That's 4500-6000 miles a year, so that means one extra oil change every year. Plus gas, that's at least a gallon a day in most vehicles, which would be 156 gallons of gas, at the current national average that's almost $600/year, or upwards of $1200+ if you drive something not very fuel efficient and live somewhere where gas is significantly more than $3.61 a gallon. It's also 1 more set of tires every 10 years, and your brakes will need to be done one more time every 5-10 years. (This is to say that in a decade, you will buy one less set of tires and have your brakes done 1 or 2 less times without your commute than with it) - plus all the other incidentals on the car.

You might be able to get your insurance lowered if you demonstrate that you're driving a lot less, too.

* You save the aggravation of the commute, and get back an hour of your time *each day*.
* You save the time in the morning you spend to get dressed and ready for work.
* You save money on gas and vehicle maintenance. Your car will last much longer.
* You save money on dress clothes. (I wear comfortable shorts and a polo all day.)
* You can get small chores done around the house in between calls, instead of spending your free time doing chores all day.
* You can eat healthier, and don't need to spend money going out to lunch.
* You can exercise in between calls. I often take meetings on a treadmill, or do a dumbbell workout on a call where I just have to listen.

- About $50/week in food (* 48 weeks = 2400)
- About 20,000 miles (555 gallons of fuel in my car), so $1800 at 3.25 a gallon
- Wild guess $500 in maintenance (brakes and tires mostly)
- I've kept my paid off car 2 years longer than expected, so call it $2K a year accounting for payments and residual value.
- $400? In clothes and shoes. I have no idea- I'm married so clothes just show up and I don't know what they cost
- $500ish on takeout dinners I would have bought because I was getting home late

So $7600 roughly. That comes out of my take home pay so probably $9K in salary to make that. 

So in your case I'd be down $4K salary but I'd get back about 450 hours a year (driving and ironing clothes) at a cost to me of $8.88 per hour salary or 7.10 an hour after taxes. More if you consider whatever I'd make if I invested that money.

If you work full time, 2080 hours a year, 260 days a year, and your commute is 80 minutes daily, 3x a week, then you're spending just under 208 hours a year commuting.

$56.73 x 208 = $11,799.84

The $13k pay cut is entirely reflected in you not needing to drive to work anymore (you don't keep the full $13k due to income taxes).

Factor in the savings from less annual vehicle maintenance, less gas for car, lower insurance premium due to no more work commute (they factor your commute in, tell them you're work from home driving 0 miles on average. You might need to shop around to see who has the best policies for people that don't commute to work), you can save money making food at home instead of buying lunch at work if that's what you used to do.

14kv8lj,"So, the expected pay bump for switching jobs should be about 15-20%. That's not always accurate, but that's the average. So if you are taking a lower salary for this remote job, let's calculate the opportunity cost. 

&#x200B;

Current salary: $118k

Expected job switch salary: $135k

Remote salary offer: $105k 

&#x200B;

So your real loss here isn't $13k, it's roughly $30k. Maybe a little bit less since you just switched jobs 1 year ago. 

Let's give the new job the benefit of the doubt on the benefits. 401k match is usually up to about 3 or 4%, so let's say that's worth $4k. Let's say that a more generous bonus rounds that up to $10k. 

Then let's add 1:30 of commute 3 days a week. That's easily $1k of gas a year. That's also about $8-10k worth of time (based on what your salary shows your time as worth). Depending on your field, you might literally be able to take the 5ish hours a week you would be commuting and turn that into freelance money. 

&#x200B;

Based on the above I would essentially have the following values:

&#x200B;

Current salary: $118k

Remote offer + benefits: $124k

&#x200B;

With all that said, there are two more questions. 

&#x200B;

1. Are there other jobs out there? If this is a common role I would keep looking tons of jobs are remote now. You shouldn't have to take a pay cut for remote work anymore. Personally, I think you can find a remote job that pay more than your current job if you look enough.

Obviously you will likely have to invest some money on a home office setting but I still think it's much cheaper to be at home. That might be tax deductible too.

The company culture and attitude has to change to put remote works first, rather than as an add-on. The company I work for (massive govt consulting company) originally wasn't a WFH company. We're diverse and spread out (office everywhere) that remote was possible, but at the time it was an add-on. The preference was thast you work out of what ever nearest office there was to your location.  We did have some people remote, and even some of our sub-contractors were remote, but at the end of the day we were a in-office company. Then COVID happened... the writing was on the wall, and so it was announced that were were going to try one day to have everyone work from home to test the infrastructure.  It got scheduled for a Friday .... Thursday we packed up, took what we needed home .... and that's the last time we were officially in the office. Over the weekend, things shut down. The offices opened up one day so we could retrieve any items left behind, and then that was it. Eventually there was talk about RTO and what that would mean post-COVID. It was pretty much guaranteed to be a hybrid situation, it was a matter of what the combination would be .... then two things happened.... 1) the numbers started coming in. People were happier. Productivity shot up over 30% in the first six months... and stayed there. The reasons why were obvious - people weren't spending two hours commuting to work, getting all pissy and being grumpy. Needless interruptions topped. 2) The kicker though was the CEO woke up one morning and thought to himself that he really didn't feel like working in the office any more. That was the turning point. RTO talk stopped, and the directive came down ""make this work"" ... My team is spread out all over the place. SC, NY, Va, TN, UT, CO ...hell there's one guy on another team who doesn't have a perm address anymore, just a PO box somewhere... he's leading the nomadic life. Last I heard he was in Idaho.

But I have to use time for anything that comes up. Whether in the office or WFH.  These jobs are very metrics based. Many of the jobs in my company are phone center based so it's pretty strict.

Core hours of--for example--10a to 2p means you can work 5.30a to 2p and count on being able to work with someone who works 10a to 6.30p. It means someone working remotely up to three time zones away doesn't have a completely weird schedule. That's flexibility.

You said 1.5 hours with your daughter is not enough. So I arbitrarily picked 4 hours and took the extra 2.5 hours per day out of your work day. That means a work week of 27.5 hours. That is a part-time job, salaried or not. If you ""can get all your work done"" in that time then you already have a part-time job and you are over compensated. You should already be asking for more work.

WFH is not subsidized childcare.

The standard American full-time work week is 40 hours. If you are not consistently averaging 40 hours you aren't doing a good job, or you don't have enough to do then you should be asking for more (which leads to raises and promotions), or something else is fundamentally wrong and should be addressed.

When people apply all the applications get sent to the agency where I work and I process the cases and make decisions. Before Covid we were told we can't work remotely.

And when I print stuff out that needs to be mailed it prints to the mail room and there is a machine that folds and stuffs all the envelopes so my office assistant doesn't have to mail anything either and they were allowed to do remote work either. 

Then after Covid they finally found a way to make wfh possible. And we wfh for 2 years. My boss told me I've been much more productive at home and so have a lot of other people. Then they wanted us to RTO. A lot of people quit. Others quit later once they lined up a job. They had a hard time hiring because no one was applying since people are looking for wfh. And a new hire is considered a trainee for a year and it really takes 2-3 years to become proficient. Those who are hired never last a year. Since we are so understaffed all examiners are getting more cases/work and they have a hard time with the caseload since they are new. 

So reluctantly they started added wfh days. They had to keep increasing it and now I only have to go in once a month! It is performance based though. I only know of a few others that only have to go in once a month. So a lot of the other examiners are upset they have to come in 2-5 days a week.

165eyyz,"Okay I love this for you and anyone else that has this WTH experience! :)   
I've never worked from home, although currently looking to, and I KNOW I'll be better off. Especially mentally. The getting ready, commuting, dealing with people in and outside of work, communicating endlessly, masking all day and every work day, to go home to deal with more adulting tasks, made me sick and tired of being sick and tired of life. I'm extremely anxious to have to go back to work (if the work isn't remote). I'll deal with it and adapt because that's what I do, but will I be mentally unstable from it? Most likely. Probably. Yep.   


Work-life balance was never really a thing. I'd be too physically and mentally exhausted to do stuff on days off. And these were part time jobs (due to a few circumstances). I don't think I would have survived if it were full time. And some of the jobs were literally for experience I was trying to gain. The pay wasn't great and if I didn't have food from home prepped (another stress), then most my 'wages' went on lunch. And let's not talk about travel expenses. I felt like I was working for nothing. But I was willing because I needed the experience (whatever that ended up being).

165eyyz,"I feel you! My last non-WFH job was running a rehab in Florida. I worked 72 hours a week (salaried so no OT), and overnights. So I got Saturday night off to myself but I just stayed up all night because I'd have to be at work again Sunday night. Bless my now wife for dealing with it for almost 2 years. I first met her during that schedule and it made everything difficult. Date nights, traveling. Anything at all because it was really just one free day a week. 

Now.. I have free time for everything. WFH positions can definitely vary. Although my first WFH was more strict I could still do some tasks on my lunch break. At the very least I could still do a couple of loads of laundry. 

With this one I am 100% in control of my time. Sure, I'm supposed to be available for phones, but I can just change my status to away and be gone for 20 minutes and no one says anything. Since it's a sales job, my results reflect in my efforts. So I work hard and sell well.. but also am very lax. I almost never have adult/home chores after work. Mostly because I wake up a couple hours before I start at 9 and don't have to dedicate that time to a commute/getting ready/packing food. But I can do laundry throughout the day, mow on my lunch break if needed, run to the dump up the street for trash. Even schedule early morning appointments. You wouldn't think the difference between 8am and 9am would be so drastic but it is. 

I also work til 5. With an hour lunch break. So technically I only work 35 hours a week. My boss has a weekly goal/incentive for us that if we sell 5k or more in a week's period, we get a half day of our choosing. I almost always hit my goal, so on those weeks I'm only working 32 hours. 

The caveat is that the pay is only meh. I have a 32k base salary, and the commission structure is pretty shit so even though I'm top ten in my territory I might only make an extra 8k a year. 

Unfortunately.. that means I need more money. So I'm going back to school for accounting with the hopes that it'll be a good salary and eventually be working from home again even though I know I won't be in the beginning. But honestly WFH is the best thing for me. It's been great for my wife and I, and I hope it gains more popularity down the road as the greybeards and boomers retire.",BlackAsphaltRider,1693422427.0

Make friends at work so you have people to reach out to. Something else I've learned is PLEASE don't be afraid to ask as many questions as possible. Working from home is an art and you paint it however it best fits you. Just try not to fall into unhealthy habits or things that can cause you to be unproductive/unmotivated. If you're a coffee/tea drinker, have that comfort cup handy. Separate your work from your personal as much as possible. I spent six months with my monitors in my room and went mad.

That's why they hide in meetings all day and syncs, status updates, planning sessions, focus groups, etc.  You don't actually need that BS to manage people effectively and good front-line management isn't a full time job.

OP refers to them as menial my hunch is they are tasks they don't like doing but are critical for the role.  The manager asked for this to observe them to try to figure out what the issue is and how to best resolve.  Are they unclear on the ask or on the process?  If not then are they intentionally just not doing the work?  Asking someone to come in 1 day a week while training, especially when the manager is apparently giving them flexibility and not even requiring them to be there for 8 hours during the day isn't harassment.  It's a manager trying to work with an underperforming new hire.

I was curious so I looked at their post history.  They've been given feedback about their performance that they've dismissed, and they took a pay cut to leave their last fully remote job for this one.   You only do that when the writing is on the wall that you're about to be out of a job.

167cf9k,"God I hate this whole attitude I see on here about ""you're going to ruin WFH for all of us!""

Managers and companies that want to be remote will stay remote and see underperforming employees as such.

Managers and companies that think in-person work is more effective, or just want asses in chairs will demand that, regardless of how efficient employees are, either remote or in-person.

I have been working at remote or partially-remote companies for 8 years. I've never once witnessed underperformance blamed on someone being remote. Remote companies don't care that someone might be underperforming because they want/need people who can work well remotely. So, an under-performer is seen as just that, and they get let go. They are not a good fit.

Even at mostly in-office companies I've worked at that allow flex remote work,  if someone is underperforming when they are remote -- clearly slacking off and less available, they are simply let go for it.

On the other hand, managers who believe in-person work is more effective are always going to feel that way in my experience. Doesn't matter how well you do with remote work. Usually it's the manager who doesn't work with a remote-first model, so they will sabotage remote workers by refusing to utilize digital tools.

Edit: I looked at OP's post history and something is weird. 

They created a post 4 months ago discussing the same exact scenario, except in the last one, the boss was male and OP's commute was 3.5 hours instead of just 3. Also, somewhere they say they are a Software Engineer, but in the last role they were a Business Analyst. I know there can be crossover in these roles, it just seems a bit odd that four months ago they were also ""new"" to a role where a different boss was having them drive 3.5 hours into the office for training.",C_bells,1693665506.0

In my experience they give me a WFH budget ($200 to $1,500) to buy stuff. The catch is, you have to purchase it with your own money but the company reimbursed you. Another downside, the money they give you during reimbursement is taxable. So you technically aren't 100% reimbursed.

At my last job, we had to install something called Citrix, which simply lets you access the remote work computer associated with your employment. It's literally the same computer if I walked into the office and sat down. Typically, work desktops aren't actual physical machines, but rather a cloud instance. The machines you see in office are simply just hooked up to receive and emulate the cloud instance. It's why you're able to go to the office and sit at ANY cubicle desk, sign in, and literally get the same emulation of your assigned work computer. Same thing happens at home when you use a client called Citrix (or whatever you're assigned to use).

1ajpcwp,"> So you also have a separate dedicated internet service just for work? By your logic you should. 

Yes, actually. It's not my logic, it's the law in the US to one extent or another.

Federally, mandatory equipment/resources, including a portion of your internet or any mandatory mobile connection, can't reduce your effective pay below minimum wage for that given week.

> So you go to the office and work on the provided desktop there.

Yes, the federal rule does only apply if WFH is the nature of the job or mandatory in some other fashion. If it's voluntary, you can just go into the office.

In many states, they have specific guidelines for remote work equipment and reimbursement that supercede the federal minimum requirements.

Our place is just outside of a town of 3000 people, and it's fantastic. The people are nice and laid back, scenery is beautiful,  We're learning to cross country ski and kayak. Our kid is in all kinds of activities her last school didn't have.

14nbc9n,"/u/GPTCT What I do not understand, and would like your perspective on, is what is so contentious about WFH anyways? 

Clearly, many people want WFH. The reason many people want it is because:
1. The time saved that was previously wasted commuting.
2. People can use their lunch hour to both make and eat their lunch, rather than having to spend time the evening before making lunch. They have more free time in the evening for themselves.
3. It is cheaper. Some companies, like mine, want me to come into the office but expect me to pay for parking. Previous companies I have worked at at least paid for parking. Not to mention cost of gas and vehicle maintenance.
4. A lot of jobs, you can do the exact same thing at home, but with significantly less distraction. No more wasting time talking to Bob while making coffee. My boss recently got mad at me because I was working from home (hybrid role) and refused to go into the office to sit on an office computer in a zoom meeting. Apparently me being in the same zoom meeting from my house was ""less productive"".
5. Studies continually show working from home is more productive. Certainly, in my job, that is definitely the case. My job requires calling people all over the world a lot, so being in an office hearing 40+ people yammering away on their phones to clients is stupid, because I have clients tell me they cannot hear me over the background noise and I have to step away to talk to them. 
6. Not only are workers more productive when they WFH (I understand certain jobs like construction, WFH is obviously impossible), but it has the potential to reduce overhead costs significantly. Workers also clearly value quite highly WFH, which companies could then offer as a perk to attract top talent, and, as my cynical self would expect, take advantage of WFH to offer workers lower wages in exchange. Companies follow the money at the expense of everything else, so why they aren't embracing WFH is beyond me. Companies that are smart are offering WFH and poaching top talent from companies that refuse to adapt. WFH is here to stay, so companies need to embrace it or they will eventually go the way of the dinosaur.

I also think WFH is getting pushback from middle management boomers that have an antiquated idea that butts in seats = productivity. Not to mention, most of middle management is a complete waste of space anyway. Their underlings work harder than them and middle management makes an important decision once in a while. I think middle management is scared that WFH will shine the light on what little they do.",timetavern,1688222018.0
14nbc9n,"I'll do my best to answer your specific questions, but I will start with my personal view on WFH and why it's so contentious;

First off, I think WFH is great for may jobs and many employees. I fully support it and have been vocal in my executive leadership team meetings as well as board meetings. Unfortunately it's much more nuanced than many people want to believe. There are many people no matter the job that can not work from home. They do not have the skill or discipline. These are the same people who cause massive issues when they are not allowed to WFH. 

Second, it has never been contentious until Covid, but now it has become contentious due to the forced WFH and employees wanting it to continue no matter what. Very few in Sr. Leadership want to force ultra productive WFH employees to RTO, the problem is with the new employees or the ones who aren't working hard. It is very difficult to pull them back into the office and single them out, so many companies just say RTO or hybrid for everyone. Obviously there are a lot of specific nuances to this, but this is the main issue. 

I'll answer each point and will expand if you would like to continue the conversation.

1) I agree that the time saved commuting is great and can make good workers even more productive. The problem is that many workers aren't disciplined workers who want to do what's best for the company. As seen in this sub, as well as many others. Many people HATE working and believe that they are being exploited by greed monsters. They will do anything they can to screw the company. 

2) I completely agree with this assessment. Again, great workers with drive and integrity aren't the issue. They are being harmed by the bad workers who want WFH to basically get a paycheck for doing as little as possible (if you read this sub much, at least 1/3 of the posts are people who post about only working 2 hours a day. The vast majority of the comments are people telling them to ""do it as little as possible for as long as you can"" ""never work harder than you are asked"" etc etc. Another popular post is young people asking about WFH jobs because of how ""Amazing"" it sounds"")

3) Did your company pay for parking pre Covid? If not, this point is moot and actually hurts the WFH case. Like many other staunch WFH points, these ""pay for my commute"" points cause decision makers to become increasingly frustrated and less likely to accept any arguments. We are all human beings, there are many stupid points for RTO that make you pissed off and hate the people saying it. This is one of those points but on the other side. 

4) Yes, many jobs can be done at home. Many also need to be in the office at least some of the time. All jobs are different and many benefit significantly from being able to randomly and quickly walk over to your coworker or boss and to get help or collaborate. (Yes the word collaboration is used a lot for RTO and it sends people into a tailspin. I'm not using that as a talking point to say that's why everyone needs to RTO. Collaboration is a real thing and to simply claim it does not exist is also BS. It's the opposite side of the same coin) 

5) Many studies are actually showing the opposite. Unfortunately anyone can find a study ""proving"" their point. If you were sent 10 studies showing how RTO is more productive, you will pick it apart and not accept it. The same can be done from the other side. There are way too many variables to make the issue black and white. Every study will depend on the inputs, and unless the study was from your specific department in your specific company, it's pointless. 

6) Again, it's not black and white. The vast majority of jobs aren't monkey work where there is a task that needs to be done by one person and once it's done they grab another one. Business is dynamic, if companies find that they will save significant money and have a happier and more productive workforce, that's what they will do. You(and many others) WANT to believe that because you are more productive in A WFH environment, everyone is. 

7) This type of thinking is so simplistic and childish that it's hard to even reply to. Are there incompetent assholes in middle management? Yes, no question. Are there incompetent assholes in all levels of organizations? Yes, and this is a large part of the reason that companies are going RTO. The concept that WFH is better for everyone involved, it saves money and creates a much more highly productive workforce, BUT some people in middle management roles believe ""butts in the seats equates productivity"", so companies will sacrifice much higher profits to capitulate to these middle managers? Please think about this from a rational perspective; No business owners, Boards of directors or Executive managers will sacrifice the long term health and profitability of their company because of a middle managers neurosis. They are middle managers for a reason. They don't make decisions for the company. It's this type of rational from the employees that irritates Sr. managment to the point of just going RTO.",GPTCT,1688225474.0

You mention that some people slack off when working from home, but from what I have seen, these same people will just pretend to work most of the time if in the office. So what difference does it make? These are people that need to be flushed out anyway, and i would say it is necessarily a problem related to WFH.

I am relatively young in my career, but one of the biggest lessons I have learned, unfortunately, is that perception matters more than reality in business. I have led the company and was consistently in the top 10 for sales when working remotely during covid, but now they are trying to make me RTO anyway. If lazy John is staring at his computer doing nothing or slacking off while in the office, people will be happier than if he does the same thing when WFH. 

Studies I have seen suggest workers in the office get ~3 hours of work done a day anyway and the rest is just pretending to work in the office, i.e., its an act in the office and perhaps the mask comes off when WFH for some people.

vc1fdc,"As a software engineer I can tell you that there are many advantages of working from the office when there are other people around you. It really isn't about the bosses wanting to see people, there are a lot of intangibles that you miss when remote. We have a young team and training is much easier in person than it is remote.

When you don't have your earphones in, there are often a lot of hallway conversations. I have jumped into conversations many times over the years when I had helpful answers. It is also useful to just hear what people are discussing. You learn to tune it out when you need to get work done and it just becomes background noise like your music.

I also like being able to just slide over to another person's desk and work with them. All of this is lost when one or both people are remote. I feel that the interruptions are outweighed by the benefits of collaboration.

However, many people who do go into the office wear earphones all day so they are not interrupted as often. They like the silence or music and find that they are more productive that way. If you are going to do that all day, there is very little advantage of being in the office because you are still not participating in conversations.

I now work from home 4 days a week and I often miss going to the office. We have ""collaboration Wednesdays"" where the office buys food so many people go in. There isn't a whole lot of advantage of going in more than that because so few people are there to talk to and I can do my job just as well from home. Many people moved and are permanent remote.

It should also be the responsibility of the employer to set deadlines assign assign work so that employees know what work they have to do, and the employer isn't just dumping it on their lap 30 minutes before they hope to leave for the day.

At the time, there was a lot of talk about being downsized so I freaked out and I applied to a sales position within the company because it was a work from home position. I interviewed for the position and got it 2 days later. I ended up loving the position and made tripled my previous salary which doesn't say much but I had been out of work for over a year and was desperate so it took the job. 

There are tons of sales jobs that are also work from home because technically you do not need an office to be productive. I ended up in inbound sales up until August of this year so I was in IB for almost a year. I recently got promoted to a chat sales department where I am still selling insurance but I do it via chat. I like this position much more because I get paid to sit on my ass and chat with people who are interested in buying auto/home/mc/boat/pup etc, policy's. Needless to say the job can be done at home so I never have to return back to an office. There are so many benefits of working from home. My company even pays for my internet and my cellphone bill. They give me $80/month to pay for it. They also sent me all brand new equipment for the position. 2 24"" Dell monitors, computer, keyboard, mouse, video camera and a headset, all brand new so I didn't have to spend my own money. However, I did upgrade my setup to a 29"" uw because my role needs more screen RE and I purchased wireless keyboard, mice, and headset. 

If you can find a sales job with a good company they will give you the same things.

Do remote workers remain with those companies longer? Does that mean less training of new hires is required, and more braintrust is retained if employees are happier and staying longer?

If your manager knows that you're quitting and have a thing about driving then they should not make you go in.

Just in case this helps you or anyone at all!

I do work as a Claims Call Center Specialist I for National General Insurance. It is a remote position (I'm not sure if you have to be in specific states or not so if anything just keep that in mind) where they shipped all the equipment to me. I do also get an $80 reimbursement for internet monthly which is standard for all work from home employees to get. The pay rate could vary based on experience (I'm not 100% sure if it does matter if you've had any previous call center experience so that is something to also possibly keep in mind.), But for me I get paid $20 per hour and get a 10% shift differential for being on a schedule that starts after 10:30 AM which has me making $22.11 per hour in total. It is only a full time position as they do not allow part time for this position. They do also pay while you are training which for me was I believe just 2-3 weeks where they paid the full $20 per hour with no shift differential since that started at 10:00 AM. But, it is possible that the pay during training will be a smaller amount. And the same thing goes for the pay rate of this position, I had 9 months of call center experience prior to working here so it is very possible that experience helps with the pay rate, but I've never questioned about it so I truly don't know. And also if you stay with them for at least a year, then you become eligible to apply for different positions within the company where, for example, if you wanted to become a licensed claims adjuster, (this is something my manager told me so it is possible this could have changed, so also keep that in mind as well) they would pay fully for the training it takes to get that done and also handles paying for you to renew your license yearly (I believe).

Many people report that the first 2 hours after waking are their most productive; are we really asking them to spend those precious hours commuting? It does make some sense from the companies perspective, because the company doesn't pay for this time, nor do they usually directly pay for the cost of the commute (which can often take a hefty chunk out of your wage).""

""There's a large portion of the population who fit this description, and without casting any negative judgement, we have to be open and honest with candidates that if they're in this camp - they'll likely be unhappy working at Supabase. In the early days we thought that these people could adapt, or perhaps be able to satisfy their need for face to face interactions outside of work, but on the whole it wasn't the case. We actively try to reduce the number of meetings happening across the company (both in person and via video call) which increases friction with these folks. By not supporting this group, we're reducing the size of the population from which we can hire, but overall our hiring pool is still very much larger than the average in-person company.... **After all, the goal of hiring should be to source the absolute best person for the job. Statistically speaking it's unlikely that this person lives within an hour drive to your office.**""

""... Another huge benefit of hiring from anywhere is that you end up with an incredibly diverse team. This helps when selling to a global audience of developers, and ensures diversity of thought and a broad range of perspectives.""

**""A lot of people's hesitations around remote seem to stem from not having trust in their team to get things done without adult supervision. However, if I know anything about high performing teams, it's that you need to have mutual trust (which breeds psychological safety), and a shared model of what success looks like (metrics anyone?).

Some businesses no longer have the office space to house all their employees & plan to continue using remote work because their making money on this.

m1v7fk,"TL;DR - don't log in immediately upon waking; get up at the same time you did when you had to leave the house, use that time to shower & change, stretch & move. Prepare some food in case you get busy, and fill up your water bottle. Designate a stationary work area to set boundaries, listen to engaging background noise (podcasts, audiobooks, radio) and take your breaks!

~

In the beginning, I found it really difficult to adjust to working from home all of the time. I would literally just wake up at the last second, roll out of bed and log into work. Some days, I wouldn't even get out of bed, and I would just have the laptop with me. I started getting so lazy and drained, I'd forget to eat breakfast, not shower or change for at least half of the day - forget to breathe!

After a few months of this it started to take a toll on me and I felt quite exhausted. I realized that although I'm not a strict routine person, it was very important to incorporate a healthy and regular routine into this situation. Not only to feel fulfilled, but also to have some time to myself the way I had while getting ready for work in the morning and before leaving the house.

Personally, it took me a while to figure out the best strategy for myself. But I started to hop in the shower as soon as I woke up. I set up a designated space for my work. I was lucky to have this, but even if you're lacking space it's important to have some sort of a boundary. I also found that it increased my productivity, because I made this a stationary setup where I was no longer able to bring my laptop with me elsewhere (I could, but effort) as I had it hooked up to a keyboard, mouse, and dual monitors. This, for me, was the most important step in my process of creating a healthy work from home environment.

So, after my shower I would then turn my computer on and let the remote desktop load up while I made coffee, prepared some breakfast for later (as I don't usually eat straight away, but it would help me to not get so busy I'd forget to eat)  I would also fill up my water bottle because I also noticed i had a serious lack of water intake, especially compared to when I was in the office, because going for water stops with my colleagues was a way to get away, have a break from the desk, stretch & move.

I also thought it was helpful in the morning to get outside and go for a walk anywhere, for about 10 minutes, even if it was just to grab a coffee or pick something up from the store or pharmacy, check the mail - whatever. Because walking was a very normal part of my daily routine beforehand, getting about 8,000 steps a day on foot commute alone! Also, this lack of movement and exercise was starting to become apparent

Usually during the day now I like to put on podcasts, or some kind of background noise - talk radio, audiobooks, or music. Something that is easy listening, interesting at times, and keeps my brain engaged. While this may not work for everyone and could be distracting, I'm coming from a quite social and vibrant office and noticed that while at home I was spending more time on my phone throughout the working day than I would have at the office. Having something else to listen to or distract me from being at home, helped keep me accountable and focus on work.

Well, this turned is a novel LOL but I just wanted to share my complete experience! It can be hard, but keep trying it out and you'll figure out the best steps for you.

My work from home routine has gone through several stages, from waking up a minute before clock in time, to laying in bed with laptop and tv on, to working from the moment I woke up (even hours earlier) and working until I was too exhausted to think anymore, logging way more hours than usual.

But, in the end, I have found my groove.

I have been lucky and never gotten behind in my work, and eventually felt bored and started challenging myself. 

Suddenly, I started feeling pride in my work, feeling more accountable, and responsible for the work I produced.

 Now more than I ever, my confidence level in the work I produce is higher than it has ever been. Much more so now than it has ever been with Management always micro managing and hovering all the time.

I am an introvert and only truly happy when I am home. 

I have an amazing relationship and pets I cherish so much. I use to waste so much time at work just checking into my wifi home cameras, watching my pets while stuck at my desk.

The distractions in the workplace also use to drive me crazy, I needed headphones to drown out the noise most of the time and the mindless chit chat has always been a struggle for me.

I always avoided lunch rooms, and chose to work through my lunch instead.

Now, I have the best routine. Wake early, spend time with my family and pets. Make myself breakfast or coffee which I never use to do. 
I make an effort to take my lunch breaks now, and eating (I never use to eat lunch) 

Now, when I work, I actually feel like I have done a good job and proud of what I get done daily.

Its a very different world. I love it. 
My pets and family love it.

* I have my office (spare/guest bedroom), and that is for work and computer stuff. Nothing else. I do not work in other areas of the house. I do have my personal computer in here on a separate desk, but again, even that is a bit separated from ""work.""
* I have my daily ""power list"" to keep me focused on things I need to work on that day that may or may not be directly related to my job. Might be for a certification, or just self development, but I'm not just ""working""
* I have several zoom/""wine zoom"" calls a month - one team I worked with we would do that every now and then (none of my current teams do); my sister and I do a monthly one (she's on the other side of the country); my mother and I have a bi-weekly one
* I make time for my hobbies that get me outdoors and around people who I can shoot the shit with and just hang out and have a good time
* Every day I make time for workouts, one of which is outdoors (frequently regardless of the weather - yes, even in crappy weather - get outside for 45 minutes - say hi to a neighbor or just be out in nature)
* When the day is done, the computers are shut down, and I go focus on the rest of my life.
* Once a month or so I have a lunch meeting with someone - a colleague, a business partner, an entrepreneur friend, or just a friend who's conversation I find stimulating and bettering. Sometimes these might happen a couple times a month - I could make them happen weekly (especially if I meet up with different people), and might move towards that at some point here.
* I'm taking part in a challenge (self managed challenge) that requires me to really plan and regime my days, but also makes me ""take care of me."" That challenge isn't for everyone, but some variations exist that some find a better fit (75/Live Hard is what I'm doing)

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.  


This is very unlikely, most normal workfrom home jobs that are tied to specific companies don't allow travel like you might want. There are laws and tax implications that usually get in the way

  
. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

This is possible but harder, most common wfh job is call center I think, and wouldn't even call that moderately paid. IT is a good one, that doesn't usually need a degree, but you do need to have specific knoweldge for that

  
. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

This is also very unlikely, as most jobs require some sort of schedule, even salary I need to be available certain hours.

  
. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated  
The pay usually gets in the way here, the more the pay it is, the higher the demand but also the more focused the search is

  
. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study  


Sales, marketing, IT, programming are ones I think that would fit here that offer a chance at getting paid well

  
. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

Yeah thats a possiblilty for most work from home jobs.I do IT and the only thing saving me is there isn't robots to do actual hardware replacements that I have to do in person sometimes  
  
. As stress-free as possible

Stress free usually means a pay cut, I make probably 50-70% of what I would normally make in a commercial job that I do working for a college

wgqgd5,"I got hired last month to WFH doing T1 help desk stuff. This is also my first job being full remote. One important question I've asked during my interview with HR and my manager is would the company be providing me the equipment to work with? (Laptop, docking station, monitor, etc.) I would start off there as every company has a different policy on security/privacy and I would assume most would provide their employees with equipment their IT department sets up beforehand for new employees. This also helps separate work life from private life and you'll learn quick to keep those apart. Another question is the scheduling. How flexible is my schedule? Do I work in shifts or am I able to make my own schedule as long as it meets the 40/hr week requirement? This sets a foundation of is this going to be a routine job or will I need to be disciplined to make sure I work my hours. Judging from context, it seems discipline is the least of your worries. Now...to answer your questions:

1. I've only had to keep my camera on during orientation and the first few meetings with my manager during training. Once you get the ball rolling, cameras become an optional thing as your team will just call you via zoom or teams without camera enabled. You're right about there being etiquette. I try not do eat or drink while my camera is on but depending on the length of the meeting, sometimes those things can't be helped and it'd be best to move yourself or your face off camera and take a quick bite/sip. I used to vape but I quit earlier this year. I would also recommend not doing this for at least the first few meetings with camera (if possible, try not to do it at all during meetings) otherwise, chain smoke away. Also, I've never had a meeting go past an hour so an 8 hour meeting seems overkill unless they want to monitor you and make sure you're working which is a big no-no in this sub.
2. Your job title sounds like you'll mostly be doing data entry and only answering phones when there's high call volume. I would say that you will definitely have time to do a quick check in on the misses and child. I'm sure you'll be able to do that multiple times a day including during your lunch break which would be great because now you have an extra hour each day in your life to spend with them compared to working in office.
3. I can only speak from my short experience of WFH since I'm still less than a month in but I do have to say...it'll be the best thing you'll experience in your life occupation wise. Ever since I started WFH, it's been a little weird at first because I'm used to waking up early, getting ready for commute, working in office, then commute back home when sun is almost gone. I then have to worry about cooking dinner and cleaning and by the time I'm done, it's bedtime and I rinse/repeat the cycle for 5 days a week. NOW, I have the freedom to wake up later, not have to worry about making lunch because I can make home lunch at home, take MULTIPLE breaks throughout the day, and work on house chores so that when my shift finishes, I have time to myself. I've definitely seen myself become less stressed and I'm grateful for having this opportunity to WFH. I can honestly say I will have a hard time finding another job after this because I've been spoiled from the time I started working...not just because of my personal benefits but the company I got hired to work for has been nothing but great and they've been taking care of me from day 1.

I can go on and on about this but this is basically my ted talk on how great working from home is and I'm sure many others can attest to the same thing. Hope this helps and good luck with your new job, OP!

There is an interactive process for ADA accommodations that hopefully the company is following and working with the person on. The process goes through steps and takes some time. It can lead to re-assignment to a new job (at the pay etc of that role), if/when the job opens up. This is typically not the first option though. 

The other thing that can occur is employees paint themselves into a corner with their documented disability. Basically they document they can not perform x duty. It turns out the x duty is required and not something that can be accommodated reasonably. 

Really weird twist... in one of the areas we operate if a person is WFH, the employer is the one responsible to assure their home meets the same criteria for workplace safety as any other office site. So if a WFH person said, I need an accommodation of no noise (at my home) the employer would be in a tough spot to assure their home met the requirements.

If you got the job, it was meant to be and to be honest if you believe in GOD your life is already planned so there's not much you can do about it. I wouldn't worry about the job until after you start. Take it one day at a time and I guarantee you will be successful and if it's a good company you will find out during the first week. Make your own opinions and take the rest with a grain of salt. Keep in mind that former employees are not going to speak well of the company no matter what. Only the people that got fired or were wronged will spend the time to voice their opinion not the ones that have been there for years. 

I've been at my company for about 2yrs and I started work from home work from home with this company over a year ago. They supplied me with all the tech to do my job and I have never been late and I used to only be paid a salary when I first started to now being a sales leader at my company making the same salary but also commission of an average of $5k per month. Not a whole lot but it's a lot to me because my salary is $35k. This year I've doubled my pay from last year. I did not come to this company thinking that I would grow. It was just a job at the time but I made it into a career. Don't worry too much until you start and after you start keep looking for other remote jobs as backup for when you want to leave. I would try and get into insurance sales like me. It's always needed and a computer can't do the job. You will always have security in sales if you're good at it.",WashCapitals77,1634604536.0
qauy08,You've already done enough and worrying now before the job starts is only going to cause you more anxiety. A customer service role work from home is not a bad one. If the pay is good then it's all good. Contracts can always be extended and how bad could a customer service job be when you work from home? It can't be that bad and I'm sure you'll get proper training and the trainer should be a good person to find out about whether the company is a good or bad company. Now stop worrying. Good luck!,WashCapitals77,1634605505.0

Option 1 I stay WFH full time with zero changes as per my contract. (They refused) 

Option 2 We renegotiate my salary to accommodate RTO as now I have expenses I did not have when I initially accepted the salary they offered as that salary was contingent on a full time WFH position. (The 14k i took as a paycut for this position since it was WFH....They refused) 

Option 3 I leave. I pointed out they're on a hiring freeze; we're already down 4 staff members; and I do the work of 3 people. As well im HIGHLY desirable and ill have an offer by end of the week. (""If that's how you feel...."") They didn't believe me; I put in my notice in 3 days for an EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY notice and the note ""You have 24hrs to counter my current new offer, you know my terms. ""

qdinkf,I'm zoomed out. Nothing irritates me more being in an office to just sit on zoom/teams/WebEx. WFH isn't new and this was the norm before COVID. We sat in conference room and conference remote people. There is a way to make them feel inclusive. Make sure your Conf rooms have smart AV. Owl is pretty good and inexpensive:),jimmt42,1634948218.0
qdinkf,"Yeah my company let us do 1 day a week remote pre-COVID and we'd miss so much in meetings when working remote. Needs proper buy in from management too, our senior leadership got annoyed when we all synced our WFH day since our team had no physical presence those days. So we either have some lacklustre meetings or sacrifice our WFH day all together, obviously everyone chose the former.",big_lemon_jerky,1634919997.0
qdinkf,"The smart way to do hybrid isn't by mixing remote and non-remote workers from the same department, on the same teams.  It's letting departments, like support workers, who don't need to be in an office just to sit on a computer all day, work from home. 

It should also be  an option for anyone who needs it and has a position that can be done from any computer, like pregnant or new mothers and fathers, it could be an option to work from home instead of using sick days, or coming to work sick infecting the office, or other flexible ways. 

If you're concerned about missing side conversations, then you need to go into the office. You can't have it both ways. Especially if you asked to be remote.",LincHayes,1634984815.0
qdinkf," I don't really think that hybrid work is completely around remote meetings though. So that shouldn't be the deciding factor of whether or not to be hybrid, onsite, fully remote, etc. Is it more convenient to do one over the other? Probably. But more convenient for the company's ops. There's a lot more that goes into the decision. Hybrid means that there's a lot more flexibility for remote workers. 

I'm completely remote because that's what's been working best for my lifestyle. However, there are colleagues, especially through the pandemic, who struggle with WFH because they have small spaces (i.e. live in the downtown core) and so WFH just isn't feasible. Plus, other people might prefer the office environment. So, ultimately offering more flexibility means that you're able to have a larger talent pool.

It's not perfect by any means, but there are ways to make it better for everyone (hence the article!)",hiba-amin-soapbox,1634931328.0
qdinkf,"Well, not almost everything. Some things.  Jobs done 100% on computers can mostly be done from home. That's not the reality of most people in most industries.

Also, everyone who wants to work from home, isn't ready to work from home. Meaning they don't invest in their tools, or infrastructure so that when they're needed to collaborate or conference they're putting out a great presentation.

They got the company laptop and that's it. Everyone else looks like crap, so it must be OK to look and sound like crap from home. 

I've been in enough collab meetings or Zoom calls where I'm wondering how people are still having latency issues, or look like they're using a potato as a webcam, or are still struggling with bad sound and lighting. A year later.  It's a terrible experience for everyone. I can understand why some bosses would be tired of struggling with that.",LincHayes,1634989772.0
qdinkf,"You're pretty focused on your own experience and not considering other industries and experiences. Most jobs CANNOT be done remote. It's only IT and knowledge workers who can do this. Most people have to physically be at their jobs.

>Personally, it's the employer's responsibility to provide employees withadequate tools. If any boss is frustrated with bad call quality, well,they should rectify that themselves.

If it's a remote job from the start, yes, and they usually do.

If it's not originally meant to be WFH and employers are accommodating you...I  believe that you should invest in your tools. For me the whole point of WFH is being able to use my own tools, not just the basic crap that the company gives everyone. That's just me.

I think it's short-sighted to want it both ways. WFH means you're responsible for your work environment now. This is something people are asking for. I don't think it's too much to ask that they keep up the professionalism, or as a boss, it's not worth it. Come back to the office.

WFH should not mean a sacrifice in the quality of your communication, presentation,  and professionalism.

If I'm making decisions on who will be allowed to continue WFH and who needs to come back to the office, the people who haven't upped their home game, who it is a struggle to communicate with, and don't know how to use their remote tools well... I'm making them come back to the office.",LincHayes,1634992268.0
qdinkf,">I even said that WFH isn't an option in some sectors by their very nature (a train driver cannot WFH), but in the rest 99% of the roles can be done from home.

That's just not true, I don't care how many times you repeat it. 99% of all jobs cannot be done remotely. 

>I wouldn't even consider a role where the company doesn't provide equipment or won't reimburse my own purchases.

Understandable, and most do. But no company will ever issue equipment that's better than my own. I wouldn't my own computer for their work, but for most other peripherals and infrastructure I'd rather use my own stuff.  It's a personal choice, not a debate.",LincHayes,1634994451.0
