ob3upv,Can my work monitor my personal computer through remote desktop?,"I recently started a new job working remotely. I have a work laptop and some monitors they gave me to use. The thing is that I prefer my own home office setup which includes a couple of larger monitors on arms at my desk. If I used my personal computer to remote into my work laptop which is at home with me, is there any chance they can monitor my personal computers information/traffic through that connection. It doesn't seem like it to me but I like to make sure my personal data stays separate from my work life while still enjoying the home office I already have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting/comments/ob3upv/can_my_work_monitor_my_personal_computer_through/,1625079125.0,12,5,telecommuting
gvgh93,How do you get a promotion when you work in a remote office?,"For good or ill, many people rely on in-person relationships to further their careers. It's one reason that some folks have been reluctant to work remotely; they miss out on the opportunities for lunch with the boss, or the brainstorm session in the hallway. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" they say. But suddenly, with people working in home offices, everyone has to find new ways to show off.

I'm writing an article compiling practical how-to tips for people working from home on ""how to stay on your boss's radar"" and ""how to manage up."" What advice do you have to share?

Ideally: Give me a bullet point (""Do XYZ""), why (""It accomplishes \_this\_""), and perhaps an anecdote sharing how it made a difference.

Please don't expend energy telling me why it's important, or what the barriers are. Take that as a given.

4733yw,Telecommuting/remote work laws? [x-post from /r/legaladvice],"First of all, thanks for the responses in advance.

I'm moving to Northern Virginia, where I'll be residing for the foreseeable future. I was offered a relatively enticing full time remote work position in Miami (meaning, the office is in Miami but I would be working from home in NoVA full time), but before signing everything I'd really like to read up on remote work laws, particularly laws regarding working remotely from out of state.

I just really want to sort everything out and get more information, ranging from really important stuff like taxes (am I at risk of being taxed by both states?) to how does workplace law translate over to a remote work situation.

If you could point me over to a couple of resources where I could read into this or if you have any experience doing this kind of remote work, I'd be really grateful.

nhxokr,Ultimate List of 100% Fully Remote Work From Anywhere Companies,"Hello everyone, I'm wondering if there is a site or list of all the companies that are fully remote and let you work from anywhere in the world? Or at least almost anywhere. I've seen a lot of companies offering remote options, but most of them don't specify if you can work anywhere or it's only remote within the US. I plan on not staying in the US long term, so I'm looking specifically for companies that don't care where you live in the world. I'll maintain an address and residency somewhere for tax purposes, but I want the freedom to travel to different places around the world while I work and not have to worry about my employer caring or finding out. Which companies allow this? Has anyone made a list or should we compile one together?

Your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting/comments/nhxokr/ultimate_list_of_100_fully_remote_work_from/,1621617181.0,10,20,telecommuting
asfg4p,The Remote Work Danger Zone,"There are some positive things about working in an office with other people:

* People can have coffee/lunch together to build friendships;
* There are watercooler conversations that could turn into ""aha"" moments for the team;
* Information can be shared easily with a team member by simply walking over to someone else or standing up to make an announcement.

If a team is remote, these situations can't happen in a physical space, so people need to make an effort to create these types of experiences in a virtual environment. Even with the best of intentions and the cultural desire to make this happen, the reality is if a large majority of the team is co-located in an office, it's difficult to remember or see the need to include the people who work remotely. Companies have varying scenarios in which individuals are considered to be remote workers; some employees work in the main office, while others might work in satellite offices or from home. Moreover, some companies have no offices at all! There is a danger zone in terms of the number of employees in an organization that has some part of the team working remotely. Being in this zone can be very difficult for both the employee and the company.

Here's the spectrum I mean:  [https://imgur.com/a/ixze0Do](https://imgur.com/a/ixze0Do)

Let's look at the possible scenarios:

* **A company in which 100% of the employees work in one office**. In this scenario, the company has no employees that work remotely. Everyone is in the office five days a week, or maybe working from home is an unusual exception. There is no issue here because everyone benefits from the watercooler effect described above.
* **A company in which 99.9999% of the employees work in one office**. If one individual works remotely, he/she is not privy to all the watercooler benefits that being in an office would provide. However, the overhead costs needed to develop a remote-enabled infrastructure or culture for one remote employee doesn't make sense. The person who works remotely has the hardest time obtaining information from the team since he/she is easily forgotten and most communications and meetings happen face-to-face. You've probably seen it before: your public Slack channels are dead and the comments on your GitHub issues are non-existent. Unless the person really needs zero context apart from the tasks assigned to him/her, this isn't an issue. However, if the remote employee must make any decisions that depend on input from others, or if his/her input could be used to help make decisions, this could hurt the company. This negative outcome can occur until a large percentage of the company's work force is remote.
* **A company in which around 50% of the employees work remotely and/or in satellite offices**. Once a company has enough remote employees that must be included in conversations to move the company forward, the lack of information dissemination/conversations with everyone in the company has a major impact on the decisions that must be made for the organization. Once a company hits this point, moving to an asynchronous communication and implementing online company management strategies is really the only way to continue with the remote practices. Once this is established and people feel they are contributing to meaningful decisions, they can work from home, or, the key indicator, work from anywhere in the world without being less productive (or even more productive). This is an effective way to ensure the health of a remote-enabled company.
* **A company in which 100% of the employees work remotely**. Once the majority of a company's employees work remotely, and the organization is moving along smoothly, the hardest part is over. Growing to a situation in which 100% of workers are remote (if that's the desire) is not as challenging as going from 0% remote workers to 50% remote workers.

The key takeaway here is that while having a remote team creates a strong competitive advantage for a company, there are growing pains as teams shift from having a small number of individuals working remotely to a large number. Having this in mind during the growth phase will help the transition. Knowing is half the battle.

432edl,New Remote Job. Need help with socializing.,"I just landed an excellent job that will challenge me in my career.  I work in Cloud.  The great thing besides nearly doubling my salary is that I work remote.

This is a double edge sword for me.  Where I came from in my previous company was a Google-esque company.  Very engaging and frenetic in a good way.  You always had people around you.  It was to a point it was almost invasive, but the company culture changed a few years back and now it's being a bit stagnant and has silos.

I still thing going in the office and having the option to work from home on days is great.  I'm not sure about the 100% remote thing.  I'm a bit scared that I will self isolate myself.

I also think that I will be one of the younger guys there being in my early 30s.  My last company much of the work force was under 35. So there may be a slight culture shift for me.

The company itself seems very engaging and still much into a start up mode and there will be travel.  No doubt about the company.  I just feel that remote work will make me go crazy and I won't be able to have a social life.  I fear being alone.

9fre6v,Question from an employer about starting to have remote employees,"I've been trying to push the rest of the leadership team where I work to be more accepting of remote workers.

I am not a lawyer, so I don't know how to respond to one particular question that came up.

In the days before telecommuting, it was normal that the country that someone lived in was always the same as the country of the employer. And so if a company was incorporated in country A, then of course everyone employed by the company had to have the right to work in country A because otherwise they wouldn't be able to turn up to the office.

I always assumed that a visa that gave you the right to work in a country was giving you the right to live in that country and work there. I always assumed that if you are employing someone from country B when your company was incorporated in country A, that the employee needed a ""right to work"" in country B only. Work rights to country A were irrelevant if the person was never going to step foot in country A.

But everyone else seems to assume that in that situation, the employee needs work rights in country A as well, even though they will never pass through immigration in country A, so no-one will ever know whether they actually had work rights there or not.

Does anyone know what the situation is?

4q90s4,How to deal with being ignored as a remote worker?,"Hi all,

I've been working 95% remotely as a freelancer for the past several months, and I might be about to take a 100% remote position as a full-time employee.

I wanted to ask about something that's been bothering me, because I can't be the only one who's experienced this.

As a remote worker, how do you deal with being ignored? There seems to be an ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality that some people have toward people on a team who are remote--you can't blame them for it, since when remote workers are the minority, it's natural. I have a few techniques I use to combat it, like overcommunicating in comment threads, linking between threads, making sure to communicate through public chat channels, etc., just basically making myself as visible as possible in spite of not physically being there.

However, I've noticed that with some people, it's not that they're innocently not thinking of me because they don't see me. They seem to be blatantly ignoring me. This actually isn't even specific to remote work. In my last full-time job, there were certain people who I just could never get a hold of. I would politely send them emails and chat messages during regular working hours, and they would take 5+ hours to respond, if they responded at all. The only way I could get their attention is if I went up to their desk, and just stood there until they were forced to acknowledge me. With remote work that isn't even an option.

With one freelance client I have now, I only live about 30 minutes away from their office, so I COULD go in if I wanted to--but I feel that I should not have to be coerced into doing it when it isn't necessary. That place is a whole 'nother issue though, they've been trying (unsuccessfully) to manipulate me into being a traditional employee that sits in the office all day for months now, and I'm not having it. I should probably set them straight or just abandon the contract, but I genuinely like the work I'm doing for them.

With companies that ""believe in"" remote work and are properly set up for it, I haven't had any issues like these.

Maybe I'm just not being assertive enough. Do any of you have any experiences you're willing to share?",https://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting/comments/4q90s4/how_to_deal_with_being_ignored_as_a_remote_worker/,1467114731.0,11,17,telecommuting

I apologize in advance if this type of post is unacceptable in this sub.

**However...**

So I've developed this website for about a year. It's called [Periodix](https://periodix.net/), Artificial Intelligence that searches or browses jobs from all over the web for you. It shows projects with the highest chances to be hired for you.

**Main Purpose:**

\- It finds remote or otherwise flexible jobs from all over the web leveraging AI

\- It saves your time for searching projects for your profile.

\-You see the possibility of being hired on a job.

**Website features:**

\- Google Chrome Extention for getting new updates faster;

\- Jobs without scams. Periodix analyses all projects and it shows real projects for you;

\- You save your time for searching because of everything in one place;

\- You can filter jobs for your interests, budget, and country;

\- Periodix shows projects for your location;

\- You can teach the algorithm if a project isn't for your skills.

**Note on the above:**

We continue to add new job boards. You can get more projects every month.

**A few limitations:**

\- The website IS NOT PERFECT.

\- Since this is largely an aggregator, you may occasionally see some repeat entries, or even NON-remote jobs. That's why you can teach the algorithm for making it better.

**Some fun / useless facts, in case this matters at all:**

You save up to 10 hours per week by getting a personal list of jobs that match your skills and have a high chance of hiring.

37gdoa,[Jobspresso] Helping telecommuters find high-quality remote careers,"Hey guys,

Not sure about everyone else, but we've always felt that finding a telecommuting job is tougher than a traditional job, since very few companies offer them. It takes a lot of research to separate the wheat from the weeds.

So we decided to do something about it.

We've recently launched a tech-focused job board that aims to help telecommuters find high-quality remote careers:

http://jobspresso.co

Compared to other remote job boards, we spend time to ensure every remote job is legitimate and open, by reviewing the employer's website, career page, social media accounts and general reputation. The end result is that you only see real remote jobs at interesting and thriving companies. We take care of the legwork so you don't have to.

We're really excited about launching this site, and hopefully you'll find it useful. 

What do you guys think? Is there anything that we can do better? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/telecommuting/comments/37gdoa/jobspresso_helping_telecommuters_find_highquality/,1432731295.0,17,16,telecommuting

Using a throwaway account here. I have an employment offer from a remote software company whose code base/roadmap etc are open source. I checked them out and I feel like an imposter now.

Things in their roadmap are things that I've never done before. Reading issue descriptions - I have no idea how to do them if they were assigned to me after I join. While I have been a very competent engineer all my career, I am stressed out like never before seeing all this stuff their engineers are already doing. I do not know if I will be able to perform. This is also going to be my first remote job, so I am extra stressed about that as well.

I am tired of feeling jealous of folks who get to travel and see the world while working and earning their living, I would love to make the leap but am unsure about how I should go about it. 

Brief background and skills overview: 

I was born in Russia, raised in the US, went to school and college in France and the UK. Fluency in the three languages at a level that makes native speakers believe I am one. (hold French and Russian citizenship). MSc degrees from Paris and London engineering schools, honours from the British one which is quite a good school in the UK (Imperial College London). 

Degrees are in Physics but went into coding then (just had enough of labwork, but the physics and statistics background is there). Did lots of coding in c++ for theses, some obscure stuff like LabView, Matlab, Mathematica. Working at a bank since graduated, just five years now, the oldies there taught me mainframe (so that's Cobol, JCL, DB2 SQL, TSO and the whole caboodle that goes with it) and the last two years have been honing me into an old tech/new tech hybrid (they want to train a data scientist, they said). 

They are really nice, the people at work :) But I don't want to climb a career ladder, I want to be free and travel :) 

Surely I should be able to do something with this ;_; Without the need to branch out yet again into web dev or whatnot (?) I can pick another coding language (or 'language' language) up quite easily I reckon, if need be. 

Opinions? Please please please and thanks again! Have a great day :)

I can't understand why employers would insist that their employees return to the office when they can work from home, except perhaps to occupy the office space they rent.

Who wants to :

\- Be stuck in traffic for hours

\- Dress up in office mode every morning

\- Cashing in on the commute

\- Miss out on magical moments with your loved ones

\- Running out of time to live your passions and enjoy life The world of work isn't what it used to be.

We've redefined what's ""normal"".

Companies need to wake up and embrace change.

17zp56n,Regret the return to office - remote work actually saved me more money,"I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it. I know I made a lot of dumb mistakes, but I want to fix my situation.

What you need is a skill or ability that is in demand that can be done at home. Then you need to get really good at that skill so you can negotiate a work from home position. They're not just gonna hand it out usually it is a thing you have to earn.

179wsjj,The most powerful life hacks I've discovered for Remote work,"I've started working remotely with COVID and it's now a lifestyle many of us have embraced forever. But with the freedom of a home office comes unique challenges--staying productive, maintaining work-life balance, and navigating the nuances of virtual communication, just to name a few. Here are some life hacks I found very valuable for myself to find a good balance working remotely.

**Get Outside**

Just 15 minutes out in the sun can help set your circadian rhythm, fire up your metabolism, and get your brain into high gear.

**2-3 hours work out of your home-set up to enter flow**

Contrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby cafe for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.

**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**

If we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.

If you start by your own you'll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for ""guided meditation"" (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.

**Say Thanks, Feel Better**

I've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.

**Write it Out**

Very similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.

**Get a Wise Council**

The most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.

**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**

We're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.

**Read, really read**

You'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book--any book--that piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.

**Cold shower in the morning**

This might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It's like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.

**Bed time alarm**

Don't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Set an alarm to remind you to start winding down. Ditch the tech, maybe read something light, and just chill. You're setting the stage for a killer day ahead.

195oka0,Do most remote jobs heavily monitor/micromanage you like mine does?,"I have a full time remote position at a very large company with thousands of employees. I like the work. I like my boss and coworkers. The pay is decent. I'm a responsible, hard worker with many years of experience and I can be trusted to do my work productively with no supervision. The problem is my employer's policies are, in my opinion, incredibly overbearing and treat me as if I'm an untrustworthy child.  I'm heavily monitored and micromanaged. Therefore, I'm thinking about looking for a new job but I'm worried that the way my company does things is now ""the norm"" and I wouldn't find a better situation so I don't know if it's worth bothering. 

At my job, I am required to be on camera all day,  every day, so they can take frequent photos of me to make sure I'm working. I HATE this. It's not because I'm lazy. I'm always at my desk working other than bathroom breaks. It's because I feel it is incredibly invasive and I feel like I can't scratch my face or eat a snack without someone watching. When you're at work in person,  your boss doesn't sit across from you staring at you intensely all day, and I feel the constant camera monitoring is the equivalent of that. I'm also not allowed to listen to music, have my phone, or have pets or another person in the room. The stated reason for the last few is fraud concerns, despite the fact I have no access to sensitive info. In my opinion, to want this much control over me and what goes on in my home is ridiculous.

On social media I see other WFH people talking about napping and going to the gym during the workday. I don't want that and in my opinion people who pull that shit are ruining WFH for the rest of us by making us look bad. However it DOES make me wonder if I just chose a bad company and most aren't like this. 

Please tell me this isn't the norm now. If it is, I might as well get an in-person job again. Ideally, I want a remote job where I'm not required to be on camera except for Zoom/Teams meetings and where the environment is relaxed enough that I can listen to Spotify and have my pets in the room.

1anljhi,"Why Everyone Should Cheer for Remote Work, Even If You Punch In On-Site","Here's the deal:

- Traffic's a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won't feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we're not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can't work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless.

1atbu5t,Remote work: the refuge from office life's decline,"The steady erosion of comfort in the modern workplace is nothing short of a cruel joke played on employees. Let's use a metaphor to better understand what's happening. 

Imagine an airline ripping out every last shred of dignity from its flights - seats replaced with rigid boards that offer all the comfort of a medieval torture device; meals, once a highlight, are now nothing but a distant memory, replaced by vending machines; legroom reduced to the point where knees kiss chins and one must become a master contortionist just to squeeze into their designated sliver of space. They also introduce 'economy minus,' a tier replacing seats with standing spots and harnesses dangling from the overhead bins, promising an experience similar to a crowded subway ride at 30,000 feet. The in-flight entertainment system, once a portal to a few fleeting moments of escapism, now stares back as a blank screen, a grim reminder of better days gone by.  Flight attendants morph from angels of hospitality into sales agents peddling bogus lotteries for an extra inch of legroom or a blanket.
Meanwhile, up in their gilded towers, airline executives scratch their heads in bewilderment as customers flee in droves, lamenting the ingratitude of the very passengers they've tortured. 

The absurdity continues on land, this time for real, cloaked in a veneer of corporate doublespeak. Warm and welcoming offices gave way to sterile, exposed workspaces where privacy is forbidden and silence is a rare jewel. Colleagues transform into involuntary voyeurs as the open office serves up a psychological endurance test. The doors to quiet rooms are ripped off, replaced by signs reading 'Collaboration Zone', where multiple loud conversations blend into a disorienting swirl of noise. The remaining meeting rooms are always booked up. Employees roam like nomads in search of desks on a hot-desking carousel, not very different from a game of musical chairs. Individuality melts away as the office evolves into a panopticon, where all actions are viewed through the gaze of surveillance. Every bite, breath, and smelly bathroom break now has an audience.  
Having churned their workplaces into bleak blenders of distractions, executives cry out in shock as employees resist their calls to return to these very spaces designed to suffocate the soul. They cannot comprehend the mass exodus from the matrix of 'innovations' they've constructed. ""Get off your high horse!"" they decry, oblivious to the pain they've inflicted. 

The imaginary decline of airline comfort is meant as a stark metaphor for the very real deterioration of office life. These so-called innovations expose a callous disconnect between executives and employees. As sanctuary emerges in the form of remote work, offering reprieve through autonomy and respect, the choice to skip the office becomes not just tempting, but essential. 

When comfort is ripped away and replaced with cruelty, remote work becomes the only rational response. This is why remote work is not going away any time soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1atbu5t/remote_work_the_refuge_from_office_lifes_decline/,1708202661.0,13,134,remotework

I don't think my firm will ever have an office, and working from home works out great for me and my colleagues, but is this something other people's employers have started talking about? How would returning to the office make you feel and what would you miss most about the flexibility of being able to work from home?  


Personally for me, working from home is something that brings a huge amount of value to my life, I have family abroad and being able to flex my hours to find cheap flights and work from my Grandma's house for a week or so makes all the difference to me (and possibly her) .  


TL;DR - do we think returning to the office is going to happen sooner rather than later and what would you do if your employer asked you to return to the office?

168vbw7,Remote work is rarely what you think it is,"I see so many say they're looking for entry level remote work that :

* Has flexible hours - show up whenever, work however long you want with breaks whenever and however long you want

* Allows you to travel and work from anywhere in the world

* Can be done while taking care of a newborns or toddlers

* Is easy and pays very well

* Can be done at the same time as another job 

Unless you have a degree and experience, most remote work doesn't include any of the above. 

I'm speaking from both sides of this coin. I was a supervisor with a semi-flexible schedule. I was primary and then sole caregiver for my son as he grew, but I wasn't on phones when he was young / in the ""could start screaming any second with no advance warning"" stage. I could often start work earlier than scheduled, and then take off early, but not always - if I had a meeting scheduled at the end of my normal shift, I was stuck. If I was working on a proposal of some sort, I could do quite a bit in my head while folding laundry or doing the dishes.  The pay was good, but the stress on my mental and physical health was bigger, and that's why I eventually quit. 

Currently in a specialist / customer service roll. Shifts are set and I can't start early. Even breaks and lunch are scheduled at specific times. Clocking in late (5 minutes is late) leads to occurrence points which add up to termination. Leaving early accrues the same occurrence points. The metrics you have to meet can be very stressful. You can't always get the days off that you want approved.

She gets out of bed at 7:55am. She has not showered or left the house in weeks. She makes a protein smoothie, puts her Meta Headset on. She logs in at 8:01am. An AI manager says, ""Good morning Alecia, I would like to remind you that work started at 8am"" She gets a 'bad point' on her profile. Her 'Meta Score' score drops from a 759 to a 758. Irritaded, she starts responding to emails. Her mom's birthday is today and she pauses to shoot her a text. Her AI manager pops in her headset and says ""Good morning, I see your email response rate has dropped 4.7% this morning. Please remember we have a corporate policy of [xyz] send rate.

tuyfc2,2 Years of Remote Work... Now Mandated to Return To Office,"2 years of flexibility, an improved work life balance, more productive work day, extra quality time with family and well being, additional savings, etc. POOF it's gone just like that.

My kids have soccer practice on Tuesdays at 5 PM. I can take them... oh wait, I can't - I'll be commuting home from work because Tuesday is a mandatory in office day. That's right, mandatory. Tuesday and Wednesday are now ""core"" days.

It doesn't stop there.

We also have to come in for a third day that ""works"" for the team. How are we going to organize that? Most people are going to want to work Mondays and Fridays from home. In order to take my kids to tee ball on Thursdays, I'll need to work from home that day. That pretty much guarantees that I will be the only one from my team in the office on Monday.

Really effective use of time and resources, right?

But, Tom, can't your partner take the kids to tee ball? Nope. She works in a hospital. She legitimately needs to be there in person. She works with patients and families during some of their most difficult times. Being there in person is very important for the emotional well being of the people she's there to help.

I, on the other hand, can easily work remote 100% of the time. There's no urgent need for me to be physically present. Even if I wanted to see the people I work with, I can't. The majority of them are hundreds to thousands of miles away. Nonetheless, my company wants me to spend 3 hours a day commuting in order to sit in an office just to have virtual meetings. Really effective use of time and resources, right?

Oh well, at least I can help my partner in the mornings getting the kids ready for school... oh wait, I can't - I'll be commuting. In order for me to make it in the office by 9:00 AM, I need to leave at 7:30 AM. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to say goodbye before I leave.

Purposeful in-office time is OK, but this one-size fits all approach for the sake of ""company culture"" is 3 steps backwards.

1bblk7y,How do I yell my boss I want to stay remote?,"I have been working for the same small company for over 15 years.  I started working remotely about 10 years ago when I had my first child.  The job I was doing at the time involved a component in which I was the only one that did it and therefore didn't need to have communication with people in the office.  So I left my full time job and kept that one part as my remote job. I was working for a micromanager to the extreme at the time and after working from home I got more work done than when I was in the office.

Over the years I've slowly taken on more projects.  I'm still part time but getting closer to full time.

My amazing boss who I experienced so much growth and confidence under was let go recently.  They re-hired the micromanager who had mostly retired and will be working from home because she lives outside of the state.  Something important to know about her is she is very adamant and serious about NEVER having a ""not my job"" attitude as a way to get people to do work on things she can't get someone else for or needs help with.

The office has had a hard time keeping the few admin staff they have and the office manager has joked with me multiple times over the years that she wishes I came back to help.  Well, she has recently mentioned in casual conversation that I'm likely going to become my bosses assistant because instead of focusing on my actual job she will expect help with projects.

Recently I found out the President of the parent company wants our branch to end remote work because he thinks people will work better when they exchange ideas in person.

The entire department I work in and the other department I work with are scattered throughout the US.  Each person but one was hired while living outside the state pre-pandemic.  One moved during. The CEO of our branch doesn't even live in the state.

Then, in my conversation with the President, he said something that made my stomach drop after already feeling bad about the remote work part.  He said ""then, since you will be in the office, you can help with admin stuff.""  I knew then that the remote working ending really just means me since I am the only one that I work with that lives in state and that this is about using me for the help I can provide, since they can't find someone else and I've been ""loyal"" for so long.

I am actively trying to find a new job but I absolutely do not want to come back and do not want to be demoted into helping everyone else.  But I am TERRIFIED of how my boss will react if I give her pushback.  I am not in a place mentally to handle that well.

13wwrxy,Remote Work vs. In-Office Work,"Hey folks, I am trying to decide whether or not to keep my current ""remote"" status at work or to transition to working in-office four days a week. I'd love any advice or helpful perspectives!

tl;dr Should I switch from working fully remotely near DC to working in the DC office four days a week? In-office comes with a pay bump, but also takes away the ""work from home"" perks.

For a little context...I am a 24 year old, single woman. I've worked in our Tech Comm department as a senior technical writer for over two years now and I like my job pretty well. I was hired during the pandemic when everyone at my company was working remotely, so I have never met anyone at my company in person. My team and supervisor now work from our California office, whereas I still work remotely from my apartment near our Washington, DC, office. When everyone returned to the office after the pandemic died down, our company gave us a choice. We could stay remote and keep our same pay, OR we could decide to come into the office four days a week, one day remote, but we would get a pay bump to account for commuting and cost of living. The ""locality"" pay percentage is based on which office we were commuting to (DC vs Cali). At the time, I chose to stay remote because my life was hectic, and I also figured commuting to the office would not be worth it since all my direct coworkers would be at the Cali office, and I would be commuting to DC.

I am considering changing my status to ""in-person"" and commuting to DC four days a week.

The pros: the pay bump (since I am paying to live near DC anyways and would just be adding in commuting costs, it would be a nice raise...also I have some credit card debt to pay off right now so money would be helpful), having more social interaction and meeting new people (working from home gets lonely), I think I would focus on work better/improve my work ethic, I could network better in-person with people even if they are not my direct coworkers, and I am kinda looking for a change. I graduated with my B.S. in the spring of 2020, so I have not been in a classroom, office, etc., since the world shut down. Also, if I decide I hate working in-office and want to switch back to remote, I have to give HR a month's notice, and they will allow it. Obviously, the pay bump goes away then.

The cons: commuting every day will be a pain sometimes, I know. I would take the metro rail/public transport, which is cheaper than driving but less predictable. I also would need to have a more stringent work schedule since, right now, I can easily accommodate later meetings/Pacific time zone for my Cali colleagues when needed. I will need to take PTO for things I am not used to, like if I want to visit family at the holidays I cannot just work from Minnesota for two weeks. It will also just be a big adjustment for me since it's been a long time since I have had to make sure I show up to an office on time or actually get up and look professional in the morning (we don't have cameras on over Zoom at my work). I will also just have less free time in my day, whether it be morning or evening. Let's be honest, working from home is nice in that sense....somedays I will work in pajamas outside on my patio. That is a luxury I would lose...Finally, given that most of my direct coworkers and people I ""interact"" with at work are in the Cali office, I really will not know anyone at the DC office and it may feel just as lonely as working from home.

Anyways, does anyone have any advice or perspective maybe from personal experience? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/13wwrxy/remote_work_vs_inoffice_work/,1685564229.0,1,2,remotework

18lhjqr,Is Remote Work Already Dead?,"The past week or two we've seen a flurry of articles talking about ""the return to office"" movement is dead. But after seeing some stats in the article and doing some digging it seems like remote work may be dead. 

So here's some of the most shocking stats I saw. Now in fairness stats are all over the place and certain articles and studies choose to push for WFH or return to office but from what I was able to gether... prior to covid something like 6% of workers were fully remote. During covid I saw a stat that 71% of workers were fully remote, that kind of surprised me it was that high, today apparently 12% of workers are fully remote. Now granted I'd say that probably a majority of workers are hybrid now which I think still sort of qualifies as remote and that's a win but were basically we've seen an 83% drop in remote work in the past year or two since covid measures ended. 

Overall it seems like most ofthe push of big companies going back into the office is done with the exception of Boeing, GM and one other that's slipping my mind at the moment. The current push seems to be federal, state and municipal public workers being pushed back into the office. 

I can't see a scenario where enmass a lot of companies decide to go remote at this point so it seems remote work is kinda dead. Agree or disagree?",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/18lhjqr/is_remote_work_already_dead/,1702928578.0,39,0,remotework

17cwtd4,Government jobs flush with remote work,"I see a lot of people wanting to work remote so figured I'd post this. I worked as a regulator in the state of Arizona. All state jobs have the option of working completely remote, hybrid, or on site (you get to pick). Pay is pretty good (I was making 65/year, plenty of people make 70k+ there), and they have a shared office for state workers (kinda like a WeWork) with snacks and whatnot. Benefits are also great.

 However there are some caveats...

1. You must work within state lines. You can work remote from anywhere in Arizona, but barring extreme circumstances (aka family member in another state dying) you cannot work outside of state lines. Even if you travel to California for vacay, you will not be allowed to log in to work.


2. The state does offer a pension. Mind you, you will be required to contribute ~12.5% per paycheck. They do match, but you only get the march after 10 years of service. But it's for all 10 years. So if you quit at year 9, you only get your contributions. If you hit year 10, you get the last 10 years of employer matching and every year past that 10 year mark.


3. There is a good amount of competition for these jobs given the remote work environment. But if you're willing to relocate and you get an interview, you're in a good spot.


Also, mind you, this is for the ""state of Arizona"". The city of Phoenix or Maricopa county jobs I don't think offer remote work options (or they might but limited) so just make sure you keep an eye on that.

* The industry I do remote work in is very very clique-y. For example there are technology providers in my industry a company may use equipment from Vendor A or Vendor B. My background is with nearly ALL the vendors in my field so unlike many people I do not get rejected because oh Tech does not have experience with X Vendor.
* I have 20+ years of experience and 10 years of direct experience in the job I will be remotely working. I have worked for a competitor to this company 2 years ago. I know the job I will be doing and did it well for my previous similar employer.

**Why did the position I am applying for go ""Remote""?**

* The reason it was shifted to remote was that people with my skills and background are very very RARE. While most positions at this company are NOT remote they reluctantly made this a remote position so that they have a ""chance"" of hiring someone like me. 
* Also for this particular company I do not reside in any city they have major operations. I made this a prerequisite for any job I take. IF I take a job for a company with offices in my area... eventually I will be ""volun-told"" to go into the office... thus no longer having a ""remote"" position.

**What was the job search like?**

* All and all it took 9 solid months of passive interviewing, calling and otherwise seeking a new remote position. I started remote with my current position and they have now made me ""hybrid"" and I don't like going into the office that much so I decided to look.
* So it's a good thing to realize I have stellar education, I have stellar experience, I have stellar certifications... and even for ME remote work is NOT a slam dunk. I have applied/interviewed for around 30 positions. So again even for people like me who have a great deal of demand for their skills and work. Remote positions are STILL pretty hard to get.

**Things I learned in looking for a Remote Work Position**

* Passive looking is the BEST for ultimately landing a fully Remote position. I can't tell you the times that if I actually apply for a position they pull the ""bait and switch"" and say we don't do fully Remote, this will be Hybrid or in office. To which I always said nope!
* Today people ARE NOT willing to interview you outside of business hours (in my experience) so you have to juggle the interviews during work days. Luckily my present work is flexible. But for people who are in the office again I think taking interviews will be more difficult.
* Be prepared for a few false flags and fake remote positions. I had one recruiter swear to me that X company would do remote when I had worked at that company and KNEW they did not. Also a few companies changed their policy of hiring of people outside their office areas during interviews.
* Get used to a lot of bureaucracy with companies these days. Remote work is complex to account for if a company does not have tax and legal setup in the state you work in... it can take a great deal of time for them to ""hire"" you remote. 
* Remember to exercise patience in the process. If you really really need a job Remote work seems to be TWICE as long to get on boarded as in office jobs. So if you need a job don't insist on remote work... it would be a waste of everyone's time.

Summary of Emma Goldberg's 'research':

\- Remote workers say they love flexibility but are actually ""confused"" by hybrid work schedules and need routine. They're feeling ""stressed, uncertain, and anxious"" and are in a ""malaise."" She cites a stat about 40% of workers being unhappy with their jobs. (Couldn't possibly be because of wages and cost of living? How much of that 40% don't \*have\* flexible schedules?)

\- Working from home makes workers feel like cogs in a machine.

\- Remote workers are less able to network or advance in their careers, and are missing out on ideas, feedback, and bonding.

\- Workers need to be more ""excited"" about going to the office, which will happen by having things like exercise classes and more happy hours.

194wg5t,Question for anyone who has moved while in a remote/WFH job,"UPDATE!!!  Just talked to HR and they will NOT be adjusting my compensation when we move.  YAYYY!!

--

I started a new job in December, fully remote/WFH.  Entire company is remote/WFH.

I live in Upstate NY, an hour northwest of Albany, about halfway between Saratoga Springs NY and Bennington VT.

My salary is $70K per year pre-tax.

Due to my partner's job we are relocating to Chattanooga TN.  This has been in the works for a while and my company takes no issue with it (I will still be in the same time zone and the company is a registered entity in Tennessee - it's a registered entity in 47 out of 50 states).

My question is, do companies adjust compensation based on where you live?  The cost of living in Chattanooga is significantly lower than where I am now, even though I am literally in the boonies (I  live in a small village surrounded by farmland, the closest grocery store is 20 minutes away) and Chattanooga is an actual city, albeit a small one.

I know there's probably no hard and fast rule here as each company is different, but was curious to hear from anyone here who has relocated while in a WFH job if your company has adjusted your comp in any way.

Asking out of curiosity because it will affect our budget for how much we can afford to pay in rent if my yearly comp changes and I'm trying to plan ahead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/194wg5t/question_for_anyone_who_has_moved_while_in_a/,1705069953.0,15,14,remotework

I'd really like to escape yet another scenario where I return to work in an IT setting where I can do 99% of my job from home. Most of my gigs have been local for a while now and I haven't had to do a lot of job searching in quite a few years, so I'm wondering where to even begin?

I've worked in IT in various roles for the past 15+ years of my life. My most recent role was a Sr Network Engineer but I consider myself mostly a Sysadmin / Netadmin / Level 3 tech. I have experience managing small teams, I also have 5 years of community management experience under my belt and have been doing freelance writing since 2010 and had various paid gigs in the tabletop RPG scene over the past decade or so. However, given that ""writing for elf games"" and managing the communities around them aren't really valid skills for any remote jobs really I'm resigning myself to seeking out more IT work.

That said, I haven't had much luck. I've found a lot of jobs that seem dubious, or like outright scams on places like Indeed and SimplyHired. Is FlexJobs worth paying for? I honestly kind of don't know where to begin, but if I'm going to stay in the soul-sucking field of IT I'd really prefer to do it from the comfort of my own home.

17aq4ql,Remote working is DEAD!,"Or is it?  


Lately, there has been a lot of news mentioning the end of the remote work. Many big companies have issued statements forcing employees to return to the office.

The amount of remote job offers has declined. Is it time to go back to the ""normal"" working environment?

Those are all the comments you'll see floating around. But the reality is different.

  
Let me explain.

Yes, the amount of job listings for remote positions has declined compared to the COVID era. Why?  
During COVID lockdowns, the companies were forced to operate remotely! It wasn't a natural growth of the remote job market. 

*It was a forced anomaly! A Spike!*

As they had no other option than to operate remotely, that's what they did. The executives and managers had to overcome their biases towards remote work. They had to learn to operate in this new situation.

But those companies have never been ""remote-friendly"" places in the first place. So now that they can have people back in the offices, that they spend crazy amounts of money on. They want you back in!

The pandemic era was an anomaly, a spike in remote markets, and we have to see it as such. It wasn't an organic growth and adaptation of WFH practices. Just an anomaly.

&#x200B;

Going back to the current state of the remote job market.

If we compare the data from the pre-pandemic level to now, [the amount of remote jobs is much higher.](https://remotedom.com) But also, the interest and desire for remote-friendly positions is growing massively.

The pandemic has done a lot of good for the remote job market. Before, most people have experienced the benefits and freedom of working remotely. It also tore down a lot of biases and misconceptions about working remotely.

Is remote work dying? No, it's actually growing!

More companies are remote-first, not just remote-friendly. The managers are looking favorably at remote hiring. It saves costs and improves employee satisfaction.

1404mru,I Am Having Trouble Finding Remote Work At Home...," 

Since graduating high school, I have always wanted to work remotely from home - preferably with a flexible schedule - to earn some decent income and assist my aging parents. I live in a small rural town that offers very little in terms of job growth or sufficient income that could help my parents pay their bills. All jobs in my area are minimum wage(I live in Washington State, so the minimum wage as of this current date is $15.74,) And with the cost of living rising,(not to mention it being exacerbated by current inflation) my parents struggle more each day.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I tried starting my own Amazon(arbitrage) business. Retail arbitrage was a bust, so I went with FBA, only to learn that the market was too overly saturated with competition, and the seller fees made it nearly impossible to earn a profit(not to mention too many item category restrictions.) I tried dozens of online programs, videos, and tips to make it work, but to no avail. I put two years of hard work into Amazon, trying to create my own private-label brand with no success. Again, oversaturation. This venture cost me thousands of dollars with zero ROI.

Next, I tried flipping used valuable items on eBay, Mercari, and finally, Facebook marketplace for over a year by wasting hundreds of dollars on items and ads only to have a few sales a month. Mercari is a total bust, with current listings sitting on their site for over a year. I've made a few sales on eBay, but more people are on the E-commerce bandwagon more than ever. Compared to ten years ago, more sellers in today's market have really upped the competition. Most sales on eBay or Facebook marketplace consist of buyers throwing lowball offers at me-eg. A good-quality jacket listed for $150 is determined by comparing prices with other sellers or apps. A potential buyer comes at me with an offer saying, ""Will you take $25 for it instead?""

My last-ditched attempt at selling anything online was drop shipping. I put a lot of time and energy into drop shipping while I was simultaneously learning Amazon and then eBay arbitrage. I watched tons of YouTube videos on this and sought out the best marketing strategies, only to lose even more money.

Since I am unable to sell anything online, are there any other possible job opportunities out there that are not over-saturated? Maybe I can't run my own business at home, but are there any online opportunities that offer remote work with decent pay and don't require big college degrees? Is there anything online or at home that does not involve e-commerce? Any ideas would be really helpful.

It will just be me in my studio apartment. Outside of working, I play video games and watch YouTube on my phone.

I've decided to get a Verizon Visible+ plan and dedicate its data towards work. I also have a TP-Link router with an Ethernet port and 4G/5G dongle to help get all of the speed I can out of my plan. 

I'm currently residing in a place with legitimate home Internet (Cox), but neither of my WFH jobs required a speed test report. One of them even gave me a rig that required a Wi-Fi dongle.

If I swap from Cox Wi-Fi setup to a Mobile Hotspot setup, will the companies notice anything on their end? It's not necessarily ""against the rules"" to be on a hotspot, but I hear it's frowned upon. So, I'd like to conceal that if possible.

I don't mind the hybrid schedule, but I plan to move to another province next year and I want to negotiate remote work with my manager. Our team is small and everyone works hybrid. I am worried that if I ask for relocation I would lose this job because I am the only remote member in the team.

We do have members working remotely, but they do so as a whole team, and there are also some sales people who work remote. They have good track records and have been with the company for a few years.

Is my worry unnecessary? I am afraid that if I bring up the topic to my manager and they are not happy about it, it will be awkward moving forward. Another thing I can do is looking for another job as a back up and only bring up the topic if I am very close to a job offer, so that if the negotiation fails I still have another job.

1b88flv,Seeking advice on the best remote work setup for my situation,"Hello! I'm in need of some advice on upgrading my home workspace situation.

Recently, my boyfriend (34M) and I (28F) moved in together into a three-room apartment: our bedroom, a spacious room with natural light, and a smaller room without any natural light.

Since my boyfriend is self-employed and works from home full-time, he set up his own workspace in the room with natural light, with a standing desk, monitor, and office chair. Meanwhile, I've been making do with the dining room table in our living room, because I used to have a hybrid work situation and could go to an actual office.

But now I've transitioned to a fully remote position, and I need a more suitable workspace, with an office chair and a monitor. Whenever I use my boyfriend's office desk with a monitor when he's away, I find that I am way more productive, so I need to find a solution.

I've brainstormed three potential options, each with its own set of pros and cons, and I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. **Living room setup:** Squeeze a small office desk and chair in the living room. This allows me to have a separate workspace, use a monitor and office chair, and still benefit from some natural light. However, the living room will feel very cluttered. It's an open-concept living room so it would be in the same space as the kitchen and TV.
2. **Small room conversion:** Transform the small room with no natural light (currently used for storage) into my office. While it provides a dedicated space, I'm worried that working 8+ hours a day in a cave with no natural light might impact my mood and circadian rhythm. My boyfriend actually tried to work from there once and hated it.
3. **Shared office space:** Set up a desk next to my boyfriend's in his office. The positives include having a separate office space, enjoying natural light, and keeping the rest of the apartment uncluttered. On the flip side, I'm unsure about working in the same room as my boyfriend. He doesn't have meetings, but he he doesn't like to use headphones so he plays audio often on speaker or does stretches in the middle of the room 

Important note: Adding a workspace to our bedroom impossible because there's no room, and it's also a room with no natural light.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or personal experience working from home with a partner that also works from home.

193wnkf,Seeking advice: finding a remote native iOS job from Thailand,"In the face of the current layoff trends, the emergence of AI, and the shift back to office-centric work, I'm hoping to find guidance in this community. Is it possible to find a remote native iOS development job while based in Thailand? Additionally, how do I go about finding companies or projects that are open to having a developer located in this region? I understand the stereotype that developers in Thailand might lean towards a 'sabai-sabai' lifestyle, focusing more on leisure than work.

Here's a bit about my background, which might be helpful for specific advice:

1. **Experience**: With 11 years of expertise in native iOS development, hope I am well beyond a junior level (of course in some companies as FAANG I would be a junior level).
2. **Citizenship**: Ukrainian. Not seeking empathy, but rather providing context as I am not from the typically represented demographics on Reddit such as the U.S., Canada, or Australia. Due to the terrible situation in Ukraine and the poor state of the IT labor market (30-50 iOS positions including all levels in Ukraine), working in my home country is not possible. Additionally, my professional network hasn't been particularly helpful.
3. **Previous Remote Work**: My past experience includes direct remote work for a U.S. company before COVID. Unfortunately, this ended due to my location in Ukraine and my inability to leave country at that time when full scale war started.

I'm looking for advice on:

1. Are there realistic opportunities for remote iOS development roles while residing in Thailand?
2. Which companies should I consider approaching, perhaps those in Australia for time zone compatibility? What platforms or communities could be instrumental in my search? A friend of mine works with customers from Australia, they do not care about his location and even OK to pay salary in crypto, but they do not need mobile.
3. Are there any expatriate developer communities in Thailand that might offer advice or assistance?
4. Any specific tips for finding mobile development roles? I've observed that opportunities in mobile development are predominantly found in the United States, with some presence in European countries like Germany and Spain.

I'm also aware that even in the U.S., the job market is challenging now, even for FAANG developers with green cards/passport who have more experience than I do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/193wnkf/seeking_advice_finding_a_remote_native_ios_job/,1704960794.0,0,0,remotework

Only few major ones stands out, through organizations that either empowers platforms or constantly provides job offers that can actually impact lives, including freelance jobs, Social Mining jobs, LinkedIn posts and Remote co.

On top of that, I was the only one in my team and the teams we frequently worked with that was based in my country, so I felt like she was just making things difficult for me. I also moved to another city during covid and worked for that same company for 2 years, fully remotely with no issues - my previous manager knew about this and was totally ok with this and that was a big reason for my move.

One of my good friends had told me about her work from home job at an up and coming real estate company. She said it was one of the best jobs she had ever had. I thought it was too good to be true. She invited me to observe her as she showed me what she did in a day. I immediately wanted the job.

Fast forward about 6 months later and applying at this company 3 times, I had finally landed the job! It took networking, persistently reaching out to recruiters and managers, applying to many positions, etc. but I finally got my foot in the door. I had to work through my insecurities and self doubt every time I got rejected but I couldn't give up. This is what I wanted.

Now 2 years later I am enjoying my life beyond what I could imagine. I genuinely love the work I do, I have more free time for myself and others, and I have more free time to invest into others and help them make their work from home dreams a reality.

If finding a remote job is your dream I have advice for you:

Don't give up
Keep learning new skills and update your resume constantly
Network and make real connections

y0e5g6,Started new remote job but already being asked to go to the office?? How to navigate?,"So I applied to a remote position that had no info re: being in office or travel. Had three interviews and no mention of being in office or travel. I received my offer which states I'm a remote employee and for reporting purposes only roles up to X office which is several states away from my home and is a 90 mile, 2.5-3 hr drive one way away.

On my fourth day I was told I needed to go to the office for ""face time"" with a SVP who was stopping in. I felt like it was being told and not asked of me so I went.. left my house at 6:20am got there 9:20am and stayed all day and for a dinner after. Didn't hit the road until 8:30pm and didn't get home until 10:30pm. I was falling asleep at the wheel.

Next day my boss asked me how it was and that there's a lunch the following Wed I should go to. This is where I decide to align expectations. I shared that I didn't feel safe making a 5+ hr round trip to the office and thatI applied to a remote role, my offer says I'm remote and we never discussed any requirement re: being in office. He asks me if I can go in 10%. I ask what does that mean exactly and he says every 6-8 weeks. I said no I can't commit to that. I can do once a quarter and will require a company paid hotel. We settled on this and I have it in writing.

This whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I shared that if the job description or in any of my interviews noted a requirement to be at the office at any given time it would have impacted my decision. I'm new and want to be a good team member but I also want to set boundaries based on what was agreed upon when I applied and accepted.

There's a lunch this Wed and it's now ""optional"" but I'm making myself crazy over if I should go or not. I feel like if I go they will keep asking to go in but if I stand my ground then I'm enforcing the boundary and expectations.

What are your thoughts on the situation? Am I right to be turned off by this? Do I now have a target on my back? Do I move on and follow the boundary I set and not think about it because it's settled?

PS - He also said traveling in should be easy because I don't have kids... major red flag and documented.

Edit:
Didn't go to the ""optional"" lunch and boss seemed to be fine with it. I have feelers out just in case as back up, but hoping this is all going to be a nonissue. I've already received great feedback from him and the team on how I'm doing so I think if I stay the course I'll be as ""ok"" as one can be at any job in the US :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/y0e5g6/started_new_remote_job_but_already_being_asked_to/,1665406673.0,46,62,remotework

18f7u54,Potentially losing my remote job," 

I am working in a Remote role as a manager in FP&A. The president sent an email offering voluntary severance opportunities before involuntary layoffs happen. Most likely January is when the involuntary layoffs happen. It seems like they are going to slash jobs across the board just because we didn't attract enough income this year and we grew too fast. We found out that my department alone could face up to 20-30% cuts soon enough.

This job even while being 100% Remote has been exceptionally stressful and it's taken a mental and physical toll on me. A lot of others I work with have also been feeling this stress and overcapacity. Potentially getting laid off might feel like a big stress has been lifted but then I am stressing about losing a 100% remote job.

I have been constantly applying for jobs and have been doing so the past few months but I have not getting any hits so far except 1 interview for a hybrid (very high COL) position.

1aiozlo,Work Burnout (Remote Tech Recruiter/Sales Development),"I recently took a contract position in my field. It was a huge mistake I will never make again. I could only bill for 40 hours, but I worked 75. The pay was good, and it was fully remote. Shit contract, though. 

I took the position to escape a horrible boss, under which I was a permanent employee. Silent, in person office (enforced by constant monitoring), lots of public screaming at top employees no matter their numbers (I was a top performer and his main target). People literally quit over my treatment that they themselves never received. It was that bad. 

Working at home, over a 3 month period, I feel like I've fried my circuitry. Like my cortisol level is at 11 and now I can't dial it down. I can't sleep. After a week of ""rest"", I can barely look at a computer screen and I still feel fucking nuts. 

It's getting better, but at a snail's pace. Is this from working at home? Did I leave myself no escape from work? Is it my inability to read prospective bosses as I read prospective candidates? 

Is this common to anyone else? Lastly, what can I do to just feel normal (WTF that means, lol). I don't mind the hours, but I've never experienced this feeling working anywhere else.

umu2t2,"How can I find a better paying remote, work from home, job with my skills?","Here's the thing, I don't really have many - and that's the main problem. 

I started remote work answering calls for $9/hour for infomercials and random inbound calls for data breaches with people inquiring about signing up for credit monitoring. I absolutely hated it. 8 hour shifts with elderly mostly calling who had no technical experience or people mad they were getting a letter in the mail for something they had no idea what it was. 

I changed jobs a little over 2 years ago to dispatching and casework for another company and I've been pretty successful there. Granted it's a 1099 position. I always get props for my high QM scores but never really get anything for it. Currently I make $14/hour BUT everyone's hours were recently reduced to 30 hours, in my case, or 25 hours, in lower tier agent's case, a week. It's NOT sustainable. I've ran through my savings to cover bills, all while management keeps dangling a carrot over our heads saying 'hours should pick up soon'.

I *need* something better. 

The issue is, I can't seem to find anything. It's all either scams, or I get rejected or I just do not hear anything back - OR just something happens and my interview all the sudden doesn't exist, which has happened twice now by different companies. 

I did test the water at a start up company but their structure was so terrible that I quit within 3 days because they weren't training me, even though I was asking almost hourly for more training material or sessions. That was a terrible experience because I had to miss my current job for a few days to actually do this one because they didn't read I needed a few days to start so I could fix my schedule. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Remote work is my only option due to medical issues, immune system can't handle a normal job. 

I've dressed my resume up so much, went over it with a professional back in June last year and they agreed that it was great, even went back with a different person and they agreed but changed a few details. All-in-all I don't think it's my resume that's the problem.

1b9ysis,"Already 100% remote, trying to convince my job to let me move out of state.","I currently work full-time for a large company in California with bases all over the state. I have wanted to move to Oregon for years, but things have always gotten in the way. I am finally finding myself completely capable of moving out there, the only issue is my job. I adore my job, I am 100% remote, am great at what i do, do something that is expensive for the company to replace, and my boss is fully supportive of trying to get me where I would be happiest.

Unfortunately, my companies handbook states no out of state employees, presumably for labor law/tax conflicts. I will admit, I am not fully aware of how this request would *truly* impact HR. I am in finance and work on a lot of payroll, but I don't see THAT side of things. I have read a ton about the implications it can cause a business, but I have also met so many people (not from my company) that work without a pre existing base out of that state, so I am not positive on how it all works.

I have read about some people successfully convincing their company to let them move, since the other state has less intense labor laws (which would be the same in my case since I am coming FROM California) OR convincing their company to re-hire them through a staffing agency based in the state they're moving to. Obviously there are implications with that and it still requires work for HR, but it is worth noting my company already uses a specific staffing agency (which operates all around the US, not just California) to hire people all of the time. If you have any ideas or experience about this though, I'd love to hear.

I have not directly asked HR yet, so my question(s) is basically if you had experience in this, how did it go? OR if you understand more of the complexities of how this impacts HR, I'd love to learn so that I can draft a thorough appeal to them. I have a million ""emotional"" reasons to convince them, but I know that is far from important to a business, so I really want to meet them where they're at to hopefully elicit a better response. I am honestly desperate to move, but with the current job market and truly loving my job, leaving is not something I want to even think about right now.

15a3gha,How to combat the loneliness of remote work,"Working from home has its perks, no doubt. No commute, flexible hours, and the freedom to work in your PJs. But let's face it, it can also get pretty lonely. The lack of face-to-face interaction can sometimes make us feel isolated. So, how do we combat this loneliness? Here are some tried-and-true strategies:

**1. Daily 20-Minute Team Meetings**

Start your day with a quick 20-minute team meeting. This isn't for discussing work-related issues, but rather a chance to share what you're planning to do for the day, any interesting news, or even what you had for breakfast! It's a great way to maintain a sense of camaraderie and keep the team spirit alive.

**2. Connect with Peers**

Find a couple of people in similar roles and set up monthly meetings with them. This can be a great way to share experiences, discuss challenges, and learn from each other. Plus, it's always nice to connect with people who ""get"" what you're going through.

**3. Get a Coach**

Consider getting a coach to help you navigate the challenges of remote work. A coach can provide guidance, support, and a listening ear when things get tough. Apps like **wave.ai** offer coaching services tailored to your needs. They can also help you with things like salary negotiation or career crossovers.

**4. Weekly Game Session**

Organize a weekly 30-minute game session with your team. This could be anything from online games like **Garticphone** or **Kahoot**, to virtual yoga sessions, or even a cooking challenge. It's a fun way to break the monotony and foster team bonding.

**5. Create a Cozy Workspace**

Make your workspace a place you love. Add some plants, pictures, or anything that makes you happy. A cozy workspace can make your workday more enjoyable and less lonely.

**6. Take Regular Breaks**

Don't forget to take regular breaks. Step away from your desk, make a cup of tea, or take a short walk. It's important for your mental health and can make your workday feel less isolating.

**7. Stay Active **

Exercise is a great mood booster. Try to incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine. It could be a morning jog, a midday yoga session, or an evening dance party in your living room!

It's normal to feel lonely when working remotely. But with these strategies, you can combat the loneliness and make your work-from-home experience a positive one.

18xgv0m,Moving to Italy: how to propose remote work to my employer,"Dear Remote Workers, 

I am an Italian expat living in another European country since almost 7 years now, and my girlfriend and I have made the decision to move back to Italy. 
My girlfriend is already fully remote, and can work from everywhere in the world.

Before I explain my situation further I would like to say this: my employer currently has employees working remotely from Italy, France, Romania and other countries around the world. The only people not allowed to work remotely are the ones living close to a city where they do actually have an office, and this is the situation I'm currently in. Absolutely stupid. Anyway, back to the story. 

We have decided to move back to Italy simply because I don't like it here and I am not happy. Weather sucks, my social life sucks, and everything is very expensive. Notice I say ""I"" as my girlfriend is ok staying here where we are, but she's absolutely down with moving to Italy. 

Our decision is a non negotiable, meaning we are going to move even if my employer says no. I just need to find a remote job and it might take some more time. However the simplest route would be having my employer agreeing with me working from Italy.

I would kindly need some advice from you on how to approach this with my manager, and then eventually with HR. My job can be done completely remotely, so no issues on that front. 

Do I give my manager/employer an ultimatum, saying I am moving back to Italy no matter what? Or do I ask nicely? I'm of the opinion that forcing their hand will give me more results, but I might be wrong. 

What are some things I can say to them to help my case? How can I best prepare for the meeting, and how should I schedule the meeting?

* Interviewer expressed some degree of flexibility but I didn't try to dig deeper into the subject as it was my first interview. I mentioned however, that'd I'd love to be based in Portugal. This being said, I have also moved on to the next round of interviews 

* The company has offices in Luxembourg, Paris and London

* I have spoken to a friend that's using Remote.com to work for a Swedish company while working in Portugal and works great. He pays taxes in Portugal accordingly. Would this work with Luxembourg-Portugal?

* What other options are there? I don't really understand the being hired as a ""contractor"" or ""external consultant"" concepts (i.e. independent worker by establishing a company in Portugal). 

Happy to get insights on this!

18c5ond,Health issues leading me to remote work,"About six months ago I got my first full-time job and I was so excited. It was definitely a step up from my last job, which was contract work and underpaid. I love my new job and I was so happy. However, a few months in I started having severe GERD, irregular and painful bowel movements, etc etc (don't wanna gross y'all out too much). Ended up finding I have esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and a hiatal hernia. Medications I've been taking do not help and my stomach seems to reject any food I eat, so I'm still on my GI journey. I have a very physically demanding job working 1:1 with children on the spectrum, can't take bathroom breaks when I need, and lots of movement makes me very nauseous. I used up my PTO before I realized I qualified for FMLA, and since then my health continues to decline and I have been out more and more. Of course, FMLA is supposed to protect me, but I know that in my state I cannot continue to work there and plan to leave at the end of the year bc I feel I'm a burden to them as I am. So until then, I am looking for remote work that will allow me to take care of my health needs while I work from home. Since I have been an RBT/ behavioral technician for many years, I feel a job around data or even just writing would fit me well. If anyone has suggestions on here, that would be much appreciated.

TLDR: My health is barring me from successfully being able to do my job, so I plan to change to remote work bc of the severity and need help/direction as I have never worked remote.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/18c5ond/health_issues_leading_me_to_remote_work/,1701874504.0,3,1,remotework

wj7t03,Working fully remote: take away from my first 5 months,"On April 1st, I started my first fully remote job, and I thought to share some tips that helped me adapt quickly and be productive. I hope someone who wishes to work fully remotely will find this post helpful.

**Build a routine & dress up**

For years, my routine revolved around commuting to the office. It was easier to stick to it because of external ""urgency."" Now, I have to make a conscious effort to maintain my own work-at-home routine. I am glad I'm doing it, as it gives rhythm to my day and helps me get started at work.

Here's my daily routine: waking up - drinking a glass of water - exercising - meditating - having breakfast - showering - dressing up, and getting started at work.

Dressing up gives me a demeanor and a sense of professionalism which I appreciate.

**Ergonomic chair and standing desk**

When I started my new job, I was concerned about my posture and ergonomics. So I invested in a good chair and standing desk (as those things tend to be expensive, ask your company to help you with the purchase). I placed the desk close to a window to have some natural light. When I am done with work, I try to leave my desk neat and clear for the next day.

**Have a work-at-home journal**

As I was concerned about my well-being, I kept a work-at-home journal for a while. In the morning, I wrote my concerns, wishes, and intentions for the day; I would reflect on the day when closing work. The journal helped me to channel my thoughts, dump my worries, and address issues at work more calmly.

**Be aware of loneliness**

Working from home all day in a foreign city could be alienating (I am an Italian living in The Netherlands). I started feeling very lonely during my work days, so I made a list of activities to defeat loneliness:

* Plan virtual coffees with my colleagues
* Go to a co-working/coffee place to work
* Have a lunch break with a friend
* Plan after-work activities with other people (Meet-ups are a great solution)
* Invite a friend to work at your place
* Offer your neighbor to do pet sitting

**Make the best out of your breaks**

I usually chatted with a colleague at the office or headed to the coffee machine. At home, my breaks are a bit different. I want to stay away from my phone, so I list some nice things I could do during breaks.

* stretch, drink water, look at the distance
* do small house chores
* water and vaporize the plants
* pet the pet :)
* lay down and read 5 minutes
* do squats and abs
* Prepare a tea or a coffee
* walk outside
* play the guitar

**Stay focused and productive: plan, track and manage time**

When I am alone at my desk, it could be tempting to have distractions and mess around with social media, youtube, and news. I like to plan my week and adjust my next day's agenda the evening before. I do time boxing in my Google calendar, then track how I spend time with the Timeular app (also because I work there).

Planning ahead, tracking time, and then comparing the arranged time with the actual work done was a panacea for my productivity. I've noticed that I was taking too long breaks, and the house chores were distracting me, so I started setting a timer whenever I took a break/start a house chore.

Plus, I've noticed that I tend to work more hours on Wednesdays than needed, so I started planning after-work activities away from my keyboard for that day.

**Travel and enjoy remote working**

When I started the new job, I did not want to mess up with time zones, distractions, and impediments that come with travel. But now that I am more confident with the role, I'll give myself permission to travel more, working from places I have wanted to visit for a long time like Barcelona, Turin, and Mallorca.

Overall, remote work is great for me as long as I don't feel too lonely. The benefits I've experienced with remote work are work and private life in balance, more time for myself in the morning, no stress commuting, improved productivity, and traveling experiences :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/wj7t03/working_fully_remote_take_away_from_my_first_5/,1659962214.0,16,48,remotework

16z4a2t,Is my remote job that pays $30 an hour (25 hour work week) enough to survive in Thailand,"I recently landed a remote live assistant role via a remote job listing website called Mychatjob.com that promises a steady $30 an hour for a 25-hour workweek. The opportunity came at the perfect time, as I've been contemplating a move to Thailand to concentrate on my budding online business.

With the pull of Thailand's lower living costs and vibrant culture, I'm eager to understand the practicalities. Can an income of roughly $750 a week from this role comfortably cover the bare necessities there? My aim isn't luxury; I just want a stable environment to propel my online venture forward without financial distress lurking in the shadows.

1) the company I received an offer from is in a time zone 2 hours away.  They seem flexible to the hours I work, though overtime is required certain times of the year.

2) would you still find remote work beneficial if it increased your commute time?  I have 2 little kids in a daycare we love, but it is located near my office.  I would have to take them and pick them up every day (about 40 minutes driving, 60 minutes total round trip).  Our son has 1.5 years before school which would be closer to our house.  At that time I'd consider switching our daughter to a closer daycare/pre school.

For reference, the pay is ~10% more than my current role but does require more overtime so about the same hourly.  My current job is in office 5 days a week full professional dress.  I find this exhausting.

1bfmej6,I work in remote sales as a closer (My story with it + Q&A),"Howdy everyone! I wanted to share my experience with remote sales because it massively changed my life for the better and figured I'd share my experience as well as tips if this is something you're looking to consider as a remote job.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Before I Started**

Before I started working from home in sales, I worked for t-mobile for 3 years, and before that I worked with Sprint for 2 years before they merged into t-mobile. I had at that point 100% customer service experience, making 2.6k/m after tax + benefits. Honestly thought I was going to retire there. 2022 came around and t-mobile made a lot of changes that actually ended up hurting my bonuses I'd normally get from selling phones and adding lines. Dropped as low as 1.9k/m. To me, at that time, was was a big pay drop. A close friend of mine, got even more screwed with those changes. He went from making 3.3k/m down to 2.1k/m after the changes. It was rough but honestly, was prepared to keep working there. My friend, however, did not.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**How I Started**

My friend took all his PTO and took 4 weeks off. He hit me up 2 weeks after he ""left"" saying he got a job as a remote closer. After he received his first paycheck, which was around 10k, he quit t-mobile at the drop of a hat. He went through a program he paid 10k for to get training, interviews, and placements. Worked for him because he was also a retired cop so he had money to put into something like that, I didn't. So shopping around, I ran into a program called **7 Figure Sales Academy,** I booked a call with them, told them I had someone doing this thing making good money, but could not afford the 10k for everything (NOTE: This is not the company my friend went with). They set me up with 3 monthly payments of **1k** for a total of **3k** for just training. I talked with my misses, and decided it was worth it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Starting the Process**

So the training was great, learned a lot of sales skills, met some really nice people during group training sessions, was pumped to try out being a salesman after I finished the course in 4 weeks! **HOWEVER,** I struggled to get jobs. Some of them on linkedin were scams, some of them wanted me to already have closing experience, and just 2 months of no responses. I felt like no one wanted a guy with 0 sales experience, even if I had training.

My friend, who was consistently making 14k/m at his remote job, told me to give the company he went through a shot. Now I was 3k in the hole with nothing to show for it but seeing his success, I felt like I might as well since I already got this far. Reached out to the company he worked with \[**Elite Closers**\], agreed to pay **1k down, 500/m until I paid off 9.8k total.** I was able to get the vetting/training done in 4 weeks, and after that I was able to do my first interview on my 5th week. I was hired the following Monday! Now at that point I was **4.5k invested,** nothing to show for it but powered through.

I was placed with a company called **Michael Blank,** who does multi-family real estate syndication/masterminds. First month, made 7k but hell yea, 3x better than what I was making before. I quit my job at t-mobile, went full time my second month with them, made 14.2k my second month, and paid off everything I owed to Elite Closers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Now**

a year and 3 months later, I'm making 23k/m on average with my current offer. I'm no longer working for Michael Blank but 3 months ago, a lead generation company reached out to me through my coach at Elite Closers, and offered me higher commission so I took it. I only take, maybe 29 calls a week (I work 40 hours, each call being 1 hour long, but some people don't show or cancel). People book around my schedule and I can work anywhere I want. I've even taken sales calls on a lake while fishing. I'm so comfortable here and it's something I never thought I'd be doing, let alone from home.

**Things you should know/Tips**

As far as remote is concerned, this is easy work, you're taking calls at home or where-ever you want, people are booking around your schedule, and as long as you're performing, there's no such thing as PTO, time off, sick leave, or vacation time. However, for this to work, the sales aspect is difficult, at least to me. **Here's some things, from my experience, you should know before considering this:**

* This is **NOT** for everyone. High ticket sales without experience or training, can be incredibly difficult. Sure, the $$$ is there, but if it's not something you 100% want to make a career out of and you don't have that ""sales grind"" mindset, this will be a very uphill battle. Especially if you want to do Business to Business sales like I'm doing now, it's a slog to get through, but it pays well.
* Without direct referrals, prior remote sales experience, or a service/agency to vouch for you, getting into remote closing high-ticket sales is damn near impossible. You're fighting for **a remote position**, which everyone wants, for **decent pay**, which everyone wants, **in sales**, which a lot of people already have the skills to do. That might be different from person to person, but I needed to pay for job placements and security through Elite Closers. Without them, I felt like there was nothing I could do.
* You can apply for jobs through Linkedin (I just typed in 'Remote Closer' in the search bar, and a lot of jobs pulled up) or even Indeed, but there are some offers that are scams. On top of that, unless you do your research, the commission they offer, might not actually be what they pay out. So if you do look for these jobs, definitely pull up research on the company before pulling the trigger with them.
* It's 100% remote so there's no hybrid, it's 100% commission base unless you find a company that's willing to offer salary, and it's still technically a part time/full time job. If all 3 of those things work for you, you'll be fine.

If you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask below! **Keep the comments civil!!!** I know some people feel strongly against sales or even the way I went about getting a remote sales job, but it worked for me. I want to help clear up some confusion about this topic and help people make a more educated decision on if remote sales or going through an agency like I did, is worth it for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1bfmej6/i_work_in_remote_sales_as_a_closer_my_story_with/,1710531329.0,9,1,remotework
143o81s,Laid off from NY remote job--which state do I file for unemployment?,"I was recently laid off from my company, which is based in NY. I live in a southern state, and have been remote since I started  the company. I applied for NY unemployment, but I am concerned that my claim may get rejected since I'm not a NY resident. Does anyone have any experience with NY unemployment as an out-of-state resident?

Edit: I called the unemployment office in my state and they said it makes more sense for me to file in NY. They said they have no record of my wages on file.

Edit 2: The unemployment office in NY says that my company stopped reporting my wages back in early
2022 for whatever reason. They're kind of a shady company so I'm suspecting tax fraud. Really hoping this doesn't delay anything, but at least I'm applying in the right state.

Edit 3: Okay, I was approved for NY! Weirdly enough, my HR told me to apply for unemployment in my current state. But after submitting paystubs, NY approved my claim and I am due to get payments starting next week. I was so afraid I'd be in UE purgatory for months.

15bx5nr,Missing remote work culture,"I've been at the same company that I adore for over two years and worked remotely the whole time. About a month ago I changed roles and departments and have found that I'm really struggling with remote work isolation.

I went from having a large engaging remote team (from casual conversations to work conversations) to now being just a dynamic duo with my leader. 

I've tried creating group chats with my coworkers I would consider friends but it's pretty much run dry considering they still have the support and culture I used to have in my old role.

Don't get me wrong I LOVE my new job, love my new boss, I do love working remotely, and am excited to be in this position. But the isolation and sudden lack of work culture is shocking me and hitting me hard since I didn't experience it before even while remote.

18d8r0b,Masters or not? What I really want is a remote job," 

Female engineer- I have an opportunity to get a masters in systems engineering online from a good university through my company (F500). It would be a one year full time program and I would get my full salary at the same time, school would be paid for, and I would not be expected to work while getting the masters. For most people, this would probably be a dream come true no brainer. I would also be required to sign a contract saying that I would stay with the company for two years after the masters or pay back the $35/40k on a sliding scale (ie, if I left after 1 year I would only have to pay half back, 1.5 years pay a quarter back etc). 

There are a few reasons I am hesitating. I would really love to have a remote job, and my company is firmly dedicated to being in person. I also want to start a family in the next two years which would mean I would have to use day care or a nanny. Ideally I would like to either be a stay at home mom or work remotely at home while having a nanny at the same time. Is it possible to request WFM while pregnant and while breastfeeding at companies that are mainly in office? Is it worth the risk of that not being approved?

Also, engineering isn't my passion. I am smart and hard working and wanted a job with stability, so ended up majoring in ME and this job is the best offer I got after graduating. I am finding even with my 3 plus years of experience it's very difficult to find a remote job right now. I'm looking for positions like product manager, project manager, etc. I don't love my job currently. It's fine, my boss really likes me, and I can occasionally work from home, but sometimes people notice. 

I'm on a bit of a deadline as the masters program starts early January. I could withdraw, but I need to confirm at what point the money gets paid and when I would be responsible for paying money back. If I choose to not get the masters, the director is holding a spot for me on the team to stay, but currently they are planning to replace me for the 1 year I am getting my masters so they also need to know. If I don't get the masters, it would give me more time to look for a job, but I just am so tired of this job, that the masters is also appealing just for a change of pace, remote work now for one year, etc. 

I am worried about locking myself into a 2 year contract at a company and job that I don't love. Maybe if I get back from the masters and work 9 months, take 3 months paid plus 3 months unpaid leave, then work 9 months while breastfeeding that's a short enough stretch I could suffer through it. If I absolutely knew I would get approval to work remotely I would do that without question. But it's hard to ask my boss or HR, hey in a year from now when I think I'll be pregnant can I work remotely? Is it worth staying now and trying to find a job I really like that is remote? Those are just so hard to find- both options seem like a gamble.

x2q4zu,Remote work blues and handling office politics,"During the pandemic, I job-hopped more than ever and was hired/onboarded completely remote. I ended up at a company that I really like and support, but my immediate team is really odd. 

My boss is a consultant (not a permanent employee) and she has a lot of bad qualities. In addition to being an extreme micromanager, she has other weird quirks - for instance, she focuses on my emails and how they are too long. She also says I'm not allowed to email anyone unless she signs off on it. Today, we had a project that the CEO asked for and I made the corrections (that she asked me to do), then I sent it back to him because it was time sensitive. She is in a different time zone, but immediately sent back a response (around midnight her time) that I was not allowed to send communications to the CEO without her permission. But ... others in my company do all the time! I talked to one executive who said our CEO would be happy to book time with me to chat. 

My other manager started at this company as an intern and his only work experience is here, but he's not the most helpful person. Often times he tells us wrong information and his attention to detail is lacking. For instance, he is on holiday this week and wouldn't set aside any time to prep me on how to handle certain responsibilities while he was away. He also works hybrid and constantly tells me remote isn't the same, that there is too much room for miscommunication ... but he's kind of a terrible communicator. 

They seem so terrified and there are so many rules. The first boss says things like I shouldn't tell people what we're working on in our department. She constantly rewrites my assignments, but she adds in the wrong details so other departments come back and say we're wrong. She's been in trouble a lot lately and I noticed her interpretation of what happens at work is not true. Like she kept telling us how we need a website developer and we were going to hire one. By how she made it sound, this was certain. Well, the CEO told her no they were not doing that and he chastised her in front of everyone. 

How do I handle a situation like this? It makes me concerned about the stability of my job. She doesn't allow me to connect with others (even on our own team). But still I am a permanent employee and I am being given lots of responsibility. What do you make of it?

17qmpir,I found a remote job in 2 months using a 3-stage preparation process and some AI tools and,"I was laid off a few months ago. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single related job offer but I didn't even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used and it worked for me. I also used a few tools that ended up being very useful.

After 2 months of using that preparation system, I was offered 3 positions! 2 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company.

I learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on ""Mastering that stage only"" and improving on 1 metric:

**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume** **(metric: Conversion rate from CV sent to first interview scheduled):**

My main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to f*irst interview scheduled*).

I did this:

* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).
* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don't find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.
* Create a cover letter ""template"" and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company
* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a ""Website URL"" (asked in many offers)

Once I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.

**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR) (metric: Conversion rate to second interview with manager)**

In this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.

You'll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with ""Hard Questions in Job Interviews"" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen 

**3 Use case (or technical exercise) (Metric: Job offers received)**

My metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance.  


Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process:

**1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer**

You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt

>As ChatGPT, you'll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \_\_\_\_. I'll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you'll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond.  
 

Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt

>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume.  
 

Then ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.

**2 kickresume**

Use it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven't tried it yet but it looks promising.

**3 Wave Coaching**

It provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I'm so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me.

**4 Otter or tldv**

You can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand!

**5 Interview Warmup (from Google)**

Similar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.

I hope this is helpful to you!

19fig7v,Pros and cons of remote work- library/publishing fields,"Hi everyone,

I've been in public libraries off and on for over 10 years. I enjoy it a lot, because I like helping people and working with the public. But my partner is the early stages of a career in academia and will probably have to move multiple times in coming years. So I'm looking to obtain a remote job in libraries, archives, library vendors, or publishing. I don't *have* to find a new job until summer 2025, but I may want to go ahead and transition now.

If you transitioned from in person to remote work, especially if you are in a similar field, what do you see as the pros and cons of your decision? I made a table (lol, I know) with my own ideas, are there any other points you would add to either column?



|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|-get a new start, no bad reputation- get my dignity back|have to meet all new coworkers and boss|
|-get to learn a new industry or at least skills|-want to transition back to libraries eventually|
|-probably busier, less boring|-probably much less downtime to read in|
|-getting ready in the AM/being on time easier, no commute|-harder to get going if I'm still at home, harder for partner to leave the house|
|-less contact=don't have to socialize when I don't want to|-might get lonely|
|-easier to do quick things house tasks like cleaning|-may be tempted to leave computer too often for these things|
|-no FMLA/wanting to impress new boss may help w/absences|-no FMLA for a year|
|-now we'll have a hotspot whenever internet goes down|-internet not always reliable, have to pay for hotspot (price?)|
|-possibly better pay|-possibly worse pay, but I won't go lower than $20-21 ($23 right now)|
|-this will have to happen in 1.5 years anyway, could get it done early to avoid stress at that time when partner will also have lots of stress|-applying for jobs is both tedious/lots of work and emotional if I get rejected|

Few things. I have health problems and have had issues with attendance. I'm covered by FMLA, but unfortunately I now have a bad reputation among some of my coworkers. I have so much anxiety about this, that I feel taking a new job would help me restore my dignity and improve my mental health. However, I won't be eligible for FMLA for a whole year if I start a new job.

Another consideration is that my current job has a LOT of downtime in which I get to read the news or an ebook. I'm so used to this that I worry a remote job is likely to have stringent ways to check if you're working, and that it'll be hard to adjust to a solid 8 hours of real work.

Lastly, I have a very limited social life. No friends really, but I do have a partner I've known for half a lifetime, as well as a big loving extended family. My coworkers are the only people I interact with otherwise, and though we aren't friends (it's not like we ever see each other outside of work) I don't want to grow too isolated. I'm a hermit and I don't feel lonely right now, but I don't want it to worsen.

Thanks in advance for your help! I truly appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/19fig7v/pros_and_cons_of_remote_work_librarypublishing/,1706213194.0,0,1,remotework

I've been applying to jobs and feeling very discouraged trying to sift through the BS to find something actually remote or not an MLM. I trained search engines with Telus throughout college but my contract ended so I was let go. I have media analytics skills from that. I also have research skills from my time in college but lack the experience a lot of places are looking for since I just graduated.

Ideally I'm looking for something full-time, flexible hours preferred but I assume that's a pipe dream so not a requirement. $30kish+ is fine. I'm honestly open to most opportunities besides phone-based customer service/sales. Also, I live in the midwest.

I am not sure if I want to divert too much away from my timezone, where rest of my team is based (GMT +2, Riga, Latvia), as well as, this is yet a wild thought in my head, because I haven't spoken to my HR, CTO and Leads.

Another redditor recently suggested, given my background, to look for remote tech sales jobs. I have over 20 years experience in both IT and sales positions, as well as tech sales and managing sales teams.

I may have to part ways soon with the company I helped start, for various reasons that aren't all so bad. It would be a mutual agreement, not be fired. Mainly I have branched out into working with an NGO and my company has turned from shaky to a rapidly sinking ship after ownership changes.

Currently located in South Africa for a bit, but from NYC. Obviously I'd *prefer* a US based company that would allow this remote work, for the pay. I have a strong lead with a UAE based company with ops in the US, but they'd want me back there after speaking to them. Very friendly and hiring manager told me I have a great background and they'd love to discuss sales positions when I'm back.

Where might I look? Any ideas besides roaming through Indeed endlessly?

I am currently in desperate need to secure a source of income. I have a doctorate degree in physical therapy but have been significantly burnt out by clinical work from my last position and am looking for a change. I have been seeking something new and applying without prevail for nearly the past 6 months (typically positions still in the healthcare field, but roles not involving clinical care). I am also taking google's project management coursera course to add various other skills to my resume. I have been receiving job rejection emails left and right, including those stating entry level or only a GED requirement, and am becoming quite discouraged with the process (as well as beginning to panic). 

At this point, I am willing to take on any type of remote role possible, related to my field of study or not, that will allow for cash flow as I have some pretty hefty student loans to pay off. 

I am currently seeking advice, tips, tricks, possible job postings, websites to check out (I have scanned this forum for some popular ones already and appreciate everyone who has contributed), or just some overall help and insight as I am currently at a dead end and feel that I haven't been able to experience any notable positives in my current search.

qsabh2,"Remote work, Office work, or Hybrid Work, what will you choose?","The pandemic has defined the importance of remote working skills as a top priority. Analysts expected that employers will increase work from home or remote work options by adopting hybrid work culture as the future of work. And Yes! They were right. Today, businesses that can rely on digital technologies and internet-based platforms are at the cusp of revolution. It is a much-needed and most logical revolution that completely transmogrifies processes and paves the growth ways for businesses as well as the people.

The remote or hybrid work culture works best or only can happen with the right set of well-equipped talents. Benefits and Assets that are being provided to associates play a vital role in remote work culture. Flexible or Hybrid work culture is something that is going to take over the remote work culture with its benefits. A company, Ajackus has set an example of how a company can work fully hybrid or with a flexible work culture.

17ryiaj,Much needed Advice - Remote work and grief!," 

**Hello wonderful people\~**

I will try to sum up everything that is happening because I truly need some advice.  
After covid mostly, I have been struggling a bit with work. I was working from home for a company but they only needed us for one specific project, when it was over they sent us our way. So the last year I have been trying to find credible information of what I can do online and I was living with my mom which I was also taking care of. Well we took care of each other. She was my best friend.

This summer while I was away for a couple of weeks.... I lost my mother. I couldn't believe my ears when the girl I had to take care of her called me to tell me about an in home accident.  
My whole world collapsed. I still cannot believe it. I miss her terribly every single day. Some days I feel I can handle it and some days I'm beyond devastated.

Due to me not being in our apartment when it happened, a whole procedure started and I am still not able to go back until they do all the paperwork. Yes on top of grieving I cannot even go to my own home and have access to my things.

So I am lucky enough to have amazing friends that I stay with but I am ""forced"" to move around cities and sometimes abroad. This makes it so difficult to find a job in person. I tried but when you have to go around, they wont really hire you.

I am in such a loss. I don't know how to think. I am grieving, and I am basically broke and I don't even have my things, winter clothes etc. I basically sometimes don't understand what Is happening and I am not sure how to handle it? I did post on a grief thread as well of course. 

I am in desperate need for a job to at least pay bills that keep coming and get food, and possibly winter clothes -\_- ... and most ""online"" things I see people suggesting turn out to either be scams asking you for money too, or things that don't work or need years of work . (I am in Europe) Any suggestions on the matter?  
I just...I miss my mother so much (I lost my dad when I was in high school so now it's just me, no siblings either) , I miss our home and I am extremely overwhelmed with what is happening and also with all the paperwork that I am not even sure how to do.

*Thank you for reading. I am sorry it was a bit long. I just need to take these things out of me. I know some people may be going through similar things. You never know when you might get great advice or a friendly ear to listen.*

1awebfx,Full-time remote experience for people living alone,"Hi.

>TL;DR Working fully remote sounds lonely AF, convince me otherwise

I am an avid office goer. If at all possible, I am there everyday, purely because I want to. I like the office environment, the networking and socialising, and the routines that go with it. It feels childhood school days, showing up and meeting the gang and doing things together. I have developed many meaningful friendships that started in the workplace and continued beyond that.

Working completely remotely concerns me. I am in my early 30s, working in IT, and am an expat in a foreign country, single, without kids, living in an apartment alone. There are however many interesting career opportunities that seem to be fully  remote, and it appears to slowly become the norm.

I am concerned that I will feel isolated, lonely, and start to develop bad habits. Things like only waking up 5 minutes before a morning meeting, not having clearly defined start/end work times, not leaving the home or speaking to a real face for days on end, not taking the time to eat real food.

During corona, my life was getting out of bed, walking 5 steps to my desk, working for 8hours, closing the work apps and opening personal apps, and eventually walking 5 steps back to my bed. I don't want to go back to that.

I hear many stories about people with relationships, families, kids, etc. who rave about how great they feel working from home. I do not hear any such ravings from people who are alone, though.

q9gtut,The truth about non-phone work at home remote jobs.,"There is a common question on this subreddit nearly everyday about wanting to find a work-from-home job that does not require talking to people on the phone.

I applied for a chat job a couple of weeks ago with a popular staffing agency. I received an invite to a virtual interview that included questions where you would respond by audio or typing short answers that consisted of 2-4 sentences.

One of the questions asked was about phone calls which confused me because accepting inbound calls was not listed in the job posting or title.

Recruiters are aware that non-phone jobs are extremely popular among job seekers and will attract a lot of applicants. Many are posting misleading job ads or straight up lying about the job requirements.

According to Indeed, a chat specialist position for Gubagoo received over 17,000 job applicants on Indeed alone. That number does not include people who applied directly on the company's website or other job boards. For data entry, Adecco, a staffing agency, had 8,761 people who applied on Indeed. The other data entry and chat jobs received over 2,000 applicants.


Meanwhile, some Fortune 500 entry-level jobs paying $40,000-$60,000 with benefits are getting 60-100 applications because people are scared to talk on the phone .


Due to the high volume of applicants and the very few non-phone positions available, there is a STRONG chance you will NOT find a non-phone job.

There are exceptions for those with experience and degrees in IT, computer science, and accounting.

There is the internet search evaluator/rater but you must pass the exams which are not easy. It is not a full time position. You can only work up to 20 hours.

Even if you do find a non-phone job, the pay is significantly less and those who worked as a chat agent said they were expected to talk to 5 people at once and that is not as easy as others believe it to be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/q9gtut/the_truth_about_nonphone_work_at_home_remote_jobs/,1634406371.0,121,344,WorkOnline

ruokya,Just because a job is remote doesn't mean it will be good.,"I feel like a lot of people don't understand this. As someone who got a taste of working from home during lockdowns I LOVED it. It's nice working remotely. But there are ABSOLUTELY jobs you should probably avoid. If these jobs are shitty jobs in general, then working from home won't change that... in fact, it will probably make them WORSE.

For me, the biggest red flags are customer support jobs. Whenever a job ad states they're looking for a ""rockstar"" or ""hero"" I know IMMEDIATELY that they're desperate and can fuck right off. Call centers are by and large also just shitty places to work for. Two call center companies YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY AVOID:

1) Sykes

2) Conduent

These jobs will make your life a living hell. I worked for Conduent and it was garbage. My friend, bless his soul, somehow lasted 6 months at Sykes. I didn't even last a month at Conduent. The call volume and shitty customers were just too much for me. And I say that as someone who just finished working two years as an office admin answering 60-100 calls a day. So phones for me are not an issue when people aren't jackasses 95% of the time. 

Even though I REALLY want to work remotely I WILL NOT stoop so low as to take a shitty job just to do it and neither should you. However, I recognize that these are troubling times so if you're desperate I can understand needing to apply to these jobs. 

Feel free to post good/bad companies to work for and what your thoughts are on this down below. I'll go ahead and recommend Caption Call as a good company to work for since you don't actually speak with anyone. I worked for them back in 2013 and they were great. I make a lot more than they offer now though so it would be pointless to go back for me at this point.

h9idyv,Where to find thousands of remote work / online jobs,"Here's a guide to the best places to find remote jobs.

It's from this [article](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/where-to-find-thousands-of-non-tech) (body text copied here so you don't need to click out)

**Where To Find Thousands of Non-Tech Remote Jobs**

Hi,

Welcome to Remotely Inclined, a newsletter about remote work and remote entrepreneurship. If you'd like to sign up, you can do so [here](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/welcome). Or just read on...

Before I started my business, I was laid off twice in a matter of three years. The instant thoughts and fear of whether you'll be able to pay rent (or a mortgage), pay for food, or provide for a family is damn-near heartbreaking. My soul goes out to you if you've recently found yourself jobless because of the global pandemic going on. 

As the title of this newsletter suggests, though, there are literally *thousands* of remote-first jobs that you can get - and yes, they are still hiring even through this pandemic. 

If you're not feeling totally ready to jump on the job-search train, I get it. My good friend Lianne Vineberg, a brilliant HR consultant and talent strategist, wrote a solid article on [what to do when you've been laid off](https://www.talentinthe6ix.com/blog/so-you-got-laid-off) (hint: it involves taking a quick break if you can).

If you ARE ready to find a job, or perhaps financial circumstances have forced you to be ready, that's what this newsletter is all about - the places that you can find remote jobs.

Two quick things before we dive in: 

1. If you have a secure job, that's amazing. I ask that you forward this to any folks you might know that are out of work (or in precarious employment, likely to be out of work soon). 
2. If you are intrigued by remote but really can't stand it, there are many companies hiring tens of thousands of in-person jobs such as [Walmart, Domino's Pizza, and more](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/hiring-companies-seek-thousands-employees-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story?id=69767851). Just think of companies that make things everyone hoards in a crisis, and you'll find job opportunities. 

**Remotive io**

Remotive is a large community of remote workers and remote companies. While most of their jobs revolve around technical skills, there are many customer service, marketing, and support roles which don't require any technical skills. If you worked in retail and got laid off, these roles could be perfect for you. 

Link: [https://remotive.io/remote-jobs](https://remotive.io/remote-jobs)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remotiveio](https://twitter.com/remotiveio)

**Daily Remote Jobs**

A job board and Twitter feed that shares all sorts of remote jobs. The best part is that most jobs are worldwide, meaning that you don't have to be worried about your location when you apply. Their schtick right now is about finding a remote job so you can travel the world. The travel part doesn't apply in this case, but the jobs are very real.

Link: [https://dailyremote.com/](https://dailyremote.com/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/daily\_remote](https://twitter.com/daily_remote)

**Remote OK**

Another job board with thousands of remote jobs posted, and more posted every day. The advanced filtering for job types is a helpful way for you to filter out jobs you really don't want to do or aren't qualified for (thinking those remote dev jobs if you're not a developer). 

Link: [https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs](https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/RemoteOK](https://twitter.com/RemoteOK)

**WeWorkRemotely**

Self-touted as the number one destination to find a remote job, WWR boasts jobs added daily. 

Pro-tip: The site doesn't have much in the way of filtering, so you'll have to scroll down to see the non-dev /non-tech roles. 

Link: [https://weworkremotely.com/#job-listings](https://weworkremotely.com/#job-listings)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/weworkremotely](https://twitter.com/weworkremotely)

**Remote Co**

While Remote Co is primarily a resource for remote company leaders (which could be great if you suddenly find yourself in that position!), the site also has an extensive job board. This platform seems to be the most non-tech friendly, since many job categories are things like finance, admin, data entry, content, and more. 

Link: [https://remote.co/remote-jobs/](https://remote.co/remote-jobs/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remote\_co](https://twitter.com/remote_co)

**Remote Habits**

Remote Habits is a blog about remote work, featuring remote workers and remote entrepreneurs (I was even [featured](https://remotehabits.com/interview/interview-with-stefan-a-founder-building-a-location-independent-startup/)!). On top of that, they have a job board that scrapes remote jobs from all over the web. That means you may see a lot of duplication (particularly from WeWorkRemotely), but you'll also find additional jobs that are posted in smaller job boards or ones you may not know about. 

Link: [https://remotehabits.com/jobs/](https://remotehabits.com/jobs/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remotehabits](https://twitter.com/remotehabits)

**FlexJobs**

A resource for all kinds of jobs, FlexJobs has an explicit section for remote work. The platform also features research on companies and other job-seeker aids. Most of the jobs are for Americans only, but it's possible that you could still apply and perhaps get hired as an independent contractor. 

Link: [https://www.flexjobs.com/jobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/jobs). You can also check out this [pre-defined search for remote work jobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/search?search=&exclude=&location=&country=&tele_level%5B%5D=All+Telecommuting&tele_level%5B%5D=Option+for+Telecommuting&will_travel%5B%5D=&accolade=).

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/flexjobs](https://twitter.com/flexjobs)

**Dynamite Jobs**

Based out of Texas, Dynamite Jobs is a global community with a focus on remote work. The platform has some of the best filtering mechanisms I've seen in the remote job board world - timezone, salary, job category, and more. 

Link: [https://dynamitejobs.co/](https://dynamitejobs.co/)

LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/dynamite-jobs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dynamite-jobs/)

**LinkedIn + Craigslist**

LinkedIn is the world's largest professional social network and Craigslist is the world's largest digital classifieds. In both cases, there are tons of jobs and the opportunity to search for remote jobs or ""telecommuting"" jobs. 

Note: Craigslist has a reputation for being sketchy, so be careful. However, many jobs posted are completely legitimate and shouldn't be discounted.

Link: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=92000001&location=Remote](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=92000001&location=Remote)

Link: [Craigslist.com](https://craigslist.com/) (Then go to jobs - Telecommute filter for your city)

**Niche Google search**

Sometimes, the work you're looking for or are qualified for doesn't fit into a neat job board. When in doubt, try some googling. 

I recommend using one of two Google formulae: 

1. ""Remote job board \[LOCATION\]""
2. ""Remote \[JOB TYPE\] jobs \[LOCATION\]""

With the first style, you'll likely find a lot more open roles. The second style, though, could help you land the perfect job if you already know exactly what you want to do. 

And if you've already tried these searches in the past... I'd say try again. With the pandemic growing, many companies are shifting to remote when they previously would never have thought about it. 

**Don't forget to ask**

If you're applying to any role that's done on a computer, don't be afraid to ask if they will accept remote work -- at least for the time being. Some companies had never thought of remote, so they wouldn't know until you ask. If the company says they want to focus on in-office work only, there may still be flexibility for you to work remotely while a pandemic is going on and then transition to the office world when the time is right. 

I know that applying for jobs can feel scary. I had to do it a bunch when I got laid off before deciding to focus on my business. But my hope is that these resources help you just a little bit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/h9idyv/where_to_find_thousands_of_remote_work_online_jobs/,1592234483.0,50,554,WorkOnline
mvl9k9,A job board that only accepts jobs that are 100% remote,"Howdy Remoters!

I'm [Luc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-mengel/). I'm the founder of [Remotewx](https://remotewx.com/).

I've launched Remotewx 

Remotewx is a remote job board on the web to help you find a career where you can work remotely from anywhere. We only accept listings for job positions that are 100% remote. Most of the companies we share are distributed or remote-first companies.

Now you may ask: *""Does the world need another job board?""* I completely agree with you [](https://emojipedia.org/folded-hands/) . But many of my friends are still unable to find a remote job. Why? It is because, many job boards do not differentiate between covid-remote and full time remote. A company that is fully distributed from the ground up is not the same as a company that offers work from home during covid.  
At remotewx - We have a lot of  for companies that are completely remote.

It has to constantly scan our face biometrics and we have to scan our government Id when clocking in.

15fwjdh,"The pros and cons of remote work, based on 6 months of experience.","Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience of working remotely for the past few months. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but overall I'm really enjoying the flexibility and freedom that comes with it. I wanted to start a discussion on the pros and cons of working from home.

Pros: Working remotely has given me more flexibility in my schedule. I can take breaks when I need to, and I can work around other commitments. It has also allowed me to spend more time with my family, since I don't have to commute. I also appreciate the increased productivity that comes from being able to focus without office distractions.  


Cons: When you're working remotely, it can be hard to disconnect from work. The boundaries between your personal life and your work life become blurred, and it can be difficult to relax and unwind. This is especially true if you work from a home office. Isolation and loneliness are other common challenges of remote work. Without regular interactions with coworkers and the outside world, it's easy to feel disconnected and alone. Finally, remote work can make it harder to manage your time and stay focused.

ajr1bh,We're hiring again at 4PatientCare! [Awesome Remote Job],"**We've closed the application process, and will now begin sorting through applications and contacting applicants. If you applied, you will hear back once a decision is made on your application.** 

Hey r/WorkOnline! I'm the Customer Success Manager at 4PatientCare, and [we are hiring again](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/7gxdfu/were_hiring_again_at_4patientcare_awesome_remote/)! We've always had good luck finding awesome candidates through Reddit (I was hired from a Reddit post!) Check us out at [4PatientCare.com](https://4PatientCare.com).

We are looking to hire a Technical Support Agent.  Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

A little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes the world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions. This is a place for people who are willing to take on any challenge that comes their way. ""That's not in my job description"" is not a phrase we believe in. We're more of an ""I'll figure it out!"" kind of team.

Transparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve (here are our [Glassdoor ratings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-4PatientCare-EI_IE760463.11,23.htm)). We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team.

Also don't be fooled, we're not a startup. We've been in business for nearly 20 years delivering more happiness to healthcare.

&#x200B;

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively. We do not micro-manage and we do not hand-hold. We strike a balance between giving enough training and direction so that you're not totally in the shark tank without a life vest, but oftentimes it'll be up to you to be proactive to problem-solve and get. things. done. If you're lost and without a map, do you wait for someone to notice and show you the way or do you actively reach out to get the direction you need to move forward?
* A natural curiosity and a strong desire to learn. Do you thirst for knowledge and yearn to explore the unknown? Do you like to know how things are put together and what makes them tick?
* The ability to roll with the punches in a dynamic work environment. Do you welcome change and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing setting?
* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art? Is an upset client someone you fear or just another opportunity to turn someone's frown upside down?
* Strong organization skills and attention to detail. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day? Can someone throw ten tasks at you with specific instructions for each and trust that everything will get done and get done right?

The main responsibilities of 4PatientCare Technical Support Agents include, but are not limited to:

* Setting up new clients and existing clients with their requested services.
* Assisting with basic pricing changes that occur when clients request changes to their current services.
* Taking incoming communications to support existing clients regarding issues, bugs, feature requests, and feedback.
* Engaging with customers about those issues, bugs, and feature requests and managing expectations about when everything will be resolved.
* Quantifying the importance of those issues/bugs, measuring feature request frequency, and advocating for the fixes users are finding most troublesome.
* Understanding the direct impact our services and service have on our clients, and within the confines of our system, doing everything possible to benefit clients' businesses.
* Creating and updating support documentation as processes improve.
* Assisting and training on tasks and areas that you have become proficient in.

Basic Requirements:

* Must be a US citizen and reside in one of the following states: AL, CA, CO, FL, GA, MA, NC, NV, NY, PA, or UT.
* Must be fluent in English.
* Must have a computer and a working Internet connection.

Compensation:

* $16/hour during initial training period, which lasts a minimum of 3 months.
* $18/hour after graduating from training
* Paid Time Off (up to 10 days a year), Paid Holidays Off (6 per year)
* Monthly Health Insurance Reimbursement (up to $300 per month)
* 401K
* Weekly prizes at the Company Friday game... If you win :P

uq79bk,Remote work expectations - company wants to terminate me because they won't give me essential work equipment (and I won't purchase it myself),"TLDR; Company didn't tell me that I needed to use my personal laptop (w/ VPN and remote desktop) for my new remote job, which started on 5/2. When I told them I couldn't use mine (notified them before the start date), they sent me a wiped laptop that never arrived (delivery link says delayed for a week). They know this, and now they're saying that I need to find a way to connect to their VPN by tomorrow or they'll terminate me. I had offered to push my start date to after the laptop issue was sorted, but they said no -- I was supposed to receive my first paycheck on 5/13, but I haven't, and I'm worried that they're going to withhold my income even though they told me that I would be paid despite knowing I didn't have the laptop yet. My questions are:

(1) Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and would I not qualify for unemployment? I live in Illinois, even though the job is in Ohio.

(2) If they withhold my income from the first 10 days of work, is there anything I can do about it? I read online that federal law only requires employers to compensate minimum wage for hours worked and that's all I'd be guaranteed to receive, even if my offer letter stated my salary.

(3) Is my frustration here fair? Like, would it be reasonable for them to expect me to just use my own computer for this job even if they didn't say that during the hiring process?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently accepted a data science job offer from a large hospital, where I would be working with sensitive data. They advertised the position as remote friendly, and sent me an offer letter (I did not sign a contract, since I thought it best to keep things as flexible as possible). They were aware that I would be working 100% remotely.

It is standard in data science (unless you're part of a very small non-profit or start-up) to receive your computer equipment from the employer (most data scientists need a laptop at the least, and many also receive monitors or docking systems), so this is what I expected in this position. A couple of days before my scheduled start date, I realized that they had never formally told me that they were sending me any equipment. I reached out and asked, and they said that they expected me to use a VPN and Remote Desktop to connect to their on-campus computers for the job (without ever clarifying whether I had the tools to do this myself), and that he could give me a $100 Amazon gift card to ""furnish my office"". He reassured me that this setup was perfectly safe, though the security configuration stuff isn't my purview.

My computer sucks and wouldn't function properly for this, and beyond that, I wasn't comfortable with the idea of using my personal computer for work in any sense ($100 wouldn't make a dent in the cost of a new one). I (politely) told my boss that I couldn't use a personal computer and needed a company laptop for the job, and that the job description never said that I would be expected to furnish my own equipment. He said that they could send me a retired 2-3 year old laptop as a ""gift"" - which I found strange because it felt like they were trying to dissociate themselves from the computer and made me worried about liability working with sensitive data. He added that the entire thing had been wiped and I would be expected to install a new operating system myself (specifically, Microsoft 10 and would need to purchase the $150 license); IT also said that sending me a fully set up company laptop would not be the ""best use of resources"". I asked them if I would be reimbursed for this, and whether the Amazon gift card could be put towards this instead, and my boss said I should be happy I'm getting a free laptop and that I should offer them flexibility because they had been flexible with me working two positions at the same time (they made the conscious choice to hire me, knowing that upfront). He rescinded the $100 offer and said he'd ""try"" to lump the reimbursement into my signing bonus, which I declined because that can be retracted if I leave within a year of my hire - but I said I would do my best to install a free operating system and let them know how that goes, and they agreed. I told them that I'm also happy to push my start date (5/2) to after the laptop issue had been resolved, and they said no, and that they would still pay me and I could focus on other tasks in the meantime (like onboarding, research, and reviewing SQL).

The laptop was supposed to arrive on 5/6, but it never did and the tracking link says ""delayed"" indefinitely. It's been over a week now and boss is saying that I have to find a way to connect to the VPN tomorrow, or they'll terminate me, unless I choose to move to Ohio for the job instead. I also checked Workday and saw that I was supposed to be paid on 5/13, but I never received the deposit and I'm worried they'll try to withhold it. Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and can they legally withhold my income from the first week even though they knew that I didn't receive the laptop from them?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/uq79bk/remote_work_expectations_company_wants_to/,1652624861.0,56,131,WorkOnline

Am I thinking of it the right way, or should I just apply anyway even though I'm in the UK?

188da1l,"Remote Appointment Setting Jobs with base pay? Not ""commission only""?","Landed a really great one this past summer with a start-up insurance b2b broker firm. Flexible, good ""kept appt"" commission, paid .40 per call, however that REALLY added up, full-time, esp with all these no answers. Got a lot of appts set, good commissions, paid weekly, etc. Received top performer rewards, bosses considering me for an even bigger roll.  However, starting around after Halloween, we were getting tons of push back by receptionists/aka ""gatekeepers"" (screening for solicitations, etc lol) and decision maker managers,  open enrollment wrapping up soon, ""we already renewed"" or whatever other crap. After a great run of weeks prior. So, after three weeks of hardly any appts set between myself, two other seasoned setters, and the two licensed sales agent bosses, the main boss decided to put the call center on a ""prospecting freeze"" which will possibly lift after the holidays and resume by ""quarter 1"". As the holidays will be a huge waste of money with nobody available, or not til later, or unwilling to change anything until then. And I got a really nice check....they paid me for every appt I'd set upcoming and ones prior that didn't even show, out of a courtesy, and an additional $500 on top of my base weekly pay. But, they'd given like zero forewarning of this freeze. Even despite my nagging them feedback about issues and us needing to have a team meeting to find some solutions. plus the scripting they had us use was pretty bad. Boss 1 was willing to try some new strategies and do a team meeting set for the Monday before the freeze was announced, but the Thursday before, boss 2 butted heads with boss 1 and said it'll make no difference. Let's freeze. We are 1099'ers, mind you, so we aren't privy to retention pay. 
So, while they're ""restrategizing"" etc I've been applying like crazy, once again, to everything and trying new ways of searching. Like organic Google search of outsource companies and looking via their career sections. As indeed and LinkedIn seem to be mostly scams!!!!!!!!!!!!!! any wfh setters, BDC, rep, anything. or spoofs of real companies. it took me two years, over thousands of applications, to land that one damn job. lol. Rejections from good ones because, assuming I failed their stupid assessments, personality tests and timed nonsense that I REALLY suck at. 

I have so many years experience in bdc rep, retail sales, automotive sales, medical office,  call rep, sales management, appt setting, b2b, have my own freelance graphics and media co. which seems to be a failure since a year ago, and lack of need or interest in that, and can't even get regular normal work in even that!!!  etc so should be no reason not to. But wondering if there's any suggestions on certain companies to look into, other clever searching tactics, keywording tactics, niche things, etc. Have been keeping eye on the WFH mom job blogs, rat race rebellion, etc. apply to everything there when they pop up lol. Rejected from Telus after they had me in line to do their exam. Data annotation seems impossible to get into.... over saturated???
I live in Ohio, so many aren't eligible for certain states. Had a few that tried to loophole that, because I was a great fit, but that didn't work out. lol. 

Also, what's the likelihood that my current company will resume business again this coming quarter? Its a start-up b2b insurance firm where we try and set appts for small to medium companies to sit in for a zoom qualification review with the sales team. they however, are only focusing on the tristate for now. Kinda limiting it.

Also, any tips on searching for ""remote order takers"" or other alternative niche remote ones like that? anything work from home, with some sorta base pay, at least. 
Been trying calling local places to see if they'd be interested in an appt setter as well. Had luck with one, but they were only wanting to do commission only then turned out they weren't a very kosher kinda run company and a legal-grey area with their practices. So, didn't pursue any further. 
Had a solar sales place interested back when I was still working with the other company, but they're no longer looking, supposedly.  Apricot Solar. lol. 

An outsource call center/ BDC company I found while randomly searching Google and checking out company sites and their job openings,  was also interested, had interview #1, went very well  , was onto interview #2, and basically had the job until the main manager had a miscommunication issue with the other one and they hired another person day before my second interview even happened yet it was scheduled, and that manager wasn't willing to ...remedy their mistake in the end. Long story. Then it got weirder.  Was really weird. Was a company I wanted to work with, but the one manager and how they ran the company... kinda gave me pause. 
But yet its supposedly this great company... and located in the area I grew up in.

10smpyb,What remote work am I qualified for in Germany?,"Hi! I'm not sure exactly what information I'm supposed to be looking for or how to search for jobs but I've seen a lot of helpful information on this sub. I'm sorry if you've seen a lot of similar posts and I seem repetitive!!

I 20f am moving to a small town in Germany with my husband for his military orders, we're moving in a little less than 6mo so it's about that point where I'm getting anxious about planning. From what I've learned from other spouses that I've spoken to, there's not much work available in these small towns that either don't require speaking German or having a bachelors and my other option would be working on the military base, which my education would still be an issue unless I wanted to work more of a customer service/clerk role. I would ultimately prefer to work remote if possible, but I'm not too sure what my options would be.

A little background on me, I currently work as an office manager at a small chiropractic clinic and have some general knowledge about insurance and billing as well as the typical administrative tasks. I started here almost two years ago and have worked my way to this position from the front desk. My only other experience is some jobs from high school (barista/shift lead).

I don't have any post high school education(to my regret) and I understand that a lot of remote jobs might not care for my current skill set but I was hoping to see if anyone had some ideas on what might be a good fit. I've struggled a lot to find solid answers on what/if companies based in the US allow for work across different countries and I am running out of time to build up my skills. 

Thank you for taking time to read this post and I hope I didn't ramble too much, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/10smpyb/what_remote_work_am_i_qualified_for_in_germany/,1675437356.0,6,22,WorkOnline
fwq1if,"I made a decent list of companies hiring for online, remote work (USA) - No Referral Links","

Hello, from quarantine, USA!

 
I have seen a huge number of posts requesting the same thing- ""How do I work from home/ online?"" and starting about two weeks ago, I was in the same boat. I spent the good part of the first week delving into any and all subs, posts, leads, anything that could get me money, while I am at home and no longer working. A lot of these places do take some time for hiring, but this is the list I came up with. Hope it helps some of you guys out there!
 

I had previously used r/beermoney sites and apps, all of the usual suspects, such as Swagbucks, InboxDollars, etc. and never really found a liking, or real use for such low paying survey and ""Paid To"" sites/apps- though there were a few winners that I discovered:
 

-Qmee, QuickThoughts, BigToken, and though the questions are rare, payments are instant and take literally seconds to answer-> 1Q
 

-       Honeygain-> interesting app, you sell unused data. I average about $0.08-0.15 per day just for having it installed on my phone. Minimum payout is $20.00 and when I downloaded I used a code to start with $5 right off the bat.

EDIT: HoneyGain was only applicable to android/ windows users when I signed up. I have since gotten notifications that they have expanded to apple as well, but cannot confirm personally- if someone can in the comments that would be appreciated.
 

ACTUAL WORK:
 

So, as I mentioned I am looking for actual working opportunities. I do not have any secondary education, just a high school diploma. This limited my selection pool, but not nearly as much as I had thought, given that I have an interest in writing and have previously used websites such as Fiverr and Upwork, so I had a small professional portfolio to work with, though it was old content. Freelancing is fun and I will get more into that later, but now the jobs:
 

USER TESTING:
 

User testing is generally testing websites for security, bugs, display, a number of things and projects. These companies offer work in this field-
 

Appen/Teemwork.ai, LionsBridge, TryMyUI
 

VIRTUAL ASSISTANT:
 

Generally requires a landline and wired internet, though not all companies. Fast typing skills and being a personable person is key.
 

FancyHands, VickyVirtual, Zapier, Ttec,
 

TRANSCRIPTION:
 

This is typing out audio from videos, or audio files- sounds easy, but beware, some files can have horrendous audio from the research I have done into this field.


QAWorld, GoTranscript, Rev, Transcom
 

WRITING:
 

As I mentioned earlier, I have an interest in writing and have used freelance sites such as Fiverr and Upwork before (note: those sites can be used for more than just freelance writing), but upon more digging there are quite a few sites to check out if you enjoy writing. I may get shilled for promoting content mills, but hey, we all gotta start somewhere:
 

iWriter, TextBroker, PostLoop, ProBlogger, Constant Content, Crowd Content
 

PAY TO SITES:
 

Much like the r/beermoney apps and sites, these mostly involve surveys and clicking, but figured they were noteworthy and shouldn't be left out of the list:
 

Gain.gg, Prolific.co, ClickWorker, Neevo, Google Ratings, Amazon MTurk
 

 
Best of luck everyone, stay safe and prosperous!

18600dc,Questions to Ask Employer to Test Legitimacy? (remote jobs),"Hello all! So I am in the process of finding a job. I have my BA in English and my plan is to secure a remote job (probably in proofreading, editing, copywriting or something of that nature) that offers insurance and flexible work hours. Im just trying to get a big girl job (and save gas money) as opposed to my previous jobs as a barista/waitress. Also, I don't really care what I do in a sense because I am actually an artist and am just trying to find a remote job that will fund my hobbies and help out my mom.

  
In my gut I feel as if Im closer than ever to finding an online job that works for me, but Im struggling with legitimizing the job offers I get.

  
Every once in a while I get a message from employers (text and or email) asking if they can interview me and now Im wondering, are there questions that I can ask them upfront to deduce that they might be scammers?

  
Im asking this because I recently got scammed by an online employer. It low-key broke my heart a little because the job and pay were practically perfect, and I want to help my mom out with the bills as soon as possible.

  
What questions should I ask these possible employers to figure out if they are legit or not? What are the major red flags? What are the major green flags?

1b62jyf,Appen randomly bans my account for no reason / Any other remote job alternatives?,"Hello, first post here, but I just felt like I needed to bring this matter to attention as I'm wondering if I'm the only with this problem or if others had it as well.

For a few years, I had always been trying to apply for remote work with Appen, but I've never got qualified for one. The last time I tried, I gave up, and the system later on locked my account due to inactivity. That was how it was like back then. So when I wasn't able to sign in recently, I thought it was due to that again. However, I still couldn't sign in even after doing a password reset. So I went to support about this and basically this is what they told me...

>**""Thank you for reaching out. Currently, Appen has made the decision to deactivate your account, and unfortunately, we are unable to reactivate it. As business decisions are considered confidential information, we are unable to provide further details. We sincerely appreciate the time you have dedicated to working on our projects, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for your understanding.""**

*So when I went to ask further about why my account was banned, this is all I get as their last response:*

>**""We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you that, following a routine review of user activity on our platform, your account has been Permanently deactivated.**  
>  
>**As a committed provider of a safe and respectful digital environment, we maintain a strict policy adhering to our community standards. These guidelines have been developed to ensure that all users and clients feel comfortable and protected while engaging with our platform. It is our duty to inform you that there have been instances of activities linked to your account that appear to be in violation of these standards.**  
>  
>**Our dedicated team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into these activities.

Our decision is based on the information gathered during this process and is final.**  
>  
>**Thank you for your attention.""**

It seems apparent to me that now Appen acts very similar to YouTube, where they just randomly decide to shut down people's accounts for no good apparent reason. Which explains the lack of transparency here. As they can't even at least tell me why, yet they have the audacity to state that they can't even share details why due to privacy and safety reasons over guidelines that once again aren't even mentioned. All of this as their way to get over and ban me just because they felt like it.

Again, I would like to know if anyone else experienced this as well. It's just strange to me because unlike some, I've never even got a remote job with them. All I ever had done prior to this random ban was me simply trying to apply for remote work, which had always been unsuccessful. My wild guess is maybe they became overly paranoid or something. Telus seems way more trustworthy as I've never had any issues like this with them. Whereas I did at least got qualified with one remote job as an ads evaluator / rater. But that only lasted one year as a contract.

So now I'm still trying to look for more remote job opportunities. The only else that sorta helps out is Prolific which I found from here. Anyone here got any good suggestions or alternatives over Appen?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/1b62jyf/appen_randomly_bans_my_account_for_no_reason_any/,1709528637.0,4,13,WorkOnline

i00lwo,The changing ways people talk about remote work,"When I first started working remotely, people were talking about ""remote work"" (or even ""telecommuting"") in a lot of different ways. COVID has certainly changed how we talk about remote work, but the shift was underway for years. 

I published the [original content in my newsletter](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/the-shifting-trends-in-how-people), but copied the body text here in full so you don't have to click out.

**The Shifting Trends in How People Talk About Remote Work**

I started my remote business in 2017, though it was remote out of necessity, not privilege. My business was a side-hustle until 2019. I still had a 9-to-5 job and couldn't run any business that required my physical presence. But before that, I was paying attention to the burgeoning remote work movement. 

Remote work had been a thing since the dawn of the internet (and arguably before that), but it started to hit a stride in 2014 after a major Harvard Business Review article: [To Raise Productivity, Let More Employees Work from Home](https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home). This interview took aim at Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo! CEO that famously stopped all flexible work arrangements and brought everyone back into the office (no comment on how that worked for Yahoo!). 

Now fast forward to 2020, and everyone's talking about remote work. It's tempting to say it's all cause of COVID (and admittedly a *lot* of it is), but these conversations had been happening for years already.

So for today's newsletter, I'm diving into the shifts I've seen in how people talked about remote work, in particular the evolution over the past five-ish years. 

Without further ado...

## From fad to fan fave

Remote work was seen as a novel thing in 2014 / 2015. Despite it being leveraged by many successful companies at the time (Automattic - the makers of Wordpress - is remote and was founded in 2005), it was largely talked about as either a fad or the domain of some tech nerds but not the bulk of the economy. 

Now, studies abound on the popularity of remote work. A Stanford University [study](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html) from 2017 shows how much more productive employees are. OwlLabs [State of Remote Work study in 2019](https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2019) found that remote workers are happier and stay in jobs longer. And now a Gartner [study](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time) from 2020 shows that 82% of companies are planning some form of remote work for the future. 

## From individuals to companies

Perhaps the largest shift in the remote conversation came from a shift in focus. 

In 2015, a lot of the remote conversation was focused on the individual - in particular, the digital nomad, or the person who is a remote worker or freelancer for the sake of travelling the world. One entrepreneur proclaimed there would be [one billion digital nomads](https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/) by 2035. From there, major publications from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2015/12/22/globetrotting-digital-nomads-the-future-of-work-or-too-good-to-be-true/#271890767594) to the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/16/digital-nomads-travel-world-search-fast-wi-fi) covered the digital nomad craze, questioning whether it was the future of work.

It's also worth noting the gig economy was a strong player at this time, with companies like Uber taking hold. So the whole economic conversation was around gigs, freelancers, and the potential of technology. 

In 2020, the conversation is all about how companies can win at remote work (heck, it's what I even talk about on Remotely Inclined). With remote assumed to become a common way of work, there's less need to highlight the rare individuals who made it work. 

## Remote became a status symbol

I interviewed [Shelly Spiegel](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/our-success-is-because-of-culture), the founder of 80+ person all-remote company Fire Engine Red. The company has been remote since Shelly founded it in 2001, but she didn't start talking about their all-remote status until 2011. But even at that time, companies were hesitant to make too much of being remote. The same thing happened with [Floyd Marinescu](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/you-need-to-build-systems-the-inner), who founded all-remote company C4 Media in 2005.

Pride for being remote started to creep in during the 2010's, but it was not necessarily an outward or marketing thing. 

Just a few short years later, being ""remote before COVID"" is a rallying cry. Having technology or services that can be delivered remotely is a competitive advantage (with obvious reasons in COVID's case). This is something even I've benefited from, having been remote in 2017. This isn't uncommon, though. When things become mainstream, those who did it ""before it was cool"" will always get a credibility bump. 

## Remote washing, bashing, and branding

With popularity comes criticism. That can't be avoided. But it's been interesting to see the progression of how people criticize remote work. 

In the early days, it was simply written off. This was perhaps ironic, since people were becoming millionaires on the backs of their remote businesses, a model that naysayers wrote off as nearly impossible. 

Now we see three new trends. Naysayers can't deny remote work's efficacy (though I happily admit that remote work is not perfect for every person nor every type of work). Instead, we see conversations around: 

* **Remote washing**: slapping some marketing language about how your product works for remote teams. 
* **Remote bashing**: leveraging personal negative experiences with remote work to generalize that remote work is *actually* bad. 
* **Remote branding**: shifting the company's identity to include remote (in some cases, acting like it's always been there). 

Remote washing is almost a compliment. When everyone changes their marketing language to catch onto a rising star, it helps separate out the people who actually focus on it and do the work well.

Remote bashing is similarly almost a compliment. When you're written off out of hand, you are considered culturally irrelevant. If you're being bashed, the underlying truth is that you're part of societal conversation. Plus, it's usually pretty easy to tell when someone is universalizing their own negative experience or personal distaste versus putting out an actual criticism (the latter of which is *not* remote bashing, but honest conversation).

Remote branding is a mixed bag, in my opinion. Sometimes it's very legitimate. For example, if a company always had some work flexibility but now they are making it official, I don't really see a problem with that. But then you hear about organizations ""embracing"" remote work that also [won't let working mothers care for their kids](https://www.thelily.com/florida-state-just-barred-many-employees-from-caring-for-kids-while-working-remotely-moms-ask-what-am-i-supposed-to-do/) during work hours and, well, it's clear they just don't get it. 

## Remote as an office equivalent to remote as a way of work

Perhaps the greatest shift in remote work conversations I've seen is about the concept itself. For years, remote work was seen as an alternative to the office, or a virtual version of the office. This is half-true in the sense that work is done in an office and remotely, but it misses the point of the story. 

What I'm seeing now (which aligns to how I think about remote work) is that people are beginning to understand remote is a *way of work*, not an office equivalent. It's not a cure-all for office woes. It has its own problems. It's not perfect. But it has some amazing benefits as well that the in-office model can't replicate, particularly around freedom of location. 

Personally, I am really happy the ""remote work is just a virtual office"" mantra is on its way out (though COVID gave it a little bump from March to May 2020). When something is held on a pedestal as either a copy or a saviour, it cannot go anywhere and it cannot grow. Remote work is not perfect - and that was never the point. Remote work is a fundamentally different way of work, and people deserve the option to choose it (or not) for themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/i00lwo/the_changing_ways_people_talk_about_remote_work/,1596028922.0,8,131,WorkOnline

4j1hh9,"PSA: Babbletype is hiring for remote/work-from-home transcription, at $30-48 per hour of sound.","**I have exactly zero affiliation with Babbletype.**

I subscribe to a freelance writing newsletter, which lists remote writing opportunities. In the most recent edition, there was a listing for transcription work through Babbletype.

**[Here is a link to the Craigslist post.](http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/wri/5573528231.html)**

This isn't the kind of job I'd generally apply for, but I thought that people over here might be interested, so I figured I'd share.

Just a note: if you're new to paid transcription work, the rates listed are per hour *of sound*, not per hour. So the pay isn't as high as it looks on first glance, but to my knowledge, it should still come out to something pretty reasonable.

**EDIT**: I've never worked for Babbletype, nor have I done remote online transcription work. As such, I'm not the person to ask if you have any further questions about the position. I don't know anything except what's in their Craigslist post.

**EDIT 2**: /u/Alaaaah did the math, and estimated that it would probably come out to about $7/hour. This isn't as much as I would have thought, and it's low enough that it's not worthwhile for me personally, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be a decent opportunity for some of you out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/4j1hh9/psa_babbletype_is_hiring_for_remoteworkfromhome/,1463070157.0,24,82,WorkOnline

I hope you're all doing well! I come seeking your valuable advice and expertise on finding remote job opportunities in my field.  
A little about myself: I hold a Master's degree in Notary from Indonesia, and my passion lies in legal documentation and ensuring the validity of important documents. However, my journey has led me to Germany, where I am currently residing. I've been exploring the idea of transitioning to a remote job, which would allow me to leverage my skills and experiences while adapting to the German work environment.  
As you can imagine, the job market is quite different here, and I am still trying to understand how to best approach this transition. That's where I turn to you, the Reddit community, for advice. I have a few questions that I hope some of you might be able to help me with:  
Remote Job Opportunities: Do you know of any companies, platforms, or websites that offer remote job opportunities for individuals with a background in notary or legal documentation? Any specific websites I should focus on during my job search?  
Networking: Are there any online communities or forums that are popular among professionals in the legal field? I would love to connect with others who share similar interests and possibly gain insights into remote work opportunities.  
Required Certifications or Additional Education: Are there any specific certifications or additional education that you would recommend to enhance my chances of securing a remote job in Germany or even internationally?  
Language Requirements: While my English is proficient, I'm curious if there is a strong demand for notary services in other languages in Germany or any other countries, which could open up additional remote job possibilities.  
Tips and Advice: If you have any general tips or advice for someone like me who is looking to embark on a remote job search with a notary background, I'd be extremely grateful to hear them!  
Your collective wisdom and support can make a significant difference in shaping my future career path. I'm open to exploring various avenues and would love to hear about your experiences or any success stories in finding remote jobs with a similar background.

jifr0y,Looking for part-time remote job (not gigs),"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I'm college educated, but only have an associates degree for now. Thought about going back to school but want to get my foot in the door with work.

&#x200B;

I've tried my hand applying for traditional call centers like Maximum Research, BR Interviewing... etc. Those are traditionally sales and/or those political survey interviews, and a lot of people these days think you're calling to scam. Some people simply just won't do them, and they got this quota... I just got denied by BR Interviewing.

&#x200B;

I was looking on this sub and found Workbrite. Is that basically like Indeed but for exclusively WAH jobs? What do you get with a subscription? I assume you keep the subscription as long as you're still looking for a job/haven't been hired?

&#x200B;

I'm all for call center work, but give me a job working for, say, tech support helping people with their Spotify questions or something, I don't know how I feel about that survey stuff. Chat support agent also sound appealing from WOrkbrite. A support job where I don't have to actually talk to people on the phone sounds nice. I'm not against talking to people on the phone, mind you.

&#x200B;

So Workbrite is one site but if anyone has any other suggestions feel free to chime in here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/jifr0y/looking_for_parttime_remote_job_not_gigs/,1603723272.0,38,138,WorkOnline
oj67vu,Are there any agencies that would help with finding remote positions?,"I've seen some people say they've had success with finding remote positions. I would prefer to work from home and have been regularly checking LinkedIn among other sites for such work to not much avail. 

As far as my background goes I have:

-An English degree.

-3.5 years of teaching English in Japan. (I've looked into teaching online, but it wouldn't be enough to pay rent and my experience with the one company I applied to wasn't that great).

-JLPT N3 Certification (conversational Japanese which hasn't amounted to much success in job hunting obviously though I have gotten a few interviews because of it and other experience.)

-Almost two years working as an office admin/data entry/IT support (current job).
 
-Experience hosting my own podcast, managing multiple blogs (personal projects), and SEO optimization via targeting long-tail keywords and the like. 

I feel like there has to be something out there I can do. One thing I want to avoid are really bad call centers. Having worked in a bottom-feeding cesspit of a call center in tech support before it was hell in the office and I couldn't imagine the hell it would be working from home. 

That said, I technically work at a call center right now (though it doesn't feel like one) so I know good ones exist... but finding one is like looking for a needle in a haystack of needles.

[The last time we hired off Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/30y3zi/were_hiring_at_4patientcare_awesome_remote_jobs/) it worked pretty well, so we're back again! Check us out at [4PatientCare.com](http://4patientcare.com)

&nbsp;

We are currently hiring for the role of Technical Support Agent for our medical SaaS company (we are looking for multiple people for this position). Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

&nbsp;

A little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions. This is a place for people who are willing to take on any challenge that comes their way. ""That's not in my job description"" is not a phrase we believe in. We're more of an ""I'll figure it out!"" kind of team. Transparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve. We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team.

&nbsp;

What you can expect:

* This is a full time position: Must be able to work 7-8 hours a day between the hours of 6AM-6 PM Pacific time.
* Starting pay is $16/hour while in training. The initial training period is a minimum of 90 days. Once out of training, pay increases to $18/hour.

&nbsp;

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively.
* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art?
* A knack for staying organized. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day?

&nbsp;

* Must be a US citizen.
* Must be fluent in English
* Must have a computer and a working Internet connection.

Check us out at 4PatientCare.com.

&nbsp;

We are currently or soon to be hiring for a number of positions. These positions are limited to people residing in the following states:  AL, CA, CO, FL, NC, NV, NY, PA, TX or UT.

&nbsp;

Below is the job spec for the role of Technical Support Agent (the application for Technical Support Agent has been closed).

For all of our positions we offer competitive pay, good benefits, the ability to work remotely, and great opportunities (hello growing company!).

&nbsp;

Okay, back to the Technical Support Agent. Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

&nbsp;

A little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions.

Transparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve (here are our [Glassdoor ratings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-4PatientCare-EI_IE760463.11,23.htm)). We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team. 

&nbsp;

Also don't be fooled, we're not a startup. We've been in business for nearly 20 years delivering more happiness to healthcare.

&nbsp;

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively. We do not micro-manage and we do not hand-hold. We strike a balance between giving enough training and direction so that you're not totally in the shark tank without a life vest, but oftentimes it'll be up to you to be proactive to problem-solve and get. things. done. If you're lost and without a map, do you wait for someone to notice and show you the way or do you actively reach out to get the direction you need to move forward?

* A natural curiosity and a strong desire to learn. Do you thirst for knowledge and yearn to explore the unknown? Do you like to know how things are put together and what makes them tick?

* The ability to roll with the punches in a dynamic work environment. Do you welcome change and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing setting?

* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art? Is an upset client someone you fear or just another opportunity to turn someone's frown upside down?

* Strong organization skills and attention to detail. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day? Can someone throw ten tasks at you with specific instructions for each and trust that everything will get done and get done right?

&nbsp;

The main responsibilities of 4PatientCare Technical Support Agents include, but are not limited to:

* Setting up new clients and existing clients with their requested services.

* Assisting with basic pricing changes that occur when clients request changes to their current services.

* Taking incoming communications to support existing clients regarding issues, bugs, feature requests, and feedback.

* Engaging with customers about those issues, bugs, and feature requests and managing expectations about when everything will be resolved.

* Quantifying the importance of those issues/bugs, measuring feature request frequency, and advocating for the fixes users are finding most troublesome.

* Understanding the direct impact our services and service have on our clients, and within the confines of our system, doing everything possible to benefit clients' businesses.

* Creating and updating support documentation as processes improve.

* Assisting and training on tasks and areas that you have become proficient in.

I've tried micro jobs and been looking at regular jobs, but can't seem to find anything. Ideas? Just want $100+/week.","**Before you tell me to be careful or that I'm doing something illegal,** don't worry, I can do whatever I want at my current job as long as I do the work that's required of me that day. My bosses have literally come over to tell me something while I was playing video games or watching Netflix and they don't give a shit. I'm also alone 85% of the time except for the maintenance workers. So seriously, don't worry about it.

- Goal: Earn $100+/week while also working my current job.
- Hours: Preferably less than 20, but open to any as long as it works out.
- Days: Preferably during the day, anytime between Wed-Sun. Mon/Tue negotiable depending on the job.

Now, the only things I couldn't do would be take phone/video calls because at my current job one of my main tasks is answering the phone. Beyond that, the sky's the limit.

I've tried micro jobs and stuff listed on r/beermoney, but it's pathetic. Taking surveys, transcription, watching ads.....I make like $5/day, *maybe*. I got rejected from Allegiant and mTurk, two of the few micro jobs that seem to actually pay ok. I can type 70-90wpm.

I've been scouring Indeed and Craigslist, and actually made an honest attempt at filling out my LinkedIn profile for the first time. I thought I could easily get a remote **Customer Service** gig, but they all seem to be either Sales jobs disguised as CS jobs, or require answering phone calls. I've looked into Live Chat CS gigs but they don't seem to exist, except in conjunction with phone/video calls.

I'm already in the process of working on something that might bring passive income, but that probably won't give me more than 3 figures per month, *if* that. It might not ever bring me money but we'll see (it also won't be implemented until a couple months from now). So I'm racking my brain trying to figure something out while still applying to the odd CS/Assistant job I can find that seems to fit what I'm looking for.

I am looking for a remote Junior web developer role that pays a minimum of $6/hour. I have applied to many remote positions through LinkedIn and Angel.co (around 200) but I have not had any luck so far.

So I was wondering if it is actually possible to land a junior remote position from outside the US. And if it is possible, what can I do to land such a Job and what am I lacking?

I am Junior React developer with full-stack M/PERN (MySQL/MongoDB/PostgreSQL,Express.js, React.js, Node.js) experience.

In the back end, I worked with the Prisma ORM (for talking to the database), Zod ( for Typescript-based schema validation), and Postman (for API testing).

I have also used Python for Machine Learning and Deep learning with Scikit learn and Tensorflow libraries respectively.

Still need associated degree or experience.

64v4yr,I created Remote-Jobs.io - A tool for finding remote jobs on Craigslist (x-post /r/digitalnomad),"Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share a little side project that I whipped up a couple weeks ago. [Remote-Jobs.io](http://remote-jobs.io/) is a remote work/jobs search engine that taps into Craigslist job postings from all over the world.

Back when I was freelancing + looking for jobs, I relied on WeWorkRemotely.com and RemoteOK.io for finding remote work. While I love both those sites, I still wanted to find more listings. After scouring the web, I quickly realized that Craigslist was an untapped goldmine of remote job opportunities. This is because employers will post ""telecommuting ok"" jobs in their own city's Craigslist site, and many qualified coders/designers from other cities never see those listings! Remote-Jobs.io solves this issue by allowing people to search every city of Craigslist for remote OK jobs.

Remote-Jobs.io will eventually evolve into a full-fledged remote jobs search engine that searches more than just Craigslist. This is only V1, but I'm sharing it because it's already quite helpful + it provides a new source of remote job listings that's currently not easy to access. I hope you enjoy it & I look forward to your thoughts!

18ivssw,"x/100: Remote Data Entry (ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn) Legitimacy Rate","Hi,

When you get a moment:

I have recently (past 10 days) been applying to a variety of remote data-entry jobs on ZipRecruiter and have gotten some considerable activity on them.

Question 1: how legit are these jobs? x/100: for every 100 posts, are 40% scams? 60%? 80%?

I can type at about 50-60 wpm and basically live in front of the computer (which is a disaster in all honesty, but the absolute truth). I get the notion from the correspondence that I have had with these ""organizations"" that some of these are ""scam-ish"". I.e., they want to contact you via the Signal messaging platform and are offering text-messaging interviews (i.e. no phone calls or Zoom introductions). The objective is 25 / hr, basic momentum cash flow. *Nothing more* at this time. Trying to start ""as low as possible"" behind the computer in a remote capacity to gain traction.

Question 2: is data-entry not the right move here?

Of course, this all may sound extremely naive, given the fact that I have been behind this machine for 20 years and have yet to truly earn behind it. That said,

Question 3: in your experience: where / what role is a solid place to start? (Tend to perform better with ""task-oriented"" type of work with limited talking; unsure if this is relevant or not.)

What are your thoughts? Any insight / advice / experience is greatly appreciated.

Best regards!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/18ivssw/x100_remote_data_entry_ziprecruiter_linkedin/,1702630304.0,11,20,WorkOnline
b4lezo,Remote Work Links,"Hey, everyone! Don't know if I can do this since I'm new but I was reading through this reddit while going through my list of links I had saved for some places that hire remote workers, etc. I can't work with any of these companies since they either still don't accept hires from my state or require landline which I don't have in my current place, so I figured I'd dump the list somewhere that it may help someone else.

&#x200B;

I don't remember any of the information about the jobs I listed. Some are well-known companies, others I researched at the time I made the list, which was two or more years ago. So if you need to know anything about the jobs, read their sites and do your own homework.

18s4n1f,Seeking spam removal remote gigs in Florida,"Hi

I have been working for Appen awhile, since 2017. But Covid years slowed things wayyyy down. Now things have only slightly picked up there, with microtasking in October & November. Still waiting on paid invoices for those, as I had to order a new card due to mine that expired back in early summer.

LLM gigs have been all the rage this year, & I want to try my hand at those. Did go thru some qualifying with Appen & a few of their competitors for those. Some didn't let me quite pass their quizzes. Others if they passed have not loaded tasks yet. They say in 2024 they'll begin, but me like many others keep getting strung along with promises of work, that never seems to come! (Next Week, Next month, etc. they say -- but that time comes & goes & STILL, NO WORK )

And I also love to scout spammers in social media -- in a DIRE need of a gig doing that, I'm great at doing that!! Because not only do I Report/Block/Delete -- I'll take it a step further & send the contact info (if I can find it, researching where the accounts are from, or where the IPs & MAC addresses are found) & send that to law enforcement authorities!

Before you advise - please read this first! --

I tried freelancing sites before (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer etc. ) & those never got me any customers.. 

I tried UHRS & MTurk microtasking recently too, these are only worth pennies apiece & their screeners never get any paid work. 

I've done the surveys things as well, which screeners mostly disqualify me for almost everything. 

I tried playing games for side hustles, those were all scammers too! Most once you reached the payout threshold - had blocked me from getting them, EVERY. TIME.

I JUST WANT A FUN REMOTE JOB that pays well - something worth the several hours per day put in, that I'll enjoy -- NOT SCAMMERS PLEASE & THANKS !!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/18s4n1f/seeking_spam_removal_remote_gigs_in_florida/,1703694633.0,1,0,WorkOnline

162uxcp,"27-Year-Old Physiotherapist Aspiring to Become a Digital Nomad: Looking for Advice on 100% Remote, Stress-Free Jobs with No Degree Requirement","Good morning,

I'm 27 years old and currently work as a physiotherapist, living in Paris although I'm Italian.

I would like some practical advice. I plan to stay in France for another five years to study osteopathy and save up money to buy a house in Italy. However, my goal is to have a 100% remote job that allows me to live anywhere in the world, working solely from a PC.

I aspire to a digital nomad lifestyle, and in these 5 years while I'll be in France, I'm willing to use my free time to acquire the necessary skills for such a job, which I know it will almost surely be in an unrelated field to mine. 

The job should be:

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.

. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated

. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study

. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

. As stress-free as possible

Which path should I pursue?

sg5hmy,Strategy for reducing tax in a remote job - Europe,"Hi,

I'm working remotely for a tech international company (Ireland based). I'm under a contract with the company, so not self-employed, but the company don't care where I am based in Europe.

For the last 4 years, I'm based in Spain due to a relationship with a Spanish partner, but recently the relationship ended.

My Salary is quite high by European standards - 150K EUR a year, and I pay quite high tax in Spain (deducted automatically from my Salary), around 60K EUR tax a year,

**I thought that potentially I can move to another European country to lower the tax obligations, and from my new home, I can travel to different countries, etc.**

Few things to note:

\- I don't have an EU passport, I have only a Spanish resident (due to my relationship), so I can only go to places that give digital nomad visas or allow non-EU-passport holders to stay there.

\- Going outside the EU will be complex, because my company do have an entity in Europe, and if I'll move to another country, not in EUR, they will probably start re-negotiate the contract.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/sg5hmy/strategy_for_reducing_tax_in_a_remote_job_europe/,1643534711.0,6,2,WorkOnline

lro6dt,5 Skills To Master For Landing Your Dream Remote Job,"Do you yearn for an intellectually stimulating job without the over-stimulation of life in the US, SA and around the world?

Have you had a taste of working from home and are ready to trade in your suit and office commute for pajamas and Zoom meetings?

There are so many reasons why remote work can be a transformative experience for employees and employers alike: from increased productivity and flexibility in where you live to more time with loved ones.

Yet, with all those benefits comes new challenges to overcome. New ways of communicating, new technologies, and distributed time-zones to name a few. While organizations learn how to manage remote work policies, people looking to go remote need to focus on standout skills to get noticed in a global applicant pool.

So what skills should you focus on to stand-out and land that dream remote job?



TECH-SAVVY

Basic understanding of technology is the new barrier to entry for remote working even if you do not have a tech-focused job. Everyone is tired of one of the top questions of 2020 ""Can you hear me now?"" when logged on Zoom, or having to even explain what Zoom is to begin with.

To execute work effectively in a remote environment you need to feel comfortable using the appropriate tools.

How can I improve?

Common tools to get familiar within the remote landscape include Zoom, Slack, Notion, and Asana. Choose a few favorites and start moving your personal life into these tools. For example, you can create an Asana to manage your To-Do Lists and use Slack to connect with friends and family. Remember practice can go a long way when getting comfortable with new technology.

If things like 2FA and VPN are gibberish to you, brush up on your knowledge of privacy and security online. Creating strong passwords and downloading a password manager is a great starting point.

How can I show this skill off?

Add the tools you are most comfortable using to your LinkedIn profile and CV. Consider sharing your work in a public Notion, acting as a portfolio of your accomplishments. Ask about the tools and tech stack at the companies you are interviewing for.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS

Without the chance of running into your colleague at the coffee machine, or the subtleties of decoding a smile and a smirk, your virtual communication becomes critical.

As communication moves asynchronously, it is important to focus on written communication skills to increase readability of your messages.

How can I improve?

Learn your communication style, and considr ways you can flex to other styles. Start writing messages with a work context in mind. Record yourself on video calls and analyze ways to become more relaxed and engaging on camera.

How can I show this skill off?

From initial contact to final interview, you have many opportunities in the hiring process to stand out. Check that your written messages are concise. Share the most important information, and set clear expectations on next steps. Be authentic during video interviews and let your personality shine through!

TIME MANAGEMENT

Balancing work and kids, pets, and time zones can be a challenge for remote workers. Without the commute to break up the workday it is easy to let work expand into more hours of your day. An effective remote worker is an efficient remote worker. By prioritizing productivity over hours in front of a screen you can accomplish your goals with more time back in your week.

How can I improve?

Create a time management diary. List your top priorities, and all other tasks and meetings. Analyze your estimated time to complete, and your actual time to complete. Over time (pun intended) you will begin to see what traps you are falling victim to. From there, you can plan a schedule to complete your most important and urgent activities first.

How can I show this skill off?

When emailing with Hiring teams share your availability and time zone. Communicate expected turnaround time for your responses. Share examples of work you have completed with dispersed teams. During interviews discuss your approach to scheduling in focus time, meetings, etc.

It helps if you have previous telephone customer service experience, as well as knowing how to troubleshoot your PC if something is wrong with it.

bx0dj8,I am really looking for some hope in this remote work environment.,"Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm really having the good leads on an employer that would want to take under their wings a person like me. I am someone who's desperately looking for home-based jobs but I'm not someone who's a developer or great in sales or marketing. Since I do not have the experience, probably some employers are not open to newbies like me, but I can prove that I'm a fast learner and I'm really enthusiastic in doing my job. I do know some skills there, such as SEO link building as I was a content writer for the past few weeks of being a freelancer but a lot of sketchy and short-lived jobs have been given to me. I was actually a corporate worker for 3-4 years and recently, I quit my job to have a better and healthier environment. For my work experience I was a Researcher Analyst, a Compliance Assistant, an Administrative Assistant and I've been in the Customer Service industry for 6 months (non-voice/email support) for a gaming account.

&#x200B;

I really am open to any legit work that does not involve paying for training or something else and as much as possible would not require a noise-cancelling headset because at the moment, I don't even have the money to buy one. I am hoping someone could really give me leads to data entry or virtual assistant work that doesn't involve calling that much. I've already been to a lot of freelancer sites but sadly, I still don't have a job. Here are some of the sites I've already tried:

RatRace

Upwork

Onlinejobs

AngelList

&#x200B;

I've also tried LionBridge and Appen but I'm waiting on that but I'm hoping for more recommendations as well. I also am from the Philippines so I think it narrows down the search.

&#x200B;

If anyone wants to train me for any work ( even if it involves sales or marketing) or let me test a program that you've done and could pay me for quality testing then I'll be willing to do that too.

&#x200B;

Hopefully, someone can help me because I'm desperately needing money as this will help me in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/bx0dj8/i_am_really_looking_for_some_hope_in_this_remote/,1559724594.0,13,5,WorkOnline

My boss had called and said he'll be sending some emails throughout the day to go through what to download and things like that...but I really have nothing going on until 1.

My question is, am I on the clock right now? For those hours 9-1 when all I'm really gonna do is a few downloads here or there? They stressed these shifts, I'm just wondering if they'll like only pay me for my training from 1-3, or if I'm on the clock fully.

If you're curious about what types of roles are posted or what ""support focused"" means: roles will range from Customer Success, Customer Support, Technical Support, Support Engineer all the way to Director of Operations. The common theme is that the jobs are focused on supporting customers in some way, be it through simple service or more technical roles.

fsxypd,Hiring Remote Workers Throughout Business Closures.," I plan to start businesses and provide online income opportunities throughout the COVID19 disruptions by partnering with people who can provide services that will sky rocket in demand. In this post I will outline the types of opportunities and timeline for these becoming available.

**Week 1 - 2:** Commission based jobs for people who can generate clients for products and services.

This sort of business is easy to run since the costs of paying you come from the profits of the business. This makes the time to launch much quicker. Income opportunities can be offered without any risk on my part. When you help to make money you are paid a commission on that. Some commissions may be recurring depending on the nature of the product/service.

**Week 3 - 4:** Paid to post jobs.

Low paying jobs that will help the promotion of new businesses. These will pay fixed incomes but they will not be that much. Through this time the businesses aim to build up client bases/cash flows to become self sustainable, so overheads need to remain low.

**Week 5 - 6:** Customer service and community management jobs.

By mid month two some income from the efforts of weeks one and two should be starting to show and there will be more available for staffing. At this point better fixed income jobs will be available. These will be paid at whatever rate is viable, so it may start lower but increase as business picks up.

**Week 7 - 8:** Content production and brand ambassador jobs.

By now the fundamental systems to run the business well should be in place. An upgraded version of the paid to post jobs can be offered. This will pay people to produce content (blogs/videos/images/etc) for ongoing brand awareness promotion. These jobs will be paid with a basic rate with performance bonuses on top.

**Week 9 - 10:** Managerial roles.

Hopefully by this point there is too much going on to personally oversee all areas. If there is, there should be a decent amount of cash flow available for advanced jobs. Supervisor role, HR and project management sort of positions will become available. These will also be paid at a rate that is viable, so may start lower. The initial time for this would be a training period and then rate of pay increasing as you become self reliant in the position.

**Week 11 - 12:** Depends on what's happening.

This is around the time we may start to get indications of how bad the real effects from COVID19 may be. In an optimistic scenario around this time things may be difficult but there will be an end in sight and normality can resume. Beyond the virus itself the economic issues caused by all that has occurred could take a lot longer to get back to normal.

It is easier to bail out an immediate problem then work out an underlying problem, and it is easier to close a business than open one. If businesses are unable to open the job market is going to swamped. Supply/demand can lead to lowering of wages and it being far harder to get these lower wages. This may be the start of harder times which can be more enduring.

I hope this does not happen, but it is possible. So while I hope for better I am going to start to prepare to be in a strong position if this the case in a few months time (A long time. Remember a month ago it was all okay?). If unemployment gets high I should be able to set up various ""Get paid to"" type of online incomes which I will run at break even to offer maximum income for as long as is required.

If things improve after only a short period of time there will be some changes to some businesses, as is required, but they will still continue to run. So ongoing income opportunities are available in any case.

I have to be a bit vague on the products and services the businesses will offer at this point since many of the things I am looking at doing are relying on partnerships. I am still doing due diligence to ensure quality of things before making any decisions on what to go with. I'll elaborate on this as things move on.

The time-line for the launch and building of these businesses is a tight one. Ideally things would be a bit more spaced out, but everything is happening right now. Working fast and hard for a good solution today is better than an excellent one next week. Much of the success of this will hinge on me finding good people to work with to power stage one (commission sales). Focused, driven and determined people that make things happen. I'm one of these people and I know there are others out there. Those who help me get this going I will reward disproportionately when things pick up.

The effects of COVID19 on the future job market are at this time hard to predict, but bad could easily turn into terrible. I'd urge those of you who have the wherewithal to create jobs for people to begin to work on doing that. For those who are out of work, it'd be a good idea to work on improving skill sets that will make you more valuable to online business owners.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/fsxypd/hiring_remote_workers_throughout_business_closures/,1585740266.0,39,11,WorkOnline

what I need advice about is what can i do to stand up for recruiters and where can i find possible postings for such jobs. I'm willing to take entry level and junior level jobs because even those pay significantly higher than what I earn and I'll be overqualified for such positions. i also don't mind part time jobs, i even prefer them over full time.

pl7vf3,Writing Job - Remote - Ecommerce - Advertising & Marketing,"## Job details

**Salary** From $45,000 a year

**Job Type** Full-time

**Number of hires for this role**1

## Qualifications

* Copywriting: 1 year (Required)
* US work authorization (Required)

## Full Job Description

**Copywriter**

Does this sound like you?

* You fall asleep with a book in one hand and a pen you use to fix typos in the other hand.
* Your friends accuse you of being the 'grammar police', and you say, 'No; I'm a grammar Navy Seal.'
* You take pleasure in making readers cry at your short stories, social media captions, and emails. Then, you make them laugh five seconds later.
* If you blindfolded one of your prolific readers and spun them around three times, the reader would still be able to pick out your article on the wall among hundreds of others articles just because your writing voice was that strong.

If you read this list and said, ""It's like they wrote my biography,"" then you might be the worthy one we've been looking for to lift Thor's hammer.

**Just One Dime** is made up of invested and talented people that are passionate about helping online entrepreneurs obtain financial freedom so they can do what they love with the people they love. Just One Dime is growing aggressively and needs writers to help grow our library of content.

Here's a sample of the qualities we value:

**Tested Skill**:  
We need a writer who has already gone through their growing pains. You've humbly received feedback from fellow writers and editors and applied it. You can learn more about our business and ecommerce, but you must already know how to write a compelling ad, email, script, and social media copy. And yet, you remain teachable.

**You Take Action**:  
If you don't know about any particular bit of being an online entrepreneur or how the industry works, then you will seek the answers out. If you have a problem, you will seek out the solution. To you, there are no dead ends.

**You Take Pride in Your Work:**  
When you send out any completed assignment, you can look at it and say, ""This represents how good of a writer I am."" To you, tasks are more than tasks; they're opportunities for you to make a statement about your skill. You take ownership of every bit of writing you do.

**Good Human**: We're building a team of people that respect each other, who build others up, are humble, teachable, and make us laugh. You must be able to take feedback with humility and a thick skin.

If everything you have read so far feels right and you meet the requirements below, let's talk.

**What We're Gonna Have You Do** (at least some of the things)

* Work directly with the Content Manager to produce marketing emails, blogs, scripts, social media captions, and more that will grab readers by the horns and keep their attention.
* Create opportunities for Just One Dime to expand its reach. When you write, you will think of all the ways we can repurpose the material in creative ways, so that we all work smarter, not harder.

**What You Already Bring to the Table** (at least some of the things)

* One to five+ years of marketing and copywriting experience with a strong emphasis on digital, social media (especially Youtube and Facebook), and email marketing. You might be able to sneak in with less paid experience, but then your portfolio better melt our faces off with how excellent it is.
* Experience in writing with a brand voice and the ability to chameleon your writing style from media to media.

9wwf6j,"The city of Tulsa, OK is offering a $10,000 grant and other benefits to remote workers willing to move to the area","This came across my Twitter feed tonight, and I thought that it might interest some people here.

The city of Tulsa is offering $10,000 to remote workers willing to move to the city. There are other benefits, including:

* Free housing stipend for fully-furnished apartments in the heart of the city, plus utilities covered for 3 months
* Free co-working office space
* A local community ""designed"" to be supportive of remote workers

The requirements are:

* 18+ years old
* Eligible to work in the US
* Must be a full-time remote employee or self-employed outside of Tulsa County
* Can move to Tulsa within 6 months
* edit: Must be willing to live in Tulsa for at least 1 year

There also appears to be some sort of interview process involved, it's not an automatic approval.

For more information and to apply, [check it out](https://tulsaremote.com/#hero).

Personally, this seems to be targeted at those working in the tech industry, since remote workers are usually working in that sector. That makes sense, I know that Tulsa has been making a push to be more attractive for tech companies. I actually live 2 hours from Tulsa, so I'm sort of considering it.

9xbtmv,I Have Created Periodix - Remote Jobs with Hiring Prediction,"Hey there!

I apologize in advance if this type of post is unacceptable in this sub.

**However...**

So I've developed this website for about a year. It's called [Periodix](https://periodix.net/), Artificial Intelligence that searches or browses jobs from all over the web for you. It shows projects with the highest chances to be hired for you.

**Main Purpose:**

\- It finds remote or otherwise flexible jobs from all over the web leveraging AI

\- It saves your time for searching projects for your profile.

\-You see the possibility of being hired on a job.

**Website features:**

\- Google Chrome Extention for getting new updates faster;

\- Jobs without scams. Periodix analyses all projects and it shows real projects for you;

\- You save your time for searching because of everything in one place;

\- You can filter jobs for your interests, budget, and country;

\- Periodix shows projects for your location;

\- You can teach the algorithm if a project isn't for your skills.

**Note on the above:**

We continue to add new job boards. You can get more projects every month.

**A few limitations:**

\- The website IS NOT PERFECT.

\- Since this is largely an aggregator, you may occasionally see some repeat entries, or even NON-remote jobs. That's why you can teach the algorithm for making it better.

**Some fun / useless facts, in case this matters at all:**

You save up to 10 hours per week by getting a personal list of jobs that match your skills and have a high chance of hiring.

Please let me know if you encounter any thoughts.

I believe you find it useful.

j6h0ml,Is it possible to negotiate a remote position once the job offer is on the table?,"Hello!

I applied for a job thinking it was remote (or at least partially remote). The office is 1.5 hours away from where I currently live, and I have laid my roots here and don't really have any interest in relocating. I applied for the job because despite there being no mention of whether it was remote or not in the description, it popped up under ""remote"" on Indeed.

I had an interview last week that I thought I blew. She mentioned the role being in office a few days a week but that they were still ironing out the details. She asked if I would be open to commuting. I said yes, but mentioned winter weather potentially being a challenge (we live in the mountains).

Anyway, I thought that was that because I wasn't feeling very confident. I'm now entering the second round of interviews this week, and I can't remember if they'll either make the decision after this or if I'll have a third interview.

I'm worried about wasting their time, knowing realistically I cannot commute more than 1-2 days a week. But at the same point, it is more of a mid-level, higher salary, role... with COVID I know I can expect to be working remotely at least for a few more months. 

Do you think this is something I could negotiate should an offer be put on the table? Or should I bring it up again in the interview?

For context: it would be a graphic design position. I can see needing to come in for some things like providing art direction at product photoshoots for example. The company is small (25 people) but they do have a few people that live out of state and work fully remote.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/j6h0ml/is_it_possible_to_negotiate_a_remote_position/,1602030551.0,2,5,WorkOnline

btewvg,"Looking for some guidance, recommendations for remote work after a particularly awful day.","*(TL;DR version: I need a new job, but am feeling hopeless and am afraid of scams or anything not worth my time)*

I would like to apologize in advance if this post is a bit strenuous to read through, my brain isn't working at 100% right now and I'm looking for some help from the great folks on reddit.

Without getting too in-depth into my mental health history, let me just say it has been a bit of a rollercoaster. I've been prescribed various antidepressants and other medications. I've been misdiagnosed in the past. I've undergone various therapies.

That being said, I've been a top-performing sales consultant (nationally) at a few retail positions that I've held the last decade. My metrics at all my previous jobs have been good enough to always earn a raise come time for a review. My point being, I am a good and hard worker. I achieve and often exceed expectations. I know I can be a strong person.

But my brain doesn't let me enjoy a good thing for too long. It never does.

I've been struggling really badly for about two months now, and had already been considering going back on antidepressants prior to today's events.

Today, for the first time ever in my life, I had a severe mental breakdown at my new retail job, spoke with a manager, and quit with one hour remaining in my shift. I was already feeling overwhelmed from lack of any training of any kind and that I needed to ask so many questions. The straw that broke the camel's back was right at the beginning of my shift when one of the managers I had never met or heard of located me on the salesfloor, and began to unprofessionally scream commands at me, out of nowhere, while I was 10min into my shift and already doing the task that *my* direct manager had asked me to do while I was clocking in. I continued to work, now on this new task, feeling completely embarrassed, completely worthless, disposable, etc. My brain was telling me to walk out right away, but I thought I could last my whole shift. I was wrong, and now I have no job.

I have a 120-hour TEFL certificate, but no classroom experience.

I have a passion for writing, but have no academic achievements in the field nor any experience in writing as a job.

I've done transcription online and enjoyed it, but found I was spending hours upon hours of work for a quarter of what my province's hourly wage is.

I have interest in voice acting but also have no experience.

I seriously can't think of much else right now but I've also tried a few ""task-worker"" sites but none seemed to pay enough to cover any of my bills (if the site even offered CAD payouts). I'm at a loss and can't deal with scrolling through a list of sites that might all not be worth my time.

Basically, I'm broken and can't do retail anymore. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and moving forward with my health as best as I can. I love to work. I need to work. I just need a human response for my problem and was hoping I might find someone here who knows of any opportunity I might want to check out right away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/btewvg/looking_for_some_guidance_recommendations_for/,1558914089.0,9,13,WorkOnline

1. Skype: for team communication and video call if we really need it. Normally our team does not need to call much, but we may need to do so in the future for interview. My friend also recommended Zoom but honestly I'm not sure how different it is compared to Skype.
2. Todoist: to make my own to-do list. I've been trying this one out and so far it seems great. The interface is quite easy to use and I can connect them between my phone and laptop. Unfortunately its task Reminder feature is locked behind Premium package... which I'm not exactly need all of features included in it.
3. Trello: it works quite fine for now as project management tool. Its free plan is pretty generous, making it suitable for small teams like ourselves. Still I would hope to get more recommendations regarding project management.

I have been surfing through this thread for a while, trying to find the best thing that may suit me. Having said that, most of the websites that have been on top of the suggestion list so far are mainly made for those living in the US, the UK or some other European countries. It is even more super frustrating that even though some are proved to be an online job, yet after I completed filling in my personal details and doing some free training tasks, I figured out myself that there is actually nothing much to do based on my current location.

So yeah, as you can already guess, I am Asian and to be more specific, I am living in a SEA country. Please kindly give me some more recommendations on what I could take a look at. These are the websites that I have already done:  


**- Appen:** Appen is so weird for me.  It keeps sending out quite a few Emails reminding me of the available positions once in a while, yet even though I passed that round and also tried to apply for the opening projects, I have never heard anything from them. It is really difficult to reach out for them by Emails (I have no idea whether there are any other ways to contact them). I  technically give up on this site.  


**- UserTesting, TrymyUI, Test Worker:** I am qualified for all of them, yet it seems that there has been no tasks that really fit my database YET. I can see that there are so many people earning a lot out of them, so I am still giving some hope.  


**- Mturk, Microsoft Rewards, Prolific:** Sadly, they are not available in my area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/ctvy6l/remote_jobs_for_asian_people/,1566472535.0,9,5,WorkOnline

83bmn3,$300/mo. easy providing remote support through Loyal Techs,"I saw a post about a newcomer to the remote tech support scene and there was a lot of interest about it, so I figured I'd post this as well.

[Loyal Techs](https://www.loyaltechs.com/techs) (not a referral link) is a Boston-based startup that connects local and remote technicians to people looking for help with their technology. Most of the local work is hardware-related (e.g. setting up wi-fi or a printer) whereas the remote work is, out of necessity, software (e.g. install Microsoft Office for me, virus removal, etc.). The pay is 20+ bucks an hour so, although it won't make you rich, it's not a bad side gig. 20 hours a month nets you 300 bucks, minimum.

**Edit**: Here's a better breakdown of pay*:

**$15**/hr for Data Backup/Transfer

**$37.50**/hr for Software Install/Uninstall

**$56.25**/hr for New Computer Setup

**$60**/hr for Network Setup/Troubleshoting

You don't have to have a formal educational or professional background in tech. As long as you're the unofficial tech in all your family and friends' lives, you'll do just fine.

You get to work whenever you want, no set hours. Everything is through the app, from getting notifications of available jobs to accepting them to getting paid for them. It's available both on iPhone and Android.

Feel free to ask any questions about my experience!

Hey there,

I am seeking to hire approx. 80 inbound call center representatives. The job is fully remote, legitimate, no commissioned sales or sales of any kind, cold calling or outbound calls. Laptop will be mailed to you to use.

You will work M-F, 8am to 5pm. Hours are strict. No weekends. All government holidays off. Pay increase after 90 days, which will also include full benefits plus 401k. You will be working for the government, going over state medical plan prescription benefits.

Full/paid training.  You coworkers are nice, not a lot of micro-managing, you can schedule time off for appointments, days off, etc, with plenty of growth opportunity.

If you are interested, please reach out to me as I am hiring ASAP. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY. Don't waste my time and I will not waste yours, okay?

DM me, tell me a bit about your background and work experience. If I like you, you are pretty much hired.

The following states are excluded from this current job role: California, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Montana, Washington, DC, West Virginia, Connecticut, Ohio, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Washington and Massachusetts.

EDIT for clarity:

Edit: I find it extremely odd that so many people have downvoted a legitimate job offer. So let's recap, for those who seem unable to understand or are making false accusations.

1. This is a temp to perm position. You are hired via temp agency for a temp-to perm job. Your temp position with the temp agency lasts 90 days. If the company you are temping for (this government project job, MMC, Inc.), sees that you show up on time, and do your job, you will get hired for a perm position. That's it. United States ONLY, and please read the states that are excluded. I am hoping to have at LEAST 20-30 people screened and ready to hire BY MONDAY. But I still need up to 80.
2. The reason I am pre-screening for my friend, the hiring manager for the temp agency, is because I do a somewhat similar role in a non-qualifying state. As such, I would like to at least be able to speak with the individual I am recommending for hire, and determine if their ""phone presence."" is nice enough. It's that easy.
3. You need to pass a background check. Don't apply if you know you can't. Again, this is a government contract job. You are pulling info such as address/social security numbers, etc. As such, we want to make sure you aren't doing anything shady with the info.
4. If I like you and I think you are a good candidate, I will forward your resume along with any other details to the hiring manager. If you want to go over the job in further detail, you can ask her.
5. Please, please please do not ask me if we can adjust your schedule, or let you work weekends, or come in later or earlier. We do not set up the schedules. You are working government hours. Strictly 8-5, no weekends.  If you can work that schedule from M-F, then let me know. Again, this is U.S only, some states are prohibited.
6. I do have a job for Cali (we need 80 reps, somewhat similar role), for a job starting in Nov, potentially, but I don't have more details until next weekish, maybe.

As it stands, I still will be speaking with each potential hire, should you be interested. To make it clear again, I am helping her find new hire reps. I don't get paid for this, and I will not be responding to rude behavior. If you think this is a scam, then congrats. You talked yourself out a legitimate job, and that isn't my problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/ivi1oo/fully_remote_16hr_full_time_equipment_provided/,1600474998.0,20,0,WorkOnline

9pa1mk,3 challenges around sleep for remote workers (and how you can overcome them),"I've had conversations with professionals who work from home from all over the world so I could understand some of the struggles with sleep. From newcomers who are just getting started to seasoned veterans who have worked remotely for years, I've learned that there are some unique challenges with sleep. And as I continued to talk to more and more people who work online, I've discovered some patterns and common pain points with sleep.

# The flexibility of choosing when to work

One of the benefits of being a remote worker is flexibility around getting work done. For some, that can mean choosing their own hours or the location that they work from like a dedicated space in their home, a coworking center, or maybe a local coffee shop.

Here is how this flexibility was described in one conversation:

>""Because I can bring my work anywhere and anytime with me, I didn't follow a set schedule for work. Work can creep in even in family gatherings, dinners and even in bed.""

# Trouble with ""turning off""

With a regular 9 to 5, there is a distinction between when you are working and not working because you leave your home and go someplace to work. The commute can serve as a sort of time to decompress. When you work remotely from home, the lines of work-life balance can become blurred. 

Here is feedback from a remote professional about having trouble with winding down at night:

>""Running your own business and working from home requires a lot of discipline to avoid sleep issues. It is all too easy to stay up late, working on the computer, when the office is a few steps from the bedroom.""

# Unexpectedly waking up in the middle of the night

Waking up in the middle of the night occasionally is normal. Perhaps you drank a lot of liquids before bed, or maybe you had a stressful day. However, it becomes a problem when it starts to happen frequently where you are waking up exhausted the next morning from not sleeping well. The cycle becomes worst when you sleep in because you are tired, feel guilty from getting up late, and then work later and later to try to ""catch up.""

Here is how someone talked about this challenge:

>""I've been waking up almost every night around 3am, and I have trouble falling back to sleep, so I usually reach for my phone.""

# Recommendations on how to handle these challenges so you can sleep well

If you want to have restful sleep without feeling exhausted in the mornings, then one way to do that is to create a schedule as if you were working set hours such as a 9 to 5. The other part of this is being aware of how technology such as the blue light from screens can affect you and making some changes to reduce screen time at night.

\- Create a dedicated space in your home for work

\- Be intentional with your work schedule, so your hours remain stable from day to day

\- Use boundaries to avoid working on ""just one more thing"" late into the wee hours of the night, and so you have some personal time to relax

\- Enable night mode on your phone to minimize blue light after sunset. F.lux is a great option for your computer.

\- If you struggle with waking up in the middle of the night, then [try deep breathing for a few minutes](https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/psychological-emotional-wellbeing/Combat-Tactical-Breathing.pdf) instead of reaching for your phone. Deep breathing also works for staying in control under stressful situations.

Keep in mind that this isn't all or nothing. 

It's a journey so start with changing a couple of things. Then move on to the others later on when you are ready. The strongest resistance and discomfort will happen across the first few days, and it's also the period in which most people give up. If you are serious about getting a good night's sleep and waking up refreshed in the mornings, then it's absolutely worth it.

g1osbl,Create a Powerful Remote Workforce by Using These Softwares,"I am not sure if this belongs here, but I have found a list of tools to build efficient workflow, provided by kinda big guy in the Middle East project management scene. Thought you guys might find it useful.

By the way, the guy is running a webinar this week, covering topics of the PMP program. It's a nice deal for those who would like to get prepared for the exam, as it costs only $50 instead of $500 PMI's cost. https://ppmwebinar.caseinpointco.com/

So here's the soft he recommends: 


Team Collaboration Software: Sucoco

Sucoco simulates a virtual office-space with a laid-out blueprint of your ""office"", which allows you to see who's clocked in and who hasn't yet. Employees can change their status according to their availability, instant message each other using the integrated Slack app and also effortlessly conduct spontaneous meetings just by ""showing up"" in one virtual room and then simply enabling their microphones. You can even receive notifications when someone enters or exits your office.

Video Conferencing Software: Cisco Webex Meetings

We've discussed having a virtual office where you and your team can be in the same place at the same time, but what about hosting video conferences with those from outside your workforce? When you're trying got maintain the trust of vendors and clients, the last thing you need is lag and connectivity issues during your video call.

You can professionally send invites to meetings, chat with other team members within the software itself, share documents or applications during meetings and even integrate it with other apps like Trello or Google Drive for a more productive and seamless workflow.



Time Tracking Software: TSheets and BigTime

TSheets and BigTime allow you to see exactly how much time each employee is spending on a particular task or project, create invoice templates, track your budget, share work schedules and even allows you to assign tasks to employees with just a few clicks. The apps also provide progress reports that show you which tasks your employees are spending most of their time on, discrepancies in workflow and what needs to be done to fix that.

Content Collaboration: Google Drive and Dropbox

Keep your files in one, safe place and accessible anytime. Dropbox and Google Drive are two classic content collaboration software that never fails to deliver.

You can both share files internally and externally using these two software and grant access to specific users to certain files on the cloud. You can also access these files from any device you want. These two applications allow your staff to share, create, synchronize, upload and download files in real-time while also sharing work with people outside of your organization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/g1osbl/create_a_powerful_remote_workforce_by_using_these/,1586943333.0,9,100,WorkOnline

However I'm more into my personal writing assignments right now. Which is why I'm concentrating on full time CS jobs. Please help :) Thank you.

152x4m1,"We should call it Remote Work, not Work From Home","""Work from home"" sounds like something invented by the RTO crowd to make it sound like we're all just chillin in our jammies on the couch. I can easily understand why some people wouldn't want to work at home all the time and are averse to the concept of ""WFH."" But it's nonsense.   Remote work can still mean working in an office. it doesn't mean ""work from home."" it means ""work wherever the heck you want as long as you can still do your job.""

Realizing that if the task can be done on the computer than it can be done from just about anywhere on the planet is something managers and property investors are desperate for people to not grasp and making ""wfh"" the colloquial term serves that purpose.  I've been working remotely for 15 years. sometimes I rent an office, sometimes i work at the beach.

17zp6fl,Regret the return to office - remote work actually saved me more money,"I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

  
I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

  
I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it.

17mhvrd,115k 100% fully remote or 125k in office,"Hi everyone!

Right now I'm 100% remote and I make 115k in a HCOL area.

I'm working in software development in healthcare. I find the job incredibly boring. I was working in space/satellites before I made the transition to healthcare two years ago.

I've casually been looking for jobs back in space and I've made it through the final rounds interviews in a job that is in a research lab that develops software for satellites. I'm just waiting to hear back to see if I got the job.

Obviously the base salary difference isn't a big difference however this potential new company offers 25% of your salary into your 401k without any contributions on my end. I could potentially retire very early which has always been a dream of mine.

I'm getting cold feet about leaving my job. I love working from home but I don't see myself in this job forever and this opportunity sounds like a great step for my career.

In addition to the 25% to my 401k they offer health care through an IBA that's worth 25% of my salary. Any money I don't use that month on healthcare I receive back. My total compensation would be around 182k.

Just wanted to vent/ here others peoples thoughts.

I hope this was coherent!

The other week I was visiting my parents for a long weekend and would work from their guest room for one day. They have been retired for a few years but owned their own in-person business when they did work. They had an office and at one point 10  employees. Growing up, sometimes one of them would work from home and since they were the boss they still had some autonomy over their schedule. 

  
When I was taking meetings or in a flow they still would walk in and interrupt the meetings or my flow periodically throughout the day. Some meetings were with the  clients which through me off when interrupted.   
I explained to them numerous times to please not interrupt me while I am working. I tried to communicate that it should be like I am in an office and on a schedule as they did when they had to go into their business.

16djzph,How to be happy while WFH in a remote-hostile work environment,"I was hired post-Covid, as mostly WFH, in a senior position in an agency with 50 members of staff. Unlike most of colleagues, I live 200 miles from the office. 

I am one of the only remote employees left (the other three have either been fired or quit).

All staff have to go into the office four times a week and my boss asked me to go into the office three times a month (because of how far I live). I drive in and yes, it's a long commute. But it's a good job for me, in the sense that I enjoy the work. 

This arrangement has been going on for over a year and a half. The commute isn't the main problem here. 

The problem is that, as more people get hired into the office, my strange set-up becomes more and more... unusual. I feel like I have to keep justifying it to everyone, even though I work really long hours, I am really focused, and I do great work remotely. 

HR are openly anti-WFH, turning away any candidates who mention WFH or hybrid. They honestly despise remote workers, assuming them all to be lazy (probably because they can't WFH themselves tbh, and they assume no one can; either that or they're jealous. Or both.)

I've just gotten to the point of being sick and tired of people assuming I don't do as much as they do because I WFH, of people feeling jealous, of people being petty and purposely not including me in meetings (because doing it online 'isn't the same', etc.), of needing to always explain what I'm doing - to people who aren't my boss and assume I sit around all day, or feel like I owe them an explanation.

The irony of it all is that, while in the office, people waste so much time being unproductive!

My question is, what do I do?

Should I search for another job, one where I can WFH alongside a team who respect this and also work remotely? With a team who aren't catty and jealous and hostile to my setup? 

Part of me feels like I shouldn't care and if I do the job well, like the job, and my boss is happy that's all that matters. He hired me after all, and he and I get along well. But I also crave an environment where I don't have to constantly justify myself or 'perform' my productivity to others. Or feel like I'm going to be fired because they're so anti-WFH. 

This all said, perhaps I am in a grass is greener mindset. After all, all jobs have nasty people, jealous people, malicious people and ultimately it's up to oneself to decide what to care about.

17yyki5,"Currently Remote/WFH, Might be Moving","Advice needed.  I currently work a 100% remote role for a company that happens to have its HQ office about 45 minutes away from my home.  There are a handful of employees in this same boat.  I have been with the company 2 years, am a high performer, and am well-liked.  There is no requirement for ""locals"" to come work out of HQ, though many do drop in one a week or so.  I do not (with rare exceptions, like a holiday party or a baby shower) because I am infinitely more productive at home.  No one cares that I don't drop in.  My supervisor does care.  My department manager doesn't care.  Whee!

The trouble is, my partner does not WFH and was recently laid off.  He is job hunting and has reached the final round of interviews for a new position.  It feels like an inevitability that he will get this job.  The catch: we would have to move out of state if he takes this job.

I would like to keep my current job.

My company is, again, 100% remote and has employees located all over the country.  On top of that, there are already employees at my company working in the state where we would be headed.  I was hired as a remote worker with no expectation of being in the office despite being a ""local"" to HQ - they do encourage locals to come in but it is not mandatory and like I said before, no one has ever given me any grief for not coming in.

But if my partner gets this job and we start the wheels of moving, I'll have to let my company know that I will be relocating somewhere not-local.  Half of my team is located out of state so in theory I feel like this is not a problem.  In practice, I'm afraid that I will lose my job because there seems to be rumblings all over the place in this job market that companies want a RTO.  This would be impossible with my company given that we are all scattered around the country, but I'm afraid that my choosing to no longer be ""local"" will be frowned upon.

If my partner gets this job, what would be the best way to approach this conversation with my manager? The core message I want to deliver is ""I love working here and I would like to keep my job when we move, please let me do that because it wouldn't change anything about the way I work because I never come to HQ anyway."" (But more eloquent and professional than that.)

Conversely, a friend of mine who is a former employee of my company (was pushed out of her job due to shitty politics which is another story for another day) told me to keep my mouth shut, quietly move, maintain residency in my current state (which wouldn't be hard as we are not planning to sell our house, we are going to allow my cousin to move in with her family and I would be visiting a lot to see them and my friends here and would be working here occasionally). and see how things shake out.  This advice seems highly problematic.  However, she used to run payroll at my company for our hundreds of remote workers nationwide, so her advice isn't exactly uninformed.  On the other hand, she was pushed out of her job by a manager who had an agenda and it was really upsetting and she's understandably angry at the company and I know that is coloring her advice.

Another colleague who is a friend and works on my team currently in my same job function has also advised me to keep quiet if my partner gets the job.  She is not local to HQ.

I really feel like it's not smart to not say anything if we are moving but I honestly don't know if this is a problem if I am still technically maintaining a residence in my current home state.

What do I do?

And before anyone asks - I will always be the trailing spouse in my relationship because my partner out-earns me by 3x and that is not likely to ever change due to his experience and his industry.  I also, while I love my job, consider it to be a ""day job""/""health insurance job"" because I am a working musician and consider that to be my real career.  I just happen to have lucked into a day job that I genuinely enjoy and I don't want to lose that.  I don't have a ""career track"" in my day job's industry the way he does.

Any advice would be appreciated, especially if you are a manager who has been in this position with a remote-classified direct report who moved to a different state.

17zdhul,37.5 HRS in person/ADA vs 40 hr Work Week Permanent Remote,"When I started my job from the office, it's always been 37.5 hrs/week considered full-time salary. I went on ADA for several months, then COVID hit and everyone was WFH. Recently, they've been demanding folks go back into the office for -at minimum- hybrid; however, they've left those of us who were ADA alone. 

Last week, I finally received approval for permanent WFH; shortly thereafter, I received a separate email indicating my hours were now 40/week. 

I don't understand the difference and it's not explained in employee handbook. Thoughts? For reference, I'm in PA.

Edit: I'm unsure why there were so many downvotes when I gave truthful statements; this post wasn't seeking advice, but rather the logic of the difference. I've seen (via searches) a couple others ask the same question from time to time, but have never seen a solid answer. 

I neglected to mention I'm also 70% disabled veteran status, but those conditions weren't factored into the ADA accommodation, so I didn't think it was relevant. I also did speak with my boss (he's the one who mentioned even he didn't know why the hours changed). 

Solved! Anyway, for those interested, big thanks to u/vtinesalone for the suggestion to go back to the employee handbook. I was basing my original hours off my offer letter and also looking in an incorrect place in the handbook.

The employee handbook has been updated to include employee classifications that reflect hours based on location (such as home office +2 other locations) 37.5 and 40 (other locations) as Regular Full-Time,"" and they've added remote workers into their own category as 'all other locations and remote' as ""regular part time,"" so it looks like there's the logic I was looking for.

I am salaried exempt. My old job is the only remote job I had. They didn't care about tracking or hitting x hours as long as I was available during core hours and got my work done. This was perfect for my schedule since I typically drop off and pick up my baby when husband can't. 

Prior to accepting new job I was told the core hours and typical work week schedule.  New boss said I could start at 9. What I didn't know was that it meant making up those hours to hit x amount of hours each day whether it means working later evening, skipping lunch (which by policy is 45 min). If you run late from a doctor appt. you need to make it up later.. she seriously expected me to stay at the office until 6pm (when everyone usually heads home earlier) just  to hit my hours, but I negotiated to skip lunch. Everyone also announces when their lunch is running over, if they have a doctor appointment and when they will make up their time. They will send a group message, ' have a doctors appointment! Running a bit late but I will be making it up this weekend!' to the team. 

I feel uncomfortable announcing that. Old jobs, I just told communicate to my boss and blocked my calendar.

I hate reporting and feeling restricted and it's interfering with my life cuz then I only see my daughter 1.5 hours before bed time....

1ao1ncm,"Why everyone should cheer for remote work, even if you punch in on-site","Here's the deal:

- Traffic's a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won't feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we're not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread.
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can't work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless.

Advice/insight appreciated,"I recently started a position with a reputable, well known and trusted healthcare company that is hybrid 4 days a week WFH and 1 day a week in-office (conveniently located about 20 minutes away from my home). I was so relieved and excited to have gotten the job since it is a competitive position that I worked very hard for, and was looking forward to the change of pace as I've been going through the stress of IVF and recently discovered I am pregnant. I wanted to be in the comfort of my home in case I needed to frequently use the bathroom, give myself the IVF meds or suddenly feel the urge to puke. The job itself is also a perfect fit and my colleagues seem to be really great.
However, what I didn't factor in was that they are expecting me to train in-office, and there's a catch: I won't just be training at the office near my home where I'll be working, the other people in my position who are training me are located all around, in offices up to an hour away from my home. The traffic during rush hour coming home has been also been awful, yesterday an hour and a half, and has impacted my IVF medication schedule and causing tons of stress.
I am a very professional and reasonable person, and initially understood and did not at all mind coming in person to shadow and learn the new documentation system and work flow. But the other issue is that no one knows how long this will be going on for, since I still do not have access to the remote EMR after three weeks (I did the training already and access was requested by the manager) and they are essentially just having me shuttle around so I can be paid to do something.

I have virtually no stress for work. I have a very hands off boss and I'm very competent at what I do for only being a 1-year employee.

15upzgj,"When did ""remote"" on a job listing start to mean ""travel required"""," In my job search for remote work opportunities, I've noticed many listings mentioning required travel despite being labeled as remote roles. As a professional with relevant experience interested in fully location-independent work, I want to understand this trend better.

Is ""remote"" evolving to include regular travel between offices? Or do these roles not fully match my goal of finding a work-from-home position without a travel requirement? I'm open to learning more about the expectations and logistics. My priority is finding the right long-term fit where I can contribute my skills without routine travel disrupting my home life. Help me understand if these positions align with a true work-from-home arrangement? I'm optimistic but it defeats the entire point of a remote job if I still have to commute.

1arq4zr,Going from fully remote to a hybrid opportunity? What would you do?,"Has anyone moved from a fully remote to hybrid setup? My current job is fully remote with no chance of RTO (small startup) but I have a job offer for a hybrid position 3 days a week in-office with a \~45 min commute one way with expectation to attend some trade shows (4-5 a year). I lucked out with my remote role as a jr. The work isn't too bad but I feel very stagnant in my current role along with never really being offline since it's a startup. The job offer would be slight leg up with a 5k pay bump in a large company and industry I've been hoping to break into but the 3-days in office is really putting me in a bind. I don't have a car and live in a very HCOL area with no parking available even if I did get a car. One of my relatives works near the office so I'd be able to hitch a ride to the office but the way back home would have to be through public transport since said relative gets off earlier than me.

I've grown to appreciate the remote, flexible work structure and unlimted PTO at my current company and I also have an elderly dog that I want to stay with for as long as possible but I'm also wondering if I'm dooming myself career-wise by not taking a larger company role.

167cf9k,"Hired as a remote employee, being called to office without notice every week.","I'm currently extremely unhappy with my employer. I work for a university and my role is generally remote throughout different departments. I was hired as a remote employee as I live three hours away from the office. 

My manager has been micromanaging me to the extreme, she has to be CC'd on all emails and wants me to send an update every single day for tasks. She keeps calling me to the office in the middle of the week randomly for ""training"" purposes. It takes me 6 hours to do  commute for a 2 hour training session that can be done remotely. The training session consists of her making me sit on her computer and do menial tasks with her watching over me. 

I'm constantly under stress of commuting 6 hours to the office every week as she calls me whenever she desires and according to her schedule since she lives 15 mins away. I don't make a lot of money and a majority of it goes towards rent and commute. 

I've brought it up multiple times that the commute is causing me financial hardship and an entire day is wasted and I have to work additional hours in the week to catch up. She doesn't seem to understand my hardships and is very critical of everything I do. 

I'm dealing with so much stress. My last paycheck was not received and my manager decided to call me on Friday today and I finally refused. I've complied to all her in office requests but due to not receiving my paycheck , I just cannot afford to commute and plus I already have plans on babysitting my niece. 

I'm stressing out so much that she will say something when she doesn't see me in the office as even though I said I will not be able to come, she still insisted and I got way too annoyed and didn't even reply. There have been instances where she has called me in but hasn't come in herself as she messed up the calendar and I'm just making my three hour commute back. 

I feel she is not a good manager and I'm not being heard. I'm at the verge of quitting as this is causing me too much stress and I don't like the work. 

I'm just too stressed today as this is the first time I stood up for myself by defying her orders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/167cf9k/hired_as_a_remote_employee_being_called_to_office/,1693587064.0,150,234,WFH

1akmbpr,U.S. workers are getting scooped up by international companies hiring remote roles,"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/us-workers-are-getting-remote-jobs-with-international-companies.html

It's getting harder to find a remote job in the U.S., but you might have better luck working from home for a company based abroad.

The number of American workers hired by international companies grew 62% last year, according to the State of Global Hiring Report from Deel, an HR platform that specializes in global hiring.

The report is based on 300,000 contracts between Deel customers and workers for both contractors and full-time employees, and roughly 85% of those contracts are for remote positions.

American workers are most likely to be hired by companies in the U.K., Canada, France, Singapore and Australia.

The spike in U.S. workers vying for remote jobs headquartered overseas ""feels correlated with the elimination of remote roles"" stateside, says Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz. He knows from experience people are quitting jobs with return-to-office requirements to be remote: ""A couple of our competitors did that, and we hired their best people. So I welcome them to keep doing it.""

Workers with unique, in-demand skills being hired internationally

Global employers want to tap into the U.S. talent market because it's so large and has produced some of the most influential companies in the world, Bouaziz says. International bosses want to ""leverage more U.S. talent to bring some of that culture that leads to the biggest enterprises in the world to their home country.""

Americans who work remotely for international employers tend to live in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Austin and Miami. These U.S. economic powerhouses are ""a playground"" to hire highly knowledgeable workers with ""unique skills"" in product, growth and sales, Bouaziz says. Some of the most common jobs are in research, sales, software engineering, content and product.

""A lot of those companies are thinking, 'How do we build the right playbook that they've done in the U.S.?"" Bouaziz adds. ""One way is to bring U.S. workers to their companies.""

By age, roughly half of American workers with contracts via Deel are between 25 and 34 years old; 18% are between 35 and 44, while 25% are 45 years or older.

The upsides and downsides

Working remotely for an internationally company isn't as straightforward as simply working from home.

Aside from figuring out taxes and other HR compliance issues, Bouaziz says it's important to consider differences in time zones. A Californian working for a company based in Europe may have to adjust to early hours.

A lot also rides on how the company's distributed workforce is set up: Are you the only American employed by a company abroad, or are you part of a larger group stateside? Do you work from home, or will you go into a satellite office? Does your whole team work the same hours, or do you overlap for part of the day and rely on asynchronous work for the other?

Then, cultural differences come into play from the small things (like holiday time off) to the big (communication norms). ""Jumping cultures can be quite intense,"" Bouaziz says. ""It's something you need to be malleable for. It's not hard, but you do need to understand"" and accept norms "" to make everyone comfortable and do their best work while being considerate.""

That being said, accepting the norms of a different country's work culture can also be a big plus. You may enjoy a different style of communication or perspective on work-life balance. Or you might thrive integrating into an organization with more diversity, Bouaziz says, especially if you get to work with colleagues across multiple countries. Those benefits can extend beyond the workplace, he adds: ""Different perspectives help you have a different lens on the world.""

Being able to bring a company to a new U.S. market can be an interesting challenge, he adds, and you may get to be among the first to bring U.S. culture to an international organization.

If you're interested in landing a remote job for a company based abroad, start by using job boards like LinkedIn and filtering for remote jobs based ""worldwide."" Another resource is Otta, which lists jobs at international startups and trending companies that are more likely to have remote flexibility. (For what it's worth, Deel is hiring for 190 open roles around the world, a spokesperson adds.)

Ultimately, ""don't overthink it too much,"" Bouaziz says. ""You'll find that people, wherever you go, tend to be nice.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1akmbpr/us_workers_are_getting_scooped_up_by/,1707257566.0,38,315,WFH

17mzflq,200k remote vs 175k hybrid,"I know it sounds like a no brainer but hear me out.

**Hybrid job:** 175k TC with a large multinational corporation. Company has huge brand recognition and would be good to have on my resume. Requires 2-3 days a week on site, the office is about 35 minutes without traffic and about an hour with traffic one way. Sounds horrible but my last job was fully remote and I honestly missed leaving the house and interacting with people. I was laid off from my last job too so the idea of working for a stable MNC sounds kinda nice. The team at this company also seems very enjoyable to work with and despite the traffic, I expect decent work-life-balance. This job is also in a part of town where I have a lot of friends who I don't get to see as much so this will give me more opportunities to do so after work.

**Remote job:** 200k TC with a fifty person start up. The company itself seems like a shit show based on all my interactions with them during the recruiting process. This job will also require lots of early mornings and late nights because I would be working closely with many offshore teams. Its a slightly more senior position than the hybrid job, but it will likely be way more stressful because its a startup and they seem to lack a lot of business processes.

15v76yf,Where Should I Look for Remote Work?,"I've been working in banking for the past five years under the impression that moving up in my career would potentially grant me the opportunity to work from home. I've always known banking professionals to work from home and have flexibility. I have always wanted this for myself as my work life balance is important to me. So when everyone got sent home to WFH in 2020 I was so excited! I absolutely loved it and felt more like myself than I ever have. I got to work this way for over two years.

Last year my company announced mandatory RTO two days per week and last week they announced they would be increasing the requirement to three days a week. I am now wondering if eventually I will be working in an office five days a week again. One of the reasons cited in the announcement is that other banks are also requiring three days in office so to remain competitive we will be doing the same.

If banking and finance are moving away from WFH, I don't want to go down this career path anymore. I will do anything to get to work from home again, including a career change. I will go back to school, get certifications, whatever, but I want a career the aligns with the work life balance that I want.

1abpjnq,"WSJ fear-mongering: When Layoffs Happen, Remote Workers Are Hardest Hit New data shows fully remote employees are more likely to be let go than their peers. They're also more likely to quit.","https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/layoffs-remote-work-data-980ed59d

https://archive.ph/xfIda

Laying off employees is complicated. New data suggests that managers tend to have an easier time showing remote workers the door.  

Workers logging on from home five days a week were 35% more likely to be laid off in 2023 than their peers who put in office time, according to an analysis of two million white-collar workers conducted by employment data provider Live Data Technologies. The analysis showed 10% of fully remote workers were laid off last year, compared with 7% of those working in an office full time or on a hybrid basis.

""When a hiring manager gets news they have to cut 10% of the staff, it's easier to put someone on the list you don't have a close personal relationship with,"" says Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm. Much of the disparity, he says, is that it's simply harder to build attachments to people you don't see face to face.
Some companies have been more intentional about putting remote workers on the chopping block. Wayfair
, the online home-goods retailer, recently told employees that remote workers would be more likely to be affected in company layoffs. Executives also told staff they believe most workers should be in an office most days.

""We went overboard in hiring during a strong economic period and veered away from our core principles,"" Chief Executive Niraj Shah wrote in an earlier staff memo. Wayfair said while the company believes its best work is done in person, it will continue to have remote roles when warranted.

Out of sight, out of mind

Given that many layoffs over the past year have been concentrated in tech--a remote-friendly industry that overhired during the pandemic--it's not surprising that people working exclusively from home have been harder hit, says George Penn, a managing vice president at Gartner
, an advisory firm, who consults with companies on workforce restructuring. 
Other managerial perceptions could be at play, too, he adds. A Gartner survey in 2021 found that 68% of executives and managers believed in-office workers were higher performers than remote employees. 

In Albuquerque, N.M., Liana Robertson, 56 years old, who was laid off this month from her client support job, says she struggled in her fully remote role to get on the same page as her manager.
""Bosses don't think you're actually doing work, because they can't see what you're doing,"" she says. ""They assume everything takes 10 minutes, and why haven't you finished it?"" 
Ron Porter, a Korn Ferry
consultant on workforce issues, says he is hearing from clients that fully remote workers are getting cut more frequently than their in-office and hybrid colleagues. Part of it, he says, is natural human reluctance managers feel to cut those they have to face in person. It's also possible that workers who are remote 100% of the time may be more marginal to start with, he adds, with managers preferring to keep their strongest employees doing the most important tasks close to them at the office when possible.

Easy come, easy go

Alyssa Ciesky, 40, a talent acquisition specialist based in San Antonio, says that as a fully remote worker, she's aware of the risks. ""They're easy to get rid of, you can't put a face to the name, there's no personal connection."" she says of workers like herself. When Ciesky was laid off at the end of 2022 from her fully remote role at a semiconductor company, she says, her manager was based in England. She said she wasn't surprised.
Still, she says that as a mother of two young children, she's willing to take on the prospect of instability for the flexibility of remote work.
""It's worth it,"" she says, adding that she also likes the feeling of autonomy and the ability to focus that working from home offers. 
David Risch, a recruiter in the supply-chain industry, says that especially in today's weaker job market, he cautions candidates to keep their eyes open with all-remote roles.

""We warn them, easy come, easy go,"" he says. ""A company's going to invest in someone who's investing in them."" 

Remote workers are also more likely to quit. According to Live Data Technologies, 12% of fully remote workers left their company and began a new job within two months in 2023, compared with 9% of those who worked on a hybrid or in-person basis. 

Some CEOs say that while they personally don't look at an employee's remote-work status when determining job cuts, they understood why work-from-home status could put them at higher risk. Other data and studies indicate that executives are rewarding in-office employees with promotions and favorable assignments. 
""If you have a person working in finance who's not coming to the office, why wouldn't you hire that same person in India or in the Philippines?"" said Christian Ulbrich, chief executive of real-estate company Jones Lang LaSalle
, noting that in many cases overseas workers can do the same job for less money. 

""If you don't see anybody, somebody at all, you literally may forget how valuable that person is.""

I can't even get a hybrid job and before the schedules would be 4 days at home one in office but now that's rare to find apparently and they all want 3+ days in office.

My current job is making me extremely depressed but it's fully remote which helps my depression a little. Going to an office always made/makes me anxious, depressed, and exacerbates my fatigue so when remote work became popular it was a huge relief for my mental health, to the point I have been adamant about never going to an office job again unless I have no choice. I've gotten so desperate to the point I've considered applying to an in person one which I feel like I could get and just continue looking for remote jobs but then I'm worried that would hinder my ability to get one because now I look like a job hopper and they'd ask why am I looking to leave somewhere after only being there three months. And/or being forced to stay 1-2 years because I can't find another job. It feels like a lose lose but the longer I stay here the less experience I have in the field I want to be in and I'm honestly convinced they're going to lay us off any day now. 

Has anyone had to do this and successfully left the onsite job after a short period of time? How did you explain it? Being unemployed isn't an option so to me right now the alternative to quitting is taking an office job and keep looking because apparently the market is so bad that even hybrid jobs are competitive. If my current job was in the industry I'm looking to be in I'd probably just stay but it's not.

Update 2/1/23: my boss just moved me on to a new project today that is even worse than what I was doing before. I'm afraid this is the sign I was looking for to suck it up and apply to something else even if it has to be onsite.

tbmpqm,international remote wfh work,"hi everyone,

i started a new job about 6 months ago which has been a 100% wfh position. the company and all the other workers are interstate which makes it difficult to connect with people. 

ive decided to take some annual leave and travel internationally. the plan is to stay overseas and secretly work from home overseas (hopefully they wont find out).

im guessing this wont matter as i work remotely anyways.

has anyone been able to work from home in another country with success?

14nbc9n,How can I find a remote job opportunity?,"I am in a bit of a bind. I just graduated recently and am having a lot of difficulty finding a remote job. I graduated with a BS in June and the only relevant work experience I have is working at a Best Buy but the pay is terrible and doesn't sustain my lifestyle. I really want to travel to Japan and Europe and work from there. For my resume, I tried looking for internships while in school but didn't find anything relevant that was actually a remote job opportunity. I had one offer obtained in December but the division didn't have any work for remotes so I declined thinking I could get one elsewhere. Believe me I tried so hard to negotiate as much as I could to work remotes but I was told by the recruiter no and they set a deadline for me to accept.  

I have been using LinkedIn and Indeed and been using this religiously. I got my resume looked over and trying to write cover letters. I applied to like 100 places that have any keyword that says 'remotes' but haven't gotten a single response. I am getting desperate. I really want a remote opportunity because ever since I was a kid I dreamed of having my own office just like my dad because he had remotes for everything. I loved everything about it and especially the way they work shooting out lasers wirelessly. My favorite remote was always the remote we had for our stereo system because it had these funky buttons and I would pretend it was a cellphone. I am so passionate about remotes since then and I want to get into designing and fixing them. I also love the remote for my 43"" TV because I love putting on Netflix through the little red shortcut button on it. Also love my garage door opener remote. Feels like I am in charge of the opportunity to open and close a huge door to my future. But no place out there is giving me an opportunity to work on any type of remote. Is it because its outdated tech since everything is switched to app-based now?

17ulkt3,Misleading Remote position Vs. In Office Role?,"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this in.

A few months ago I started a remote accounting position with a local bank. Coworkers are nice and helpful, pay is okay, and my supervisor is a bit cold but not really a micromanager. (so far...)

The problem is I feel really misled. I went for this position because it was sold as a basic accounting support role. As an introverted person that's the whole reason I even picked this field. In the actual job I quickly found out that I'm actually on the phone a lot. Lots of A/R and collections type of work. I can do it but I really don't like it and feel pretty annoyed that this was never brought up. Not to mention it just causes unnecessary stress in my day. I understand that this is a part of the accounting field but to have it be a MAJORITY of my daily work is different...

I have an interview from a local CPA firm for a similar role but it is in person. During that interview I would make sure to inquire if I'd be doing a majority of collections type of work. That position would be a 10 minute commute and pays slightly less.

I don't know if I should stick it out with the comforts of a remote job but spending 80% of the day doing something I really hate versus having to be in office but not having to spend the day doing something I hate.

Any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/17ulkt3/misleading_remote_position_vs_in_office_role/,1699911196.0,2,7,WFH

ohmnb6,Work offering hybrid but job is 100% online and remote even before the pandemic so I want to stay home permanently,"I work in IT/research and my job has been remote with people across the country from the beginning.  We would basically go into an office to work and have remote meetings.  Even our small staff meetings were conducted via Zoom with all of us in our offices!  We officially got sent home 100% of the time in March of 2020 and now our supervisor wants us to come in twice a week and work from home 3 days a week.  Sounds like a good deal except when you realize that there's no reason at all to endure that hellish commute, pay for parking (we do not get stipends) and sit in that stale environment in a high crime neighborhood to do my job.  I've been so happy and content with my job this past year and I've really started to enjoy my work.  My productivity has been through the roof, I'm fine with taking meetings at whatever time of day and I'm here all of the time for my disabled husband who also suffers from depression (which has been markedly improved over the past year or so).  I also got the best review of my life for last year's work.  

I've been with this place on various projects for almost 20 years.  So leaving isn't something I want to take lightly.  I do like and respect my co-workers, even though I am a total introvert.  But I'm in the twilight of my career (the last 10 - 15 years or so of it) and life is too short.  If I were younger, I'd count my blessings but I'm old and I'm tired of just putting up with this.   My husband is older than me and I want to spend more time with him. I don't mind coming in on occasion when there is a physical need for me to be in the office or even for our quarterly, all day planning sessions. But I don't want to have to come in every week for no reason just to make someone else feel more in charge, even for just two days.  I meet with HR next week to discuss this further because I won't just blanket agree to hybrid, which I believe is probably a slippery slope back to 5 days a week because everyone in charge is an extrovert that loves that office life.  Any advice on how to present my case is appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/ohmnb6/work_offering_hybrid_but_job_is_100_online_and/,1625937123.0,15,30,WFH
vc1fdc,Remote work is not for everyone,"I get pissed off when I read articles about people being forced to go back to the office. Working for a remote-first company for 4 years now I can't imagine ever working in a crowded and loud open-space office again. But the reality is that most companies aren't mature enough for remote work. They switched to it because they were forced to do so, did a poor job executing it and now they want to go back. 

My recommendation to people who want to continue working remotely: find a job at a remote-first company that does remote work well. 

I wrote a blog post on the topic and came up with 5 basic requirements to make remote work work. They're also a good checklist to separate the better remote companies from the rest when looking for a good remote job.

19cjjql,I accepted a pretty dreamy position that is fully remote with very little travel - I'm over the moon (and welcoming any advice).,"I've been at my current job for 8 years and I accepted a position last week for a fully remote position.  I really like the people in my department, but it has been becoming a meatgrinder and the powers that be fail to see reason, so this all kinda came at the perfect time for me.  I'll be making 25% more money, and it encompasses maybe 10% of the work I'm currently doing in an on-site position (in addition to some pretty solid extras).  We did do remote for a year and a half at my current job, but the powers that be wanted RTO more than anything, even though some of them didn't even know how long we worked remote.

That is what it is though.  I'm currently able to work from home when the need arises (sick, but not in bed all day sick/need to make a doctors appointment/worker coming to the house for repairs/etc) so I'm used to being able to work remote, but I guess I don't know what it's gonna be like to have a fully remote position.

During the pandemic I literally did my job from a Microsoft Surface while sitting on my couch.  After the RTO I ended up moving a desk to a room in my house and we set up my personal machines and work provided some equipment which has made a big difference working remote for me.

My new position is providing the basic setup - laptop, dock, keyboard, mouse, two monitors.

I purchased an electric standing desk, a filing cabinet with storage, and a walking pad.

I think four times or so a year I will have to fly out and go on site, but from my understanding it's generally for interaction and community within the company as well as some various instances where on-site work will need to be completed.

I'm beside myself excited and very pleased with the position.  Every benefit is better and I've wanted to work from home since before 2020.

Is there any general advice or tips anyone feels would be helpful to this transition for me?  My wife works in an office close to home, we are childfree, and have a few cats and a dog.  I get plenty of interaction from friends.  I just want to do well and hit the ground running and I want to avoid bad habits since a lot of movement is now removed from my day (though it just seems like it'll be easier to exercise during the day now).

14x5sne,Remote Work Tax Question,"I feel like this has been asked a few different ways, but I can't find the exact scenario I am facing and/or solid advice on how to proceed. 

I have a second/third interview coming up with a large organization in Illinois. I live in Mississippi. The job is advertised as remote, so remote work is not the problem. The problem is this nugget I got from their HR: Company X *not registered to do business in Mississippi. This means that the  Company X paycheck would deduct federal taxes, but not any state/local  taxes;* ***the employee would be responsible for submitting any state/local  taxes to the appropriate  authorities.*** 

So....this is giving me pause. Everything I have read says that companies MUST register with a state and withhold state income tax for employees that reside there. I would be fine if they said they were going to double tax me and I had to file the out-of-state Illinois return to get a refund, but this seems odd to me. You all will probably be SHOCKED to know that the MS Dept of Revenue is less than useful and told me to consult an attorney. I will ask my CPA before accepting any job offer, but was curious if you all had any insight. Would it be as simple as estimating my state income tax throughout the year and just paying come tax time? I am fine with that too, but certainly don't want to fun afoul of any tax laws and/or get in a situation where the employer wants to let me go vs. the headache of registering to do business in another state. I have no idea how arduous that process is and my job is literally one of thousands at the company and not THAT important (no matter what i tell myself!).

ykfuga,"Traveling while ""working remote"" help!","Hi all, I work for a company that has been remote since the pandemic. Our company encourages us to use our global offices, but is not permitted.
I had scheduled a trip home to see my family weeks ago. I didn't let my boss know since it's same time zone and wouldn't effect my work schedule/hours.

I've received a calendar invite for a work dinner with my colleagues on the date that I'm traveling home. How should I go about this? Flights are too expensive to reschedule now. Is it unprofessional if I request to move the dinner earlier in the week? What's the right work etiquette to navigate this situation. Any help from managers on this subreddit are appreciated.

17nznjw,Stress of even the possibility of RTO is making me lose my mind. How do I lobby to stay remote? Is there any hope?,"
I've been at my company for about 2.5 years and with my current team for about 18 months. I love my job, my boss, and my team. I work as a data analyst, mostly doing data visualization. Lately my boss has been bringing me into more ad hoc analyst asks, which I have enjoyed. I'm also wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science in Spring '24. My career change from biz management to data analytics/CS is all but complete. I get roped into some CS work - like right now I'm doing some NLP in python to get sentiment analysis, common words/phrases used in customer feedback, etc 

Anyways, I moved down to Florida for my first job with this company in the midst of the lockdown in 2020. I've been in office maybe 10-12 times. This job I actually applied for was listed as fully remote, but HR changed me to local because I was here. Didn't love that. I think it's fair to say my team works best remote. My direct boss strongly aligns with how I feel, as does our Sr Engineer. We also have two junior analysts - one of which is remote because he was hired and lives in the Midwest. So there's precedent on our team.

We've gotten a new CEO. He spoke highly of hybrid work and hinted at imposing a 3 day a week mandate next year. For now, he's ""encouraging"" us to come in. He's pro hybrid, but not pro fully remote. I have been remote the last five years of my professional career. It's what works for me. I never want to sit in an office. I will come in bi weekly, quarterly, as needed. But I am building dashboards and doing ad hoc analytics. There's no need to sit next to my team. We communicate fine via Slack. When I work in office - I lost 2 hours of sleep, don't have time or energy for grad school at night, am just generally miserable. So far its been a non-issue, but our CEO has heightened my anxiety. My only leverage is I basically own our entire BI platform. It would be hard to replace me on a whim.

We're currently in our ""peak"" season. Everyone's swamped and stressed - especially my boss. But I'm losing sleep over this. And to make matters more complicated, I want to move out of Florida when my lease is up next May. I'd like to move to the Midwest in a state we also operate in. I am miserable and lonely here. I miss being near any family. I just can't stand it here. And there's no reason to stay.

Im just looking for advice when to talk to my boss and how to professionally discuss this request. My anxiety has me prepared for the worst. We speak weekly in one on ones but it's usually all time for actual work. I try not to rock the boat or be difficult, but being remote is the most important thing to me. Part of me thinks it's best to wait for peak to end, the other part of me thinks I shouldn't have to live with the anxiety. I'm glad she seems aligned with me on preferring remote, and I originally planned to speak with her in august when we do our yearly bonus/career conversation, but that was moved company wide to January. I'm just tired of constantly hearing about the office, office surveys, etc. I think our CEO was speaking generally vs specifically to me and my team but I hate the lack of certainty. I just cannot do the office and all the social and financial drain that comes with it - especially since I am so high performing. Before I was hired, we had this project contracted to a consulting firm where 3 people did my job. We've completely streamlined it since.

zyoves,Remote WFH Employee; Employer Instituting Mandatory Call Requirements - Seeking Advice,"Just looking for advice.. I work in an administrative type role and I am a salaried employee. I did not sign any kind of contract regarding hours at the time of employment. 

I have had set Monday - Friday hours since I began, no weekends or holidays. I found out today, that a new client has enrolled in our service and was promised / sold 24/7 access to speak to someone in my department.

We do not have staffing for this, and they anticipate volume to be lower, so instead of hiring overnight employees they are utilizing a call model. 

Today we received our new schedule and we are expected to take an entire week, 62 hours to be exact, of call on top of our regularly scheduled 40 hour week.. with the expectation that you will take one week per month. The call hours include weekends and holidays. 

I voiced my concerns to my supervisor, however unfortunately this is pretty out of their hands. They were sympathetic to the opposition I had to so much call, but stated their hands were completely tied. 

I overall enjoy my job, and of course am beyond grateful for the opportunity to work from home... but after today I'm honestly left a little shook that such a large scheduling change was just thrown at us. 

I have severe PTSD and require a sleep aid to sleep at night. I am mainly concerned I won't wake for the call in a manner that allows me to do my job, and therefore will have to go 7 full days without good sleep / nightmares. I voiced this to my supervisor as well. 

I am mainly looking for any advice or suggestion that would help me navigate this bizarre situation.. I am just at a loss.

By contrast, a third of full-time office workers reported a similar sense of connection, nearly the same as last year. Hybrid workers clocked in highest, with 35% saying their companies' mission made them feel their jobs were important.""

I inquired and they lead me to the interview where I was told that I had gotten the job at the end and would need to submit my ID. I asked to verify herself and she sent me a picture that to an unknowing eye had some clever edits in it but wasn't %100 clear of artifacts (digital evidence of editing) when I asked this person who posted to also verify herself I was told that if I was uncomfortable I don't have to continue ""a lot of people are looking for this job.""

I have to say this was heartbreaking, I'm one year into recovering from spine surgery my spouse left me and i'm running out of workers comp. I'm in desperate need of a job and vocation change as my back can't take labor anymore and I need to support myself. all I have is a clean identity and was sooo desperate to be given a chance I didn't see the red flags until she said ""Welcome to the team"" and then started to ask for personal information. it was at that point she wouldn't verify with me beyond this questionable picture. theres a part of me that wishes someone here would tell me its real, im that desperate. but if it isnt and it looks like its not. the hope given/ripped away from me is criminal. Reading all these posts calling them it all left me in tears. There may be soooo many people who like me need something like this to live to survive and if this is a scam god knows how many people are affected or destroyed by it beyond where they are at that moment. I'm desperate I need change I need to control my life and that starts with finding remote work and this experience crushed me, my spirit and has left me feeling hopeless.  If anyone can tell me otherwise I pray you can but confirming this isn't real either would be helpful.

If anyone here can maybe send suggestions for where to apply for remote work that would be greatly appreciated as I am in great need to get to work asap.

During COVID, we worked fully remote for a year or so, then they instituted a hybrid policy. The company is not entirely opposed to remote work, but it's certainly an exception. My family and I have decided to move to another state however, and I informed my management of this recently. We technically have an office in the state I'm going to, but I'll be nowhere near it. This is good news because it means I can remain an employee and continue to have benefits, vacation, etc. rather than convert to a contractor like the one person who's done this before me. 

My boss and our VP are positive about the move, citing nothing will change from a raise or promotion schedule, they won't dock pay only adjust up for COL, they'll work something out with the company to pay for my return once a quarter, and to ultimately not worry: I have a job. What my role really looks like, and the career trajectory is at this point is an unknown, because again, they were targeting me for VP and running the department. Those promises sound great and all, but I'll be the first to do this and remain an employee at my level, setting a big precedent, and it still has to be approved by the president, and maybe the board.

15unlrp,Canada's CBC National News is looking for remote workers to share their stories.,"Hello,

My name is Laetitia Dogbe, I am a National News producer at the **CBC in Toronto** and I'm working on a story for Tuesday, Sept. 5th to coincide with a new **Return-To-Office Mandates** that some Canadian companies are rolling out. 

**As always we want to look beyond the report and put faces to the events.**

Maybe some of you here would be interested in talking to me and sharing your stories.

Ideally, we are looking for **people working in Canada** who were asked to **go to the office full time and refused**, people **who may be quitting** and **looking for a new job** because they can't work from the office or would just prefer not to. That could also be people who made the move a few months ago to recently. Please feel free to message me!

We would love to hear your stories -from anywhere in Canada- about what it means for you to go back to working in person.

You can reach out to me here on reddit or email me laetitia.dogbe ( at) cbc .ca

Accompanying it is a file that you have to edit/correct based on the information in the document. For instance, maybe the file is missing the name of the person it's about. So you sift through the documents included to find that person's name, you type it out in the ""Name"" field or whatever, and then you release record. You do this over and over again a few hundred times, and then you clock out for the day.

15ywjt6,Stuck at a Pivotal Moment: 5-Year Osteopathy Commitment vs. Global Remote Work Dream. What Would You Do?," 

I'm about 27 years old, originally from Italy, and currently living in France.I am living in France because my profession is paid nuts in my homecountry.

At the moment, I'm a physiotherapist, and I'm about to start a 5-year osteopathy school, which costs 30,000 euros and will occupy 4-5 days of every month. I decided on this path because I signed a contract that will grant me about 30,000 euros (essentially covering the osteopathy course cost) if I stay working as a physiotherapist here for 5 years.

My net worth right now is around 20,000 euros.

I'd appreciate some guidance as I'm quite confused about my next steps.

My ultimate goal is financial freedom with passive or semi-passive income streams.I know it's challenging, but it's what I aspire to.From my research and learning, I concluded that building an online business might be the answer. However, I currently lack any IT skills.Moreover, I believe that establishing an online business is intricate and might demand a lot of time. Reflecting on my major goal of financial freedom, I realized that dealing with many people physically every day is draining me physically, psychologically, and emotionally. Additionally, I feel trapped in this city and country when I'd love to experience life in different parts of the world, something my current job doesn't allow.

I considered an intermediate step to study and acquire a skill that would allow me to have a 100% remote job that I can perform anywhere.

My questions are:

1. In your opinion, is it easier to find a 100% remote job starting from a position where I have no qualifications, or is it simpler to establish an online business?
2. Is it feasible to find a well-paid or even moderately paid remote job without any qualifications but by committing to serious study for some time? If yes:

. Which skill should I focus on? Perhaps web developer?

. Where should I study?

. Realistically, how long might it take?

3) I should start osteopathy in September. However, as I've mentioned, I dream of financial freedom and a remote job that allows me to travel and live in different parts of the world. Is it truly worth undertaking this course? The only potential advantage I see is leveraging this additional qualification to create an online business later. Moreover, if I want that 30,000 euro bonus, I must stay in France for five years; otherwise, I'd be obliged to repay the initial money given to me.

Thank you so much for your answers",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/15ywjt6/stuck_at_a_pivotal_moment_5year_osteopathy/,1692775753.0,1,1,WFH
127zo61,Found out remote was not an option well into interview process,"I was contacted by a recruiter a couple weeks ago about a job that would be a good next step for me and come with a nice raise. The description mentioned remote or in-person, so I clarified with the recruiter that I live 3 hours away and would not be able to be in-person regularly, although I would be willing to travel on occasion. He confirmed with the employer that fully remote would be acceptable, as most of the team is only in once a week. We scheduled a call and talked for 20-30 mins, after which he agreed to move me forward in the process.

He set up an interview with the hiring manager, which went well. We discussed my location and the fact that I would need to be fully remote, with occasional travel as a possibility. I was told again that they are open to having someone fully remote in this role.

Yesterday, I got an invitation to an interview with the CIO for this afternoon, which I spent the last 24 hours preparing for. I join the zoom call and he asks where I'm calling in from and we chat a bit about my location and why I chose to move here. He then asks if I'm aware that this is a one day a week in person position and I have to explain that no, I spoke in detail about my situation with multiple people and was told that fully remote was an option. He tells me they have this policy and can't make exceptions. We agree to end the call, because I'm not going to commute 3 hours each way (honestly more like 4 with rush hour traffic).

I used to live in the UK and I'm planning on moving back.

I would like to take my job with me as it's a remote job and it will be one less thing to do when I move back. Plus I would like to apply for a Spanish digital nomad visa in the future, so continuing this job and having a track record of working remotely will be really helpful.

The problem is the time difference. NZ and UK are almost exactly opposite - their day is our night and our day is their night, there's very little overlap where I can speak to my colleagues on Teams/zoom etc. Despite this, I am willing to try and make it work. I mean, we do have the weekly team meeting on Teams but other than that I mostly communicate with my colleagues through emails and chats (not phone calls). I am willing to finish everything a day or two earlier (so deadlines are met NZ time and also to leave a little time for questions and reviews) and stay late or wake up super early to make/answer calls if it's absolutely necessary. I can even go part time so that I am able to finish everything on time NZ time and perhaps leave behind work that requires constant communication.

I'm a recent grad trying to break into IT, but the only job in the field I've been able to land is project-based and I'm only working about one day every two weeks. I am supposed to have the car I drive handed over to me, which requires me to pay for insurance. I'd rather not have to quit the only job I'm getting usable experience from, and I would rather not juggle a second in-person job with a commute until I can make sure the car is as fixed up and reliable as possible.

Does anyone have any ideas (IT-related or not) for part-time remote work I could do while I get a few more months of experience in IT? I've tried applying for data entry and CSR positions, but many of the data entry positions seem sketchy, and I tried a few simulations while applying for CSR positions and many of those, especially the phone-based ones, really overwhelmed me with their KPIs and other metrics. So if I am going to be a CSR I'd prefer if it was chat/email-based. I am also not super comfortable with sales and recruiting, particularly cold-calling.

vd77cq,Remote Jobs for Socially Anxious Introverts?,"Hi all; was hoping someone out there had some advice for me. 

I graduated with my masters in human resource management last December after getting my bachelors degree in multidisciplinary studies (AKA three minors in communication, business administration, and economics). I never felt particularly drawn to a certain field of study or career path, so I figured HR would be good as I am a very empathetic person who gets enjoyment from helping people.

About three months ago, I started my job as an HR associate for a college in the city I moved to after graduating. What I'm quickly realizing is that my social anxiety (paired with my general anxiety and depression) can get the better of me when I have to communicate with a large amount of people. I also don't enjoy much of my work, which consists of vague instructions and parameters from my sometimes rude teammates. I enjoy the days I get to work remote (away from the random pop ins at work and random characters on my commute). Essentially, I'm not very happy.

I'm hoping somebody out there knows of any job opportunities that would be fully remote, low stress, and that I will be qualified for. I've always enjoyed proofreading and helping clean up friend's papers and resumes, spending hours getting lost down a rabbit hole on the Internet reading about obscure topics or finding niche and specific information, organizing and tidying things up, and simple/basic math. I don't have any coding experience, so that field is pretty much scratched out. Direct and straight job tasks would be ideal. Additionally, I would probably need to make above the mid $50k's to support my household. 

So in conclusion, I'm looking to move away from my current HR job to a fully remote opportunity that's low stress and introvert friendly. Any suggestions would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/vd77cq/remote_jobs_for_socially_anxious_introverts/,1655334018.0,2,1,WFH

o4milo,I'm starting to think there are a lot of remote jobs hiding in plain sight.,"Has anyone noticed employers listing the same position in multiple cities (where they don't seem to have an office) rather than listing them as remote? I'm thinking specifically of postings on LinkedIn which has ""remote"" as a location option, but I'm sure there are others.

I suppose they could be trying to only get applications from states they already have employees in to save a paperwork and keep payroll costs down, but they are also ruling out a whole mess of people  those states who aren't near the dozen cities they advertise in. 

I guess the take away is: if like me, you have a fairly specialized skill set and want to work remote from a more rural location, you might want to look at job listings in the nearest city or two of size and investigate the ones you like. If you see they don't seem have an office in the city its probably remote, especially if you also see it posted in other cities without offices.

I was also just approached on LinkedIn about two different positions that were not advertised as remote, in cities that are 4+ hours from the city listed in my profile. I wish I'd asked why they weren't advertised as remote, but in both cases the employers said they would be fine with me working from home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/o4milo/im_starting_to_think_there_are_a_lot_of_remote/,1624247867.0,7,12,WFH
13gfejl,"I love my new remote role, but can't find a satisfying rhythm. What do you suggest?","I'm 6 months into a fully remote leadership role in a large NGO (think: World Vision/Oxfam). I love the small team I supervise (4 of us in different time zones), salary is 90k, and organizational culture is great. I've gathered with my 15 person department in person a couple times in Chicago and DC and they are all the real deal. I feel so fortunate. 

Don't get me wrong - I love the flexibility of remote work. My previous job was a hybrid situation with tons of flexibility. I would not ever go back to an in office 9-5 unless there were dire circumstances. I'm 40 with a couple kids in a MCOL city and love the flexibility + access to jobs like mine that I couldn't get before without moving. 

All this good stated, I'm having a hard time with the remote experience. I am energized by (the right kind of) people and meaningful communication. I do like the quiet of my house a couple days of week, but every day being alone and grinding it out/all the Zoom meetings are not life-giving to me. I have a co-working space membership and a few favorite coffee shops, but they just feel like places I get distracted...the relationships I can make there don't lead to the trust-building needed to get complex work done as they aren't my colleagues. 

I miss having my top 3 colleagues from my previous job in the vicinity where we huddle up, whiteboard it out, crack open a few beers after.  WFH can't offer a direct equivalent for this, but I wonder what you'd recommend I try after getting a sense of my situation/personality.  I need life giving work rhythms. 

For example, one thing I do is block an hour for errands or running in the middle of the day so that I get out of the house intentionally. Another thing I'm trying is to plan coffee or happy hour meetings with friends throughout the days for intentional connection (though not work related). 

That said, I am still not fully content with the rhythm of my days. What suggestions do you have?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/13gfejl/i_love_my_new_remote_role_but_cant_find_a/,1683978408.0,16,16,WFH
wzh0yc,Remote career help/advice with no experience,"So a quick background:
I'm 22F with a part time job at a daycare at the local school. It was my first official job and I have been employed there since 2019 in various positions. Most, if not all, of my experience is in child care since I have regularly cared for my 6yo nephew since he was born. I have never been interested in college and I have no plans of ever enrolling. 

The thing is, I don't like children. I do not see myself being able to work in my current position for much longer. I do not see myself furthering my career in that field. My goal right now is to find a different job in a work-from-home/remote position. Ultimately I want to have a fully remote career (with decent pay obv) so eventually I can start traveling. 

I have been looking into finding some kind of position in tech since I've heard that's where most wfh jobs come from, but I've become very overwhelmed by the amount of options. I'm not even sure if I even know all the options. I'm not even sure if tech is the right option/career field. However, I have started (veryyyyy slowly) trying to teach myself how to code through Codecademy. 

Is it possible to find something without any experience/degrees?  
Any recommendations/tips would be very appreciated. Any advice or steps to follow would also be extremely helpful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/wzh0yc/remote_career_helpadvice_with_no_experience/,1661644023.0,16,5,WFH
162uzxx,"27-Year-Old Physiotherapist Aspiring to Become a Digital Nomad: Looking for Advice on 100% Remote, Stress-Free Jobs with No Degree Requirement","Good morning,

I'm 27 years old and currently work as a physiotherapist, living in Paris although I'm Italian.I would like some practical advice. I plan to stay in France for another five years to study osteopathy and save up money to buy a house in Italy. However, my goal is to have a 100% remote job that allows me to live anywhere in the world, working solely from a PC.I aspire to a digital nomad lifestyle, and in these 5 years while I'll be in France, I'm willing to use my free time to acquire the necessary skills for such a job, which I know it will almost surely be in an unrelated field to mine.

The job should be:

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.

. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated

. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study

. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

. As stress-free as possible

Which path should I pursue?

zrxl5o,New to Reddit and Looking for Tips on Improving My Remote Workspace,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to Reddit and I'm excited to join this community and learn from all of you. I'm currently working from home due to the pandemic, and I'm looking for ways to improve my remote workspace.

I've noticed that my productivity has been a bit inconsistent lately, and I think it might be because my home office isn't as comfortable or functional as it could be. I'm hoping to make some changes to help me focus better and be more productive.

Here are a few ideas that I'm considering:

1. Upgrading my chair: I've been using an old office chair that isn't particularly comfortable or supportive. I'm thinking about investing in a new ergonomic chair to help me stay comfortable and reduce back pain.
2. Adding more natural light: I don't have a lot of windows in my home office, so it can feel a bit dark and gloomy in there. I'm thinking about getting a desk lamp that simulates natural light to help me stay alert and focused.
3. Organizing my workspace: My desk is currently a bit cluttered and disorganized, which can be distracting. I'm planning on decluttering and reorganizing to create a cleaner, more efficient workspace.

Do you have any other suggestions for improving a remote workspace? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thanks in advance for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/zrxl5o/new_to_reddit_and_looking_for_tips_on_improving/,1671649350.0,4,3,WFH
ps7k8r,Why You Need A Remote Work Policy [Advice],"In a PwC survey of 120 US executives, 83% said: ""the shift to remote work has been successful for their company."" On the other hand, only 5% of those executives believe they can maintain company culture with a fully remote workforce.

But how can remote work be successful if it impedes maintaining company culture?

Answer: It's a trick question. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

You can take the benefits of remote work--flexibility, efficiency, etc.--and still retain the benefits of in-person work. In short, there is a middle way. 

But to walk that middle way, you need a roadmap. You need a remote work policy.

So in this post, we'll start with the basics: what a remote work policy is and why you need one. Then we'll get into the steps required to create and implement a remote work policy.

To wrap things up, we'll share a remote work policy template that you can adapt for your own organization. 

## What is a Remote Work Policy?

A remote work policy spells out your company's rules for remote working. This could include, but isn't limited to, rules governing:

1. Who is eligible for remote work
2. How much remote work will be allowed
3. Professional expectations for remote workers
4. Home work station equipment requirements and allowances
5. Network security
6. Time tracking (for hourly workers)

In short, a [remote work policy](https://www.hugo.team/blog/remote-work-policy) spells out guidelines for employees who work from any location other than a company office. The policy's goal is to maximize the benefits of remote work for the company and employees.

## Why You Need a Remote Work Policy

There are both strategic and logistical reasons you need a remote work policy. In the next two subsections, we'll cover both these categories.

### Remote Work as a Competitive Advantage

Remote work policies fall under the purview of human resources. But the strategic impact of these policies is company-wide.

In fact, for some organizations, such as InVision, GitLab, Synchrony, or Atlassian, successfully enabling remote work is a key competitive advantage. Yet InVision and GitLab are fully remote, while Synchrony and Atlassian are testing a hybrid model.

In short, these companies press the advantages of remote work in different ways. 

The key for your organization is to understand where and how you can (and can't) press the advantages of remote work.

Among other things, a few advantages and benefits remote work provides include:

1. Reduced real estate costs (i.e. office rent)
2. Expanded access to a larger pool of talented workers
3. Eliminated or greatly reduced commute times
4. Improved ability to attract and retain talent
5. Enhanced employee productivity, well-being, and freedom

Once you've done the legwork to determine how remote work best fits at your company, you need the policy to codify your findings.

### Planning Your Transition to Hybrid or Remote Work

There was no planning for the transition to remote work caused by Covid-19. But sometime in the future, the virus will stop dictating terms. So there's time to plan.   


And according to Nicki Bellington, Atlassian's head of talent programs, ""\[Remote work\] is not like a light switch. We want to crawl and walk and then see how far we run.""  


Both the process of creating your policy, and the document itself, will help you and your employees start to crawl, walk, and then run with remote work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/ps7k8r/why_you_need_a_remote_work_policy_advice/,1632184336.0,0,1,WFH

wgqgd5,Just Got Full Time Remote Job as an Order Support Specialist. What to expect?,"I was hired through a recruitment agency for a job as an Order Support Specialist for a pretty large company. I was told because of my pretty decent typing test scores, that I would be ideal for mostly data entry and as an overflow for the phone support focused employees. I have a few questions for anyone in a similar situation.

Context: I've worked 8 jobs at this point in my life ranging from taking insurance claims in a call center, to working as a customer representative, to driving a forklift in a warehouse. I've never worked a remote job, though most of my background and education is based in Computer Science. So therefore I really have no idea what to expect. My last job was a warehouse so I was lifting up to 50 pounds or more regularly throughout a 10+ hour shift. I'm used to really pushing myself physically to maintain a high level of work performance. I'm worried about going stir crazy sitting without chain-vaping or constantly snacking and drinking lol.

1. Any experience with remote training where you have to be on camera for 8 hours? Not sure at all about etiquette as far as eating and drinking. And I know this a dumb question but I have to ask. Is a discrete drag from a vape, very occasionally without distracting others, acceptable? Common sense says no but....
2. Anyone with a similar job, am I likely to have time once I start the actual job, to get up and go check in with my fiance and 3 year old daughter? I guess I'm asking if it's at all common to have some downtime throughout the day when you're doing a job that's mostly just responding to emails. Even if it's just a few minutes here and there. It's a little hard to imagine completely ignoring them from the next room over for 8 straight hours not including my break. Seems like some of the appeal in having a remote job. I'd probably be a little disappointed if I was glued to the chair the entire shift every day.
3. Any random insight that you think might be helpful? Anything will be helpful at this point.

It has a base salary of PS18,500 with KPI ontop so is not entirely commission dependent and the entirety of the role still hasn't been made apparent to me. The role is just 'Customer Service RDT'.

Basically, it's a simple job board, but it's probably the most complete and well-updated one out there (at least I haven't found others like it). What makes it special is that it's remote-exclusive frontend and backend jobs aggregator, sourcing data from more than 22 different places (most popular job boards) in a single place.  
Everything is checked and all data-discrepancies are filled manually by me (for now). So if you are only looking for remote frontend jobs with salaries, this is the place to go because I am trying to extract that information from each offer and classify it so it's easily visible in the job description :)  
I've already sold a couple of featured ads too!

The [FlexJobs career coaching team](https://www.flexjobs.com/career-coaching-resume-review) offers these tips to remote job seekers who do not hold a bachelor's degree:

For Jobs that Say They Require a Degree

Job descriptions often state that they require an advanced degree, which is frustrating for job seekers who know they could do the job even though they lack this credential. Here's what to do:

* If the job description requires a general ""bachelor's degree"" or ""college degree,"" you can apply even if you don't have one. As long as you're confident you could do the job based on your experience and skills, go ahead and apply.
* On your resume, in the Education section, add a line such as, ""10+ years of experience in lieu of a bachelor's degree"" or ""2 years of coursework completed towards Bachelor of Science in Accounting"" so the keywords ""bachelor's degree"" appear on your document.
* In your cover letter, do a thorough job explaining how you meet many of the other requirements.

For Jobs Where You Don't Match All the Requirements

If you match 60-70% of the qualifications, consider applying. A job description is a wishlist from an employer and they'll almost certainly not wind up hiring someone with most or all of the qualifications. Studies find that many job seekers, especially women, hold themselves back from applying if they don't match the vast majority of the job requirements.

These skills and experience can be helpful to securing a job without a college degree.

* A high school diploma
* Some college experience
* Equivalent work experience
* Fluency in a second language
* Special skills, such as Microsoft Office proficiency
* Volunteer work
* Demonstrated growth mindset and taking initiative to educate and train yourself

rgbwvr,Has Remote Communication been difficult for you and your company?,"If you work remotely, asynchronous communication is a necessity. That's why it's important to understand the difference between asynchronous and synchronous communication, as well as when it's appropriate to use one or the other.

Asynchronous communication allows for asynchronous dialogue to take place - meaning that people can respond whenever they have time, rather than at a specific time like with synchronous communication.

## Definitions: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Communication

**Synchronous communication** is when two or more people communicate at the same time, like in a chat room where everyone is typing messages simultaneously.

**Asynchronous communication** is when each person communicates one after another. Yes, this can be slower than synchronous because there are gaps between responses. But, it can also be more thoughtful and structured, and it works even if you aren't in the same place, time zone, or continent.

## 7 Tips For Better Remote Communication

Rather than debate the merits of async vs. sync, it's easier to understand when to use either mode of communication through these tips and best practices of how and when to use either.

### 1-Set expectations for asynchronous communication.

When you're working on a project with a remote team, assume asynchronous communication is the best method. Then explain to your team that people should generally be checking in at their convenience and not necessarily exactly when they receive an email or message from another person. That way, people won't be constantly monitoring their inbox, and can instead focus on their work.

### 2-Always send follow-up messages if you don't hear back from the other person.

If you don't hear back from someone, send another message to check-in. If it's still not clear that there was an issue with the communication channel or if your colleague didn't get your original email or Slack message, try doing an audio call as a Slack huddle or even using a regular voice call and ask for clarity.

>**Remember**: Asynchronous communication can get missed, so be sure to follow up with your team and ask for clarification.

### 3-Meet in person if you're working on a project together or are able to do so.

Even if you're a fully remote team, from time to time it's great to get together in person. Being together in a space will help you develop deeper bonds with your colleagues, which will ultimately help you with onboarding new hires.

When you are working together in person or can get together for a meetup, asynchronous communication is not as necessary because the context of the conversation is much more clear since there's no possibility of miscommunication through asynchronous means like email.

Meetups also allow remote workers the opportunity to get out of their homes or workspaces and interact with other people in real life.

### 4-Use asynchronous communication for work conversations that need structure, and synchronous communication when emotions are involved.

One of the most important things to remember is that asynchronous communication isn't appropriate for every type of conversation. If you need a quick answer, or if feelings are involved, it's best to have synchronous conversations so people can respond as soon as they're able.

When working with your team on projects and tasks, asynchronous communication usually works best.

Synchronous communication is best when dealing with urgent issues, such as emergencies and disasters.

### 5-Remember asynchronous vs synchronous isn't always black and white.

Some conversations are more suited to asynchronous or synchronous methods of discussion depending on the circumstances. Sometimes a hybrid approach is necessary.

A meeting is a good example. Before a meeting, collaborate asynchronously on the meeting agenda, sharing discussion topics and any materials to review beforehand. This makes the synchronous time--the meeting itself--far more efficient and valuable. After the meeting, again, you can follow through on action items asynchronously.

**Go Further **Use a meeting management tool like Hugo to manage all the async aspects of your meetings (agendas, notes, tasks, etc...)

### 6-Be aware of the impact asynchronous communication can have on your team and how it makes you feel.

It's important to know that asynchronous communication is slower than synchronous, which means people will take longer to get back to you when using asynchronous methods. This also takes a toll emotionally because you're not able to communicate in real-time with other people.

First, be respectful of the other person's time by sending messages at appropriate times rather than constantly checking in to see if they've checked their inbox yet. Asynchronous communication can feel emotionally draining, as you're not communicating in real-time with team members and instead have to wait around for responses, so if something is urgent, make that clear.

If this sounds like something that might affect your productivity or happiness on a remote team, consider changing up how much asynchronous vs synchronous communication happens on your team. If you need to give feedback on this, do so.

### 7-Know the strengths of async vs sync.

Asynchronous communication is better for planning and asynchronous tasks, while synchronous communication works best in urgent or emotional situations where you need an immediate response from another person.

Synchronously communicating with your team will give them a more realistic sense of what it's like to work on a remote team since they'll be able to check things off their to-do list faster.

Synchronous communication is always better for urgent matters, but asynchronous actually often works best when you need people's undivided attention and time on a project or task.

And remember that async vs sync isn't an all-or-nothing type of thing, even for remote teams and hybrid teams. Many conversations happen somewhere in between, with elements of asynchronous and synchronous communication.

o2vkr8,"Remote onboarding has been super challenging for me, any tips to power through?","I'm having a very difficult time onboarding, probably made much harder by remote onboarding. In the past, I've onboarded much more easily.

It's been about 7 months, and feel like it's month 1, if that, in terms of how onboarding at my previous company went. Something has to change.

I'm not sure if it is because I'm onboarding as a senior engineer as well, I suspect that might be adding to the coldness and struggle to get relaxed and informal handholding help from someone. I don't want to bias and say where I'm working, but this is supposedly one of the best places to work in the world, and I nearly doubled my already pretty huge salary by accepting an offer here. I'm just totally mind blown that either I @#$%ing suck (part of it) or just their onboarding is god awful. I don't want to say the company as it will probably reveal who I am, but it's similar to Netflix in size and culture I would guess (at least it's public image before I joined and am fairly disappointed LOL!).

Some examples of challenges faced:

* I don't have a mentor
* I'm was given a mentor after asking, but they don't do anything close to what I do, was nice to talk to them a bit but the person always rubbed me like I was wasting their @#$%ing time, so we decided to stop meeting
* My manager isn't technical and can't help in any way other than say ""do it in parallel for greater productivity"" and similar. And also way too busy to help.
* On my first project, was able to find a mentor out of the closest person to this project.
   * Typical responses to questions were hours
   * Whenever we met on video, he would just dominate the conversation and go off on stories and hours pass without making much progress on the questions I'm screen sharing and want to discuss
   * I spent a lot of time building in our system and dealing with bugs here. Even while screen sharing, he never pointed out a very simple tool I should have been using that he uses every day to cache and speed up the build. Even when I explicitly asked several times, ""Surely you guys must have something to cache builds here? Is this what you do?""
   * Refused to screenshare and let me see how he worked, said it would be a waste of time
* Now 3 months in, on my second project, was also able to find a mentor out of the closest person on the project. Also have a new manager. Again though, the manager isn't technical, extremely busy, no help.
* Entire team is dead silent. There's no chat group, people talking about things, very little shared code and code review. No emails between teammates that I can tell. Everyone does their own thing and owns their own project with their own customers. We do somewhat similar things. I've asked just about everyone if there's a chat room I'm missing out on and told there isn't. I made one. No one really uses it, yet. I suspect/hope there are others like me that just were afraid to look different or make the first move.
* Throughout this time, I've been setting up 1:1s with people regularly (2-3 per week rotating around the team, nearby teams, and meeting people I see in the code blame), taking notes on what people do, trying to ask everyone a few questions and read and study the documentation as much as possible
* Everyone I've asked for a ""can I look over your virtual shoulder on how you use tool such and such"" or even just ""mind if we do a short pair programming or pair work / pair think for 20m, just grab me whenever for a video call"" have been shut down.
* I gave the ""can I look with anyone on what they're already doing"" ask in a team meeting as well, and my manager spoke up and said it was a poor idea and a waste of people's time, couldn't imagine why I would benefit from that. I explained that there's so much tribal knowledge and disconnect between the docs for the tools and actually using the tools, such as the check it and uncheck it random box is the secret to building some things (that no doubt wasted two hours of everyone on the team unless they got help or picked up on it from watching someone do it), that watching others work fluidly and being immersed will help a ton. (I didn't think this needs to be explained to anyone, but here I find myself)
* I eventually got a few people to screen share, and it was the weirdest experience. This one person shared the screen of a docs and was reading docs with me which is cool, finally getting somewhere. Then it turns out he was coding in a different monitor. When I realized this, I asked, can you share the coding screen or somehow work in one monitor for this session? He sighed, said no, that he works in two monitors. I asked okay can you share the one with code then? Another sigh and did it. He silently coded a few things, and then a long pause. I didn't want to interrupt him or anything, but after 5 minutes went by with silence and nothing happening, I asked ""watcha thinking?"", and he replied ""I'm thinking this is a waste of both of our time""
* The other person I screen shared with, this time I got to drive (woohoo, was not expecting that) would just bark micromanaged orders at me. ""Barrel equals"" ""drop dot seventeen dot data dot getBarrel parenthesis"" delete that line"" ""semicolon"" ""hover your mouse to the right"" ""more"" ""one more word"" ""Hit F1"" ""ctrl N"" , etc. for about 30 minutes. And this is the best help and mentorship I've received so far! HAHA

&#x200B;

I'm just flabbergasted as I reflect on what's happened actually haha. This is a company that I've read so many things about, such as on Quora, Medium, etc. and pays some of the highest salaries that exist for software engineering, as well as builds all sorts of cool stuff. I'm just really not sure what's going on. It's 7 months in now, and I feel like I don't know any of the people on my team, what they really do, what my manager wants me to do (I drafted up a document, but the yearly goals change nearly every time we meet, which is sometimes twice per week, and the weekly goals change constantly). I could solve it by driving it. But I don't understand the ecosystem enough to drive well. So I am sort of trying to make up things to do and shoot in the general direction, but it's sure slow going, as well as super annoying when what I did one week is not what I should have done and am somewhat reprimanded and put on the spot for it in the next week's meeting.

But here's the catch 22 - in order to switch teams, I have to deliver and perform. Any advice for improving? I'm definitely improving and slowly figuring things out, but by god would a little help from my teammates would be nice. When I onboarded two people on my last team remotely, I was one hell of a mentor compared to this. I would pair program and trade who's driving for about four hours a day for two weeks. And I got the time back right away because they were productive and doing great work on the projects I hired them for. I just don't understand what's so hard to get about that but whatever, I just need some advice to get past this and make the best of a bad situation.

I'm also not sure how healthy it is to rant like this. I have a nagging feeling I should ignore it and focus on the positive as much as possible. I'm not used to having so many things to complain about, so many expectations not being met in other words. It's a high paying job, and I'm sure once I'm over the onboarding and ""in"" with the team it would be much better. I have many friends on other teams here, and I know they would never do this crazy stuff I'm experiencing. The only explanation is that I landed in an extremely cliquey group that is not the norm here. Although if it's an ""in"" thing, I don't care to give the same experience to the next new guy or stay on the team.

EDIT: After thinking about this more, I am wondering if it's an everyone is enjoying the wfh life, working 4 productive hours per day with relationships they already have built up instead of 8 (or more), and just enjoying life more than working and grinding at the moment. And Mr. happy to jump in and work and debug and see what people are working on is ruining that for them. They can't explicitly come out and say that because I don't know, but maybe that's it. They are sort of playing the ""be busy and hope he bothers someone else game"". Just a thought. I'm not sure. I guess I have to figure out what video games these guys and gals play, or whatever it is they do and join the circle that way. From small talk before meetings, seems like everyone works all the time including weekends, but judging by how formal everything is and how unresponsive people are, pretty sure it's just optics for the big boss. I have met a few people on distant teams through the surf group and have gone out surfing, great people and exactly the type of nerdy extrovert ""build it all"" type people I would expect to run into here, so these two teams I'm onboarding with just really have thrown me a curveball.

**TL;DR:** Remote onboarding @#$%ing sucks, at least on this team, and no one is helping me help them, which I don't get. When I was the team lead on my previous team during the pandemic, I'd pair program, encourage people to informally chat and do team building exercises, and I got a return on my investment very quickly. Hit me with any advice on ways I can recover the situation into a more win-win, thank you.

Edit: After since hearing so many stories of this exact same thing here, I'm very convinced I'm not alone and won't be identifiable by saying the company is Google.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/o2vkr8/remote_onboarding_has_been_super_challenging_for/,1624037875.0,12,12,WFH
