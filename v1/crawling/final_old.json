So many people with WFH jobs who are SO salty about people even having the audacity to think they might be worthy enough to do the same. They also seem to feel that what happens at their job with their company is the only way to do things. \n\nThere are constant posts like this telling the little people who are lazy, uneducated, and stupid that they shouldn't even dare to think about landing a work from home job. If you go by these posts nobody gets these jobs unless they slaved for 20 years and have 12 years of college. \n\nThe truth is all of this varies wildly from company to company. Getting a WFH or hybrid job isn't as difficult as it was when some of these bitter people started out, and that seems to bother them. \n\nI work in corporate HR for a very large, very successful company. I started out as a temp in a different role with no experience or education. They liked me enough to offer me a new role when that one ended. I'm not rich and don't have a super high paying job, but for someone with my background it is nothing to scoff at. \n\nWe also deal with confidential info, but are expected to behave like adults with common sense. The occasional pet, child, or spouse sometimes shows up in the background of phone calls or meetings and nobody thinks twice. For my company it is explicitly stated that you are to have child care or not be the main care giver while working from home. However we all understand that sometimes a kid gets sick and things happen. That doesn't mean that person is lazy or unproductive. \n\nI just don't understand posting this in the first place. If someone is a lazy, unskilled pos, then they probably won't get a decent job of any kind or maybe they somehow fall into some wonderful dream job. If they suck, they probably won't keep it.

My commitment is to reply to everyone who follows the instructions as listed on this post. If you fail to follow them, I am unable to reply. \n\nAbout us: We are a fun, fast-paced, and driven 14-person marketing company based in the US with team members in the UK, India, the Philippines, Canada, and throughout the US. I am a Wall Street Journal best-selling author and we have a transformative company for our customers (and team!). We have a flow of people who want to hire us and buy our services and need help qualifying the leads! This is where you come in!\n\nThe Role: The role is straightforward... Potential customers will book a time on your calendar for about 20 minutes each appointment. You show up, ask them a few simple questions, and record their response. If they fit a criteria we share with you, you then schedule them on the Sales Closer's calendar. If they're not a good fit, you read a really nice script to tell them that we can't work with them (and give them a copy of my book for free).\n\nAlso, you will be starting conversations with prospects by phone\/SMS\/email, ensuring they're a good fit, and driving deals through the pipeline. We will provide a \"soft phone\" (it's an app for your phone or computer to do the dialing\/texting).\n\nThat's it! That is... unless you want more.\n\nOur company is rapidly growing and we want to bring in another committed team member who wants to grow within the company. There's plenty of room to grow in sales, marketing, content production, and operations if you're interested. Immediately, we need someone to help us \"triage\" the calls. I previously hired three GREAT women and a guy from here (the first was \\~2.5 years ago, the second was \\~1.5 years ago, and the third onboarded over the summer) and one of our hires is moving onto another role! We need her role filled. \n\nYou'll be reporting to a very friendly, helpful sales leader who is based in London.\n\nCompensation: Starting rate is $20\/hour, plus OTE bonuses for calls that close the deal. You will have full visibility into which calls close, and have regular communication with the closers, so you can optimize your efforts to earn more. We also have a bonus structure to incentivize you to quickly reach out to high quality leads instead of waiting for them to book a call on your calendar.\n\nThis is a GREAT role if you're HUNGRY and want to be in control of your income.\n\nWeekly Hours: Immediately, we are hiring for 20 hours\/week of support, with the opportunity to add more.\n\nNon-negotiables:\n\n* Attend our 60-min weekly on Tuesdays at 1:00-2:00pm Eastern on Zoom (on video)\n* Native English speaker\n* You'll be paid through Wise.com every 2 weeks (I'll pay more frequently for the first 2 weeks to reduce any concerns you have)\n* You must follow our Core Values, be positive and enthusiastic, be a problem solver, and be caring for the people you talk to. We'll share more about our Core Values to ensure you align after you reply.\n* You must have at least 20 hours of availability each week, and open to 30-40 hours\/week starting in September.\n\nLocation: I don't care where you live (but it probably makes sense for you to live in the Americas so that your timezone works better with our leads and team).\n\n30-day Paid Trial: We are looking for a long-term hire, though we will want to start with a \"date\" of 30 days first to see if we are a mutually good fit.

Permanent residents in these places could be replaced with temporary nomads who generally aren't paying any local income taxes (further fueling this short-term housing boom)\n\n Nobody likes paying taxes, but most places depend on it to run. Imagine what would happen if tons of people start shifting their residency to tax haven countries.    In the long term the sudden outflow of income taxes could be replaced with increase in sales taxes \/ other revenue from nomadic workers...but its going to take some time to adjust. This could mean higher taxes for local residents.\n\n The shift out of expensive cities could also cause a pretty dramatic decline in the residential real estate markets...which is good thing in the long run, but could cause some economic chaos in short term.\n\n3. Wages may plummet. Its not going to take long before companies converting to fully remote realize they can now open up once localized job positions to the global market. As we see with sites like Upwork, this typically drives wages down. I think a lot of people are going to lose their jobs to outsourced labor. This is going to further drive people out of cities propped up only by their relatively high wages. \n\n On the bright side it could also help life wages in places that typically don't attract large corporations.  But what happens to families who need to stay static? Their jobs are going to be driven to places with the lowest costs of living. I'm not sure how this will balance out.\n\n4. Impending commercial real estate crash. A lot of cities rely very heavily on companies maintaining large amounts of office space for their HQs. Some places are going to be hit hard by these companies all downsizing at once. Not to mention a lot of businesses in city centers rely heavily on traffic from commuters. \n\n I think in the long term this could lead to commercial property being converted to affordable real estate. But in the short term it could get ugly until cities adapt.\n\n5. Psychological damage ... I honestly don't think the vast majority of people will be happy working remote indefinitely. Right now many people are still in the \"honeymoon phase\" of work-from-home. But I think people are going to start reaching their breaking points (imagine being stuck in a tiny NYC apartment with 3 housemates all trying to WFH).  \n\n I know a lot of people who give up after a year or so  Maintaining work-life balance, isolation, and lack of work-developed friendships can take a serious toll. But companies could shift to shunning people who want to be in the office since it means more space they'll have to buy.\n\n6. Personal relationships can suffer. It can be extremely taxing to be stuck at home with your SO (or housemates) all day, every day. For parents with young kids it can be near impossible to work.  They need the escape of the office. Hopefully it doesn't become a situation mentioned in #5 where people are penalized for wanting office space.\n\nThere's plenty of positives too. Spending 9-5 in cubicles is soul destroying, people are going to get some of their life back. Its going to cut down on commuting\/traffic (good for the mind and the planet). It could bring property values down in cities that are unlivable right now. And both people and businesses save money. Lower commuting costs + lower office overhead.\n\n In my opinion the ideal scenario for most work places (and society) is a hybrid approach, involving 2-3 days at home \/ 2-3 days at the office each week. If people want to go full remote for a period of time they can. Companies can start offering full remote time on top of vacation time... allowing employees to take a couple months away to work elsewhere, but still maintaining some semblance of \"home base\". \n\nInterested to hear others thoughts on this? Do you think the DN tidal wave is coming? Good thing or bad thing?\n\n**edit** Some discussion points people bringing up! to be clear, I dont think most people will full time DN, I do think enough young workers will choose to explore it to make an impact. I also think there's going to be tons of part time \/ short duration nomads who could still create many of these effects in other ways.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"To be an employee of a US company you need the legal right to work in the US even if you're working remotely, which is often difficult.

There is no unicorn entry level job. $100k, fully remote, set your own hours, travel the world, etc etc. Most entry level remote work stinks, other than being remote. Call center type work\/phone work. Hard set hours\/breaks scheduled etc. To get the \"easier\" or more flexible jobs, you either have to have the experience (years not months) or work in a field that allows it. Those fields usually require formal training, software\/engineering etc.\n2. Work ethic. Don't assume it always means selling your soul to the company\/working 90 hours a week etc. Work ethic is also where people can rely on you to get your work done efficiently, correctly and reliably. Nothing makes you more valuable when no one has to remind you about something. \n3. New companies will (usually) pay more than your current job will do as a raise. Use LinkedIn and occasionally update it with work only stuff. React to posts etc. Recruiters will reach out to you. However, don't jump jobs just for jumping jobs. To get some of the perks, remote etc, you have to stay somewhere for a bit. \n4. One field people tend to avoid is sales. Whenever someone hears sales, they think car sales type dynamic. Most higher end sales roles are more account manager type. Relationship building. Product knowledge etc. Find a niche and run with it. This is what I do. Im fully remote.

For nearly a decade, Thailand has attracted remote workers who seek the sun, sea, and a vibrant nightlife. This bustling destination is not only beautiful but it's also known for its comfortable co-working spaces, affordability, and remote working communities.\n\nHowever, the overall sentiment about remote workers hasn't been good lately due to two recent trends. First, remote working communities in Thailand have faced some scrutiny due to a recent incident in Chiang Mai. Second, the image of backpackers is tainted due to the newly emerged trend of the so-called, \"Fund My Trip\" beggars.\n\nAs a result, local law enforcement officers are pressuring remote workers and backpackers who raise their suspicion to leave the country or pay a fine. Knowing the laws, rules, and regulations ahead of time is key to a happy, remote-working lifestyle. Besides, better safe than sorry, right?\n\n**Thailand's Stance on 'Digital Nomads'**\n\nRemote workers plotting their next destination\nThailand's stance on remote working laws wasn't particularly clear until an anonymous tip led to false accusations of a digital nomad community in October 2014.\n\nPunSpace, a popular working space for digital nomads in Chiang Mai, was raided by the police after allegations of a suspicious criminal conspiracy. Luckily, after the remote workers explained the nature of their business, no charges were made.\n\nThe Thailand Immigration Officers state that working as a 'digital nomad' and running your own business online is not a problem. So, working remotely in Thailand should be a piece of cake, right?\nNot exactly. Over the last few years, international travelers have faced heavy repercussions from law enforcement authorities due to a new trend called, 'begpacking'. It typically involves Western backpackers arriving empty-handed in Asian countries and begging locals to fund their trips.\n\n**Begpacking: Troubling Image of Foreigners**\n\nIllegal activities such as begpacking give Thailand's Government a bad image of foreigners. Therefore, the Thailand Government would rather have companies hire a Thai citizen than an immigrant who could conspire in illegal activities. Border patrols have beefed up their security and have reportedly begun denying entry to internationals who are suspect to do begpacking activities.\n\nDo you still want to work remotely in Thailand?\n\nIf yes, keep reading. Here's what you should and shouldn't do as a remote worker in Thailand.\n\n**What you SHOULDN'T do:**\n\nMake sure you do not enter any direct business transaction with a Thai company or Thai individual. Any activity that involves a cash flow of income, such as a job, from a Thai company should be avoided if you're a tourist. For more details visit the Thai Embassy's website.\nIf you do intend to do business or start a project while living in Thailand, change your tourist visa into a Non-Immigrant Business Visa.\n\nIf you want to stay in Thailand, but still make a living, change your tourist visa into a Non-Immigrant Business Visa\n3. Don't come to Thailand empty-handed! There have been reports from Thailand's Visa website stating that people must have 20,000 baht in cash, which is the equivalent of 510EUR!

Also, keep all your business in your private computer to avoid unnecessary questioning. You don't want to confuse the immigration officer.\n2.

Obviously getting a job is never that easy. But .. you know what I mean. \n\nThe impression I've gotten so far is not that. I've landed interviews, but mostly by leveraging a couple of connections. I'm getting the feeling that the slush pile for remote opportunities posted on the internet is kind of enormous. I think that I can eventually get there. But it's by no means a walk in the park.\n\nWhat has folks experience been? Is it very much dependent upon what you do?

I own a business that designs PDF worksheets for pre-k to 3rd grade. Topics include math, literacy, science, and art. These printable resources are generally used by professional educators, but we have a small homeschool audience as well. I'm looking to add another worksheet designer to the team.\n\n**Description of Work**\n\nYou won't need to come up with any original ideas for worksheets; you'll only be editing premade templates. You won't even need to create your own images\/graphics -- we'll be using an image library for that.\n\nHere's how it works for creating a single resource:\n\n1. I'll provide you with a premade editable ['template' page](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1Bw6ittmMRiuFFq_6Wct4_7l21-1IaBhW\/view?usp=sharing) in Sketch.\n2. I'll give you [directions](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1a2dTrKhoScn3XDgN7vmez2kxfPpCi3OA\/view?usp=share_link).\n3. You'll use this to expand the template into a [full set of pages](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1PBGK3K_kM4KxskVXah-npqaCZoW0NtVu\/view?usp=share_link).\n4. You'll import these pages into [InDesign](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ESJgCv1XJRNr6BtsDGzGPK8sjYa_Uweu\/view?usp=share_link).\n5. You'll export the InDesign file as a [final PDF](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/101ccC8Fce0c3sYbbwHdTwEXWU06XUpUM\/view?usp=share_link).\n\nAs you can see, this process is highly structured and very quick; the pages you're creating are all just very simple edits of the template. No original designs needed. It's quite different from the usual graphic design work.\n\nThis position is 100% remote, with absolutely no set 'hours' you have to be on-call. No meetings, no micromanagement... work completely on your own time!\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\nThis is a 6 month contract, from February 1 - July 31. In this span, you'll need to create 90 final, print-ready resources (having gone through all 5 steps in the 'Description of Work' section). Each resource ranges between 10-30 pages, averaging around \\~20. That's approximately 1800 pages in total.Deadlines are only assessed on a 3-week basis, meaning 18 resources are due every 3 weeks, with a 1-week break in between. You can spread out the work evenly throughout each 3-week segment, or steamroll through it all at once. Doesn't matter to me, as long as 18 are finished every 3 weeks.\n\nThere is also the opportunity to renew this contract for another 6 months if things go well.\n\n**Software**\n\n1. [Sketch](https:\/\/www.sketch.com): All pages will be designed in Sketch. I know this is an unusual choice for layout design, but it has an incredibly fast workflow, intuitive graphics editing, and a low learning curve. It's okay if you don't know Sketch ahead of time; we'll start out with pretty easy stuff. You'll pick it up quickly, I promise -- and I'll pay for your monthly subscription.\n2. [Noun Project](https:\/\/thenounproject.com): A comprehensive asset library where we source all of our images. I'll pay for your monthly subscription here too.\n3. [InDesign](https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/products\/indesign.html): After the individual pages are designed in Sketch, you'll import them into InDesign in order to combine them into a single file and export the print-ready PDF. You must provide your own InDesign subscription.\n\n**Skills**\n\nThis is more of a 'layout designer' position than 'graphic designer,' so you'll need to be able to work accurately within a tightly-defined structure.

We're hiring a React \/ React Native \/ TypeScript developer to help make this happen. The company is remote-first, impact-driven, and has an emphasis on healthy culture. This position will be our first employee, which means lots of agency and a good chunk of equity for the right candidate. Read on for details!\n\nInsomnia is widespread (70M+ in the US alone), harmful (more car accidents, heart attacks, etc), and neglected (problem is growing, there are almost no sleep therapists, and doctors don't want to prescribe more sleeping pills). With Dozy, users record their sleep and enter health info, which the app uses to customize the program and nudge towards healthy habits. For additional support, a human sleep coach provides support over chat.\n\nThis role focuses primarily on front-end mobile app development, with some backend work - all in TypeScript. Your work will involve:\n\n* Adding features and fixing bugs in our company's flagship mobile app\n* Adding features and fixing bugs in internal tools, like the sleep coach dashboard, a few ReTool dashboards, and more\n* Reviewing PRs, helping each other improve\n* Designing system and data architecture, improving it over time\n* Optimizing app performance and filesize for a range of devices\n* Occasional open source contributions to relevant libraries\n\nThe ideal candidate will be a highly competent JavaScript and TypeScript developer, comfortable with some ambiguity \/ able to act in uncertainty, impact-driven, capable of writing clean and documented code, and a quick learner. Bonus points for experience with Expo, Firebase, native app development, ReTool, Figma, and Notion. This role can be done remotely, but preference will be given to those in US timezones. Compensation will vary depending on your seniority, qualifications, and location. There are a few contract team members, but you'd be employee #1 - as such, you'd get a good chunk of equity. Salary starts below market rates ($45-$90k) until a seed round 4ish months from now, at which point we'd pay closer to market rates.\n\nIn joining, you can expect a strongly purpose-driven work environment with ambitious coworkers, lots of flexibility, and a culture that prioritizes your health and growth just as much as we do our users'. As the company grows, your role will too. To apply, follow this link ([https:\/\/angel.co\/l\/2wmjfx](https:\/\/angel.co\/l\/2wmjfx)). Please share a resume, and optionally share either links to projects you've worked on (bonus points for open source) or a code sample.\n\nIf you like impact, tech, design, and having a large influence through your work, you'll likely enjoy this role.

But before the pandemic and now, I only do my day job and freelance work online. Everything else is in person. I participate in community events, work out, attend dance class and pilates, eat brunch, and am in 2 book clubs. I also have a workstation in my home that's only for work. When I worked in person, I developed the bad habit of eating at my desk but now I eat in my kitchen and then go outside - to walk around the block or to run an errand.\n\nTo answer your question, I have coworkers who live alone. One of them loves it because she's been able to live in a gorgeous place without family or roommates for the first time. She has a large friend group outside of work and travels quite a bit. It seems like there's always a wedding, birthday party, family reunion, or baby shower on her calendar. \n\nAnother single coworker who is an expat and doesn't have family in the UUS wanted to work in the office as much as possible. She also said she learned better in person.

As a surfer and someone who loves being outside and having time and freedom, this is by far my favorite job ever as its part-time hours with the ability to set your own schedule and work from anywhere (while still earning six figures). If this sounds too good to be true...keep reading...i thought the same thing.For the record I basically had no sales experience prior to starting except a little cold calling for a networking company which made me hate sales lol. Luckily learning about High ticket sales changed my perspective when i learned that you could talk to people who are reaching out to YOU for help and are booking calls to chat with your company on your calendar.\n\nIf you don't know what a high ticket remote closer is, it is essentially a sales job where you close warm inbound appointments over 20-45 minute phone calls. Typically you work for agencies, or influencers who are selling $3000 to $10,000+ products and services and it is usually 100% commission-based (10-20%).\n\nAnyway so I had heard about remote closing from a friend but I didn't know where to start. After months of floundering I eventually i found a health influencer who sells a $3500 coaching program for people with diabetes to help them figure out lifestyle + diet. She needed help handling the inbound inquiries for her coaching and we agreed that I would collect 15% commission for every new client i closed = $525 each closed call. She has 100k+ highly engaged followers who ADORE her and love her advice and health tips so when i get on the phone with prospects they are already excited about the program and working with the influencer. All i have to do is ask them questions to go over their challenges\/obstacles and their goals, and then pitch the program and collect payment.\n\nI work 1-3 hours a day because i take around 1-4 phone calls a day on average and the calls are short. Afterward, I will usually spend around 30 minutes or so conducting follow-up, organizing CRM etc. If i close a deal a day that's $525 a day which equates to $10,500 a month. Since i value my time above all else I opt for this number of calls but you can see how if i took more calls the numbers could add up to 15-20k months easily.So yeah i have been doing this for the past year and a half and its been incredible. There's TONS of these influencers and agency owners out there who want to offload taking phone calls to a closer so they can focus on growing their biz. So i HIGHLY suggest giving this a shot if you want to still earn a lot and value your free time like me. Thats my story. If this helps just one person become a remote closer then i've won :D\n\nLet me know what questions you have!- Victor (remotesalesguy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: For the NAYSAYERS and close minded folks, Here is a much better explanation of High ticket sales.

Our main angle is exploring and exposing partisanship in a clear, simple manner; aside from our neutral, objective take on every story, on controversial political stories we publish two editorials -- one from the left and one from the right. We publish an optimistic and pessimistic editorial on controversial, non-political-axis-aligned stories (certain rapprochement with North Korea stories, for example). The overarching goal is short-form, factual, citation-heavy news. We have a live site at https:\/\/knowhere.ai (soon to move to https:\/\/knowherenews.com) as well as a Twitter feed @KnowhereNews if you'd like to examine some of our recent material.\n\nAs to available roles, we're currently trying to fill timeslots on our reporting team to achieve twenty-four hour live coverage of breaking events. Our team is US-west-coast based and currently online between roughly 6AM - 7PM PST every day, so our focus is filling the remainder, which most closely aligns with UK daytime hours. That said, English-speaking night owls and early birds in other locations are more than welcome to apply.\n\nThe position is remote, online, flexible, and compensated between $15-20 USD per hour (via PayPal or other reputable billing system of choice) depending on journalism experience and the quality of your writing. We also offer goal-based bonuses. We'll start with a (paid) trial week - there are style guides and other onboarding material to work through - and continue on to a full contract if the trial goes well.\n\nPlease contact me at dylan@knowhere.ai or here on Reddit with an intro, resume, and writing sample if you are interested; one of my cofounders will be in the UK next week and could conduct in-person interviews then for any applicants in the greater London area. Otherwise, contact will have to be electronic.\n\nI'd encourage you to reach out if you're at all interested; this is an easy, low-commitment opportunity to get your feet wet in journalism with a growing outlet. Our current reporting team seems very happy and have all been with us for 6-9 months at this point.  I'm also happy to answer any more specific questions you might have about the position.\n\nHope to hear from you!\n\nEdit: I realized my writing wasn't completely clear above.

I was so relieved and excited to have gotten the job since it is a competitive position that I worked very hard for, and was looking forward to the change of pace as I've been going through the stress of IVF and recently discovered I am pregnant. I wanted to be in the comfort of my home in case I needed to frequently use the bathroom, give myself the IVF meds or suddenly feel the urge to puke. The job itself is also a perfect fit and my colleagues seem to be really great.\nHowever, what I didn't factor in was that they are expecting me to train in-office, and there's a catch: I won't just be training at the office near my home where I'll be working, the other people in my position who are training me are located all around, in offices up to an hour away from my home. The traffic during rush hour coming home has been also been awful, yesterday an hour and a half, and has impacted my IVF medication schedule and causing tons of stress.\nI am a very professional and reasonable person, and initially understood and did not at all mind coming in person to shadow and learn the new documentation system and work flow. But the other issue is that no one knows how long this will be going on for, since I still do not have access to the remote EMR after three weeks (I did the training already and access was requested by the manager) and they are essentially just having me shuttle around so I can be paid to do something. As of right now, I feel like I can start my job at home without issue if only I could get the remote access. I feel like I'm back in the rat race every morning and come home completely drained.

I have a somewhat crazy idea that I'd like to run by all you digital nomads. This will be a long-ish post but I'd appreciate any and all feedback! I am an engineer with a company in the shipping\/logistics industry with an office staff of \\~50 and 400 total employees, so my work does have a decent impact\/value to the company even though I'm entry level. This is my first job out of college, and I have been with the company 4.5 years (I'm 26 years old). I make good money ($80k) and have full benefits. Most employees have been working remotely for the past 4 months due to COVID. I am not a programmer and more along the lines of mechanical engineering\/project management, but our company heavily uses the cloud (Microsoft Sharepoint, Teams, etc.) for document storage, teleconferencing, etc. and I have largely been able to do my work (design review, vendor interaction, etc.) from home. My direct boss is 77 years old and relies on me for a lot, but so far he has also done decently well with remote work (although I'm sure he'd prefer to be in the office). Overall our company culture is decently laid back (flexible hours, not picky with sick time, etc.) and is more focused on getting work done, but there is an expectation that people will return to the office at some point.\n\nHowever, during quarantine I met a friend that owns their own small business and is planning on living in a van around the country for the next year or two. Seeing their lifestyle and overall passion for life made me realize that I am missing out on exploring the world we live in and meeting some amazing people along the way. I go to the same office every day (well, before COVID), see the same people, and do the same things every weekend. It's not a bad life, especially with the pay and benefits, but I'm realizing that it is stagnant, and this is the prime time in life to explore. So, I have been thinking of ways that I can possibly keep my job while doing some traveling. I don't want to quit my job, partially due to student loans and partially because I don't know what I'd do instead. Assuming my direct boss approves, my proposal to the president of the company (a younger, fairly approachable guy) would be something like this, spoken as if I'm talking to the president:\n\n1. I've been with your company for almost 5 years, and love the work we do, the people, and the company culture, and I'm looking forward to many more years of working here.\n2. However, I've realized that outside of work all I have known is Midwest USA, and there's a whole world that I'm missing out on seeing. This is the prime time in my life to explore (no wife, kids, etc.) and I have a strong desire to expand my worldview. \\[this may sound like millennial BS to the president, but I'm hoping to find a good way to be honest but sound serious\\]\n3. I've worked from home for 4 months during COVID and my boss and I feel that I am as effective as I was while working in the office.\n4. I would ask that I be given the option to work remotely 3 months (not necessarily consecutive) out of the year), with the expectation that I would always be available for calls\/meetings during standard office hours, that the quality of my work would not diminish, and that I would make myself available in the office (with enough notice) for major meetings\/events. Benefits (401k, insurance, etc.) would not be affected.\n5. I understand that your expectation is that employees eventually return full-time to the office, but as a benefit to you I would propose that I take a 25% decrease in base salary. \\[I could also phrase this simply as I'm willing to take a decrease in salary in an amount that we can discuss would be mutually agreeable\\].\n6. I love working for this company, and this arrangement would allow my to greatly improve my overall life satisfaction while maintaining my commitment to you and the company. I'd appreciate you giving this some thought. Thanks.\n\nI've done the math and I can comfortably afford a 25% pay cut with my current lifestlye. I am planning on buying a duplex and living in one side, which would save me $15000 a year in rent. In another 1.5 years I'll have my student loans paid off, saving me another $17000 per year. Basically, with those two savings I can maintain my current lifestyle on $39000 pre-tax salary while still putting the max match in my 401k. \n\nSo, am I crazy? Any recommendations for negotiating this? Thanks and happy traveling!","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"I'm not sure this is the right sub to ask this.

Many people report that the first 2 hours after waking are their most productive; are we really asking them to spend those precious hours commuting? It does make some sense from the companies perspective, because the company doesn't pay for this time, nor do they usually directly pay for the cost of the commute (which can often take a hefty chunk out of your wage).\"\n\n\"There's a large portion of the population who fit this description, and without casting any negative judgement, we have to be open and honest with candidates that if they're in this camp - they'll likely be unhappy working at Supabase.

We actively try to reduce the number of meetings happening across the company (both in person and via video call) which increases friction with these folks. By not supporting this group, we're reducing the size of the population from which we can hire, but overall our hiring pool is still very much larger than the average in-person company.... **After all, the goal of hiring should be to source the absolute best person for the job. Statistically speaking it's unlikely that this person lives within an hour drive to your office.**\"\n\n\"...

You could look into an English teaching role in non-English speaking countries, or you could just do odd local work (it's very common with tourists in Australia, they can do anything from some unskilled farm helper work, call centres, charity chuggers, even hospitality work). A family friend travelled throughout Eastern Europe just working hospitality jobs. Another friend taught English in China (they were based there for sometime however). \n\nAs far as remote work, the only thing you could likely do at the moment is odd menial tasks. Take a look at some of the freelancing listings and see what you can find that you can do. The less skilled work often won't pay much at all, but that's you're only option there. If you do decide to go this way, there is quite a high level of risk, I imagine much higher than a freelancer doing skilled work. So you might want to have a backup plan if that falls through (you end up without work for a few months). Or you could start another kind of business, but that's not necessarily a quick nor guaranteed way to become a digital nomad. \n\nAs far as what you want to do for your career. If you're considering coding, then before you make any big commitments just start looking at what areas interest you, and start playing around with the languages and tools that go along with it. You'll get an idea of whether it is something you enjoy or not (though some people are able to make it work and don't enjoy it at all, but I think you're always better doing something you enjoy). As far as doing it to lead to a digital nomad lifestyle, it certainly can, but it might not be anytime soon. While some people are able to get into it very quickly, I've known one person who was able to go from 2 months of self learning to a remote job, and some others that only took 1 year (all whose first job was remote). Those people are the outliers though. So I wouldn't plan on that happening. \n\nI think if you're wanting to get out there and travel straight after school. Your best bet right now is to forget the digital nomad idea, and just do local work (teaching English or some other kind of work; just research whatever is the best way for the country you want to go to). After that there's nothing stopping you from teaching yourself some coding on the side or taking some short courses. \n\nWhatever you decide to do, just make sure you have built up some savings (preferably at least enough for a return flight + some nights at a hotel and days worth of food\/other expenses; the more the better but at least with that you at least have something to fall back on if everything goes wrong). Also when budgeting it (whatever your income will be) that you're including any taxes (these may be from the country your visiting or your home), what ongoing expenses you have back home (rent, bills, loan repayments, etc.), and then what your costs may be in the country you'll be visiting (I suggest adding a bit more to whatever the totals will be).","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"Hi I have over 8 years of experience working in customer service.

(His department is the one that doesn't have funding, not the company as a whole)\n\nTo be clear, I can't relocate because the work he offers is project-based freelance. I can't live on that.

When I told them I couldn't use mine (notified them before the start date), they sent me a wiped laptop that never arrived (delivery link says delayed for a week). They know this, and now they're saying that I need to find a way to connect to their VPN by tomorrow or they'll terminate me. I had offered to push my start date to after the laptop issue was sorted, but they said no -- I was supposed to receive my first paycheck on 5\/13, but I haven't, and I'm worried that they're going to withhold my income even though they told me that I would be paid despite knowing I didn't have the laptop yet. My questions are:\n\n(1) Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and would I not qualify for unemployment? I live in Illinois, even though the job is in Ohio.\n\n(2) If they withhold my income from the first 10 days of work, is there anything I can do about it? I read online that federal law only requires employers to compensate minimum wage for hours worked and that's all I'd be guaranteed to receive, even if my offer letter stated my salary.\n\n(3) Is my frustration here fair? Like, would it be reasonable for them to expect me to just use my own computer for this job even if they didn't say that during the hiring process?\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI recently accepted a data science job offer from a large hospital, where I would be working with sensitive data. They advertised the position as remote friendly, and sent me an offer letter (I did not sign a contract, since I thought it best to keep things as flexible as possible). They were aware that I would be working 100% remotely.\n\nIt is standard in data science (unless you're part of a very small non-profit or start-up) to receive your computer equipment from the employer (most data scientists need a laptop at the least, and many also receive monitors or docking systems), so this is what I expected in this position. A couple of days before my scheduled start date, I realized that they had never formally told me that they were sending me any equipment. I reached out and asked, and they said that they expected me to use a VPN and Remote Desktop to connect to their on-campus computers for the job (without ever clarifying whether I had the tools to do this myself), and that he could give me a $100 Amazon gift card to \"furnish my office\". He reassured me that this setup was perfectly safe, though the security configuration stuff isn't my purview.\n\nMy computer sucks and wouldn't function properly for this, and beyond that, I wasn't comfortable with the idea of using my personal computer for work in any sense ($100 wouldn't make a dent in the cost of a new one). I (politely) told my boss that I couldn't use a personal computer and needed a company laptop for the job, and that the job description never said that I would be expected to furnish my own equipment. He said that they could send me a retired 2-3 year old laptop as a \"gift\" - which I found strange because it felt like they were trying to dissociate themselves from the computer and made me worried about liability working with sensitive data. He added that the entire thing had been wiped and I would be expected to install a new operating system myself (specifically, Microsoft 10 and would need to purchase the $150 license); IT also said that sending me a fully set up company laptop would not be the \"best use of resources\". I asked them if I would be reimbursed for this, and whether the Amazon gift card could be put towards this instead, and my boss said I should be happy I'm getting a free laptop and that I should offer them flexibility because they had been flexible with me working two positions at the same time (they made the conscious choice to hire me, knowing that upfront). He rescinded the $100 offer and said he'd \"try\" to lump the reimbursement into my signing bonus, which I declined because that can be retracted if I leave within a year of my hire - but I said I would do my best to install a free operating system and let them know how that goes, and they agreed. I told them that I'm also happy to push my start date (5\/2) to after the laptop issue had been resolved, and they said no, and that they would still pay me and I could focus on other tasks in the meantime (like onboarding, research, and reviewing SQL).\n\nThe laptop was supposed to arrive on 5\/6, but it never did and the tracking link says \"delayed\" indefinitely. It's been over a week now and boss is saying that I have to find a way to connect to the VPN tomorrow, or they'll terminate me, unless I choose to move to Ohio for the job instead. I also checked Workday and saw that I was supposed to be paid on 5\/13, but I never received the deposit and I'm worried they'll try to withhold it. Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and can they legally withhold my income from the first week even though they knew that I didn't receive the laptop from them?","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"My remote work pays 41,000.00.

I worked at a tech startup downtown for 2.5 years. Did business analytics and operations, but had many other responsibilities. Great experience overall. Young workplace (mostly 20s to early 30s) ~150 employees. Entirely in person (which wasn't an issue for me because I live close to downtown and it was an about a 15 min commute). Lots of company parties, social events, etc. I knew it wasn't a long term career, but enjoyed it while it lasted. Unfortunately, the company didn't make it and I was laid off over the summer of 2023. Luckily I was marketable and able to land a new job quickly. \n\nI am about 4 months into a new fully remote job at a much larger (30,000+ employees), established company. Doing business analytics and sales operations. Moving from to this job has been a huge shock for me. \n\n1. I HATE WFH. I had a few remote internships in college during Covid, and I hated those too. I have severe ADHD, and I'm a very social person. I loved my previous job because it provided great social opportunities and the office was very stimulating. It also provided great separation from home life. I am struggling with the remote work because I cannot focus and my apartment is tiny with 2 roommates who also have fully remote jobs. I purposely paid more money for a smaller apartment close to downtown and have a pleasant commute for my previous job. \n\n2. Zero social opportunities. All of my new coworkers are based in other cities and I'll likely never meet them in person. Working downtown enhanced the experience of city living. It was great to meet coworkers and do things after work with them. Now I'm paying all this rent to live close to downtown when I no longer need to. When my lease expires in 8 months I may move to the inner suburbs so I can get more space for lower rent. This tiny apartment is giving me major cabin fever, and there's barely enough space to fit my WFH setup in my room. I can't really work at cafes either because I need multiple screens when I actually have stuff to do. And I don't want to pay for a WeWork spot.\n\n3. I have maybe 2 hours of work a day. My boss is reaching retirement age and it seems like he's already mentally checked out with this company. I have nothing valuable to do. I'm worried I'll get laid off again if that doesn't change. My boss won't even do biweekly 1 on 1s or anything. When I ask for more work he says he doesn't have anything for me at the moment. I have no clue why they even hired me for this position. There is zero need for it. But this company is also very inefficient. Lots of other people on the payroll who do literally nothing. \n\nI'm not sure what to do with all this extra time every day. I originally would just play video games or scroll on my phone until someone hmu with work, but I want to be more productive. I've been studying for the GRE\/GMAT because I'm considering grad school but not sure what else to do. I kinda want to use this time to get a sneaky second remote job, do freelance work, pursue a new passion, or learn something new. But I'm at a blank. I have no idea where to start.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"**About Us**\n\nBit9 + Carbon Black is a leading provider of endpoint threat detection and response (ETDR) solutions.

In the office, managers usually aren't hovering over peoples screens all day getting minute by minute updates of what everyone is working on.  So why should there be a special requirement to do this for remote employees?  \n\nBasically, if managers suddenly don't know what an employee is working on just because they went remote then that is a failure of the management.

During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single related job offer but I didn't even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used and it worked for me. I also used a few tools that ended up being very useful.\n\nAfter 2 months of using that preparation system, I was offered 3 positions! 2 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company.\n\nI learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on \"Mastering that stage only\" and improving on 1 metric:\n\n**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume** **(metric: Conversion rate from CV sent to first interview scheduled):**\n\nMy main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to f*irst interview scheduled*).\n\nI did this:\n\n* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).\n* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don't find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.\n* Create a cover letter \"template\" and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company\n* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a \"Website URL\" (asked in many offers)\n\nOnce I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.\n\n**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR) (metric: Conversion rate to second interview with manager)**\n\nIn this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.\n\nYou'll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with \"Hard Questions in Job Interviews\" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen \n\n**3 Use case (or technical exercise) (Metric: Job offers received)**\n\nMy metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance.  \n\n\nHere are the tools that played a significant role in that process:\n\n**1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer**\n\nYou start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt\n\n>As ChatGPT, you'll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \\_\\_\\_\\_. I'll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you'll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond.  \n \n\nThen you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt\n\n>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume.  \n \n\nThen ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.\n\n**2 kickresume**\n\nUse it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven't tried it yet but it looks promising.\n\n**3 Wave Coaching**\n\nIt provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I'm so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE.

During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand!\n\n**5 Interview Warmup (from Google)**\n\nSimilar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve.

It's not always company issued laptops. At my last job, we had to install something called Citrix, which simply lets you access the remote work computer associated with your employment. It's literally the same computer if I walked into the office and sat down. Typically, work desktops aren't actual physical machines, but rather a cloud instance. The machines you see in office are simply just hooked up to receive and emulate the cloud instance. It's why you're able to go to the office and sit at ANY cubicle desk, sign in, and literally get the same emulation of your assigned work computer. Same thing happens at home when you use a client called Citrix (or whatever you're assigned to use).\n\nAt my current job, we have work issued laptops, and that works differently in that things are local to this specific machine.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"A lot of companies are shifting their helpdesk\/support operations from call centers in India to people who work from \"home\". One person with a remote customer support job could be answering calls from 10+ different companies, following a script to help the people, and only escalating to an expert at that company if they can't solve the issue. \n\nTons of companies do this, from banks and insurance companies to tech companies like Apple. If you call a number to reach a company to ask about a product, chances are you're now connected to someone sitting at home in their pajamas instead of in a cubicle in India.\n\nI always thought this was a great move because I have problems understanding accents from non-native English speakers and it's great to hear a native English speaker answer the phone when I'm calling for help. It also means they can have a huge pool of people available so hold times are shorter.

Here's a copy of the full text:\n\n## How to Find a Remote Job\n\n\n### Remote Companies\n\nThere are a growing number of companies that are entirely distributed (all of their employees are remote). A few of the most well-known distributed companies that hire remote workers are:\n\n\n\n*   [Automattic (creators of WordPress)](https:\/\/automattic.com\/work-with-us\/)\n*   [Buffer](https:\/\/journey.buffer.com\/)\n*   [Zapier](https:\/\/zapier.com\/jobs\/)\n\nThese three companies are pioneers in the world of remote work. They are discovering, solving, and blogging about the challenges of running a remote enterprise, with employees spread out all over the world. \n\nLanding a job with one of these companies means that, not only will you be able to work remotely, but also that you will have the full support of your colleagues and your manager, since they will be remote workers too. No more grumpy coworkers or bosses jealous of your freedom. \n\nBut these are not the only companies that are hiring remote workers. Forbes published a list of [The Top 100 Companies For Remote Jobs](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/laurashin\/2018\/01\/17\/work-from-home-2018-the-top-100-companies-for-remote-jobs\/#754e88576f07) in 2018. The people at Remotive.io also put together a list of over 900 [companies that are hiring remote workers](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE\/edit#gid=1279011369). \n\nIt's great to see so many companies embracing remote work, from small businesses with less than ten employees, up to corporate giants like Amazon, Dell, and Hilton. The challenge though, is that these lists only include company names and some basic information about the companies, not the details of the specific remote jobs that they are offering. And not all of the jobs that those companies offer are remote jobs. They might only allow remote work for a few specific positions. So how can you find a comprehensive list of available remote jobs?\n\n\n### Remote Job Boards\n\nThe easiest way to find a list of available jobs is to check a remote job board. These websites list remote jobs from variety of companies and industries:\n\n\n\n*   [https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/](https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/) (paid)\n*   [https:\/\/remoteok.io\/](https:\/\/remoteok.io\/)\n*   [https:\/\/weworkremotely.com\/](https:\/\/weworkremotely.com\/)\n*   [https:\/\/www.skipthedrive.com\/](https:\/\/www.skipthedrive.com\/)\n*   [https:\/\/pangian.com\/job-travel-remote\/](https:\/\/pangian.com\/job-travel-remote\/)\n*   [https:\/\/remote.co\/remote-jobs\/](https:\/\/remote.co\/remote-jobs\/)\n*   [https:\/\/remotive.io\/](https:\/\/remotive.io\/)\n*   [https:\/\/dynamitejobs.co\/](https:\/\/dynamitejobs.co\/)\n*   [https:\/\/remote4me.com\/#jobs](https:\/\/remote4me.com\/#jobs)\n*   [https:\/\/www.outsourcely.com\/](https:\/\/www.outsourcely.com\/)\n\nThere is a lot of overlap between these remote job board websites, but it is still a good idea to check as many as you can, because there is no single, comprehensive list of all the jobs. You may find a job that is listed on one website, but not on the others.\n\nSome \"traditional\" job boards also include remote jobs among the other listings. Try doing a search and entering, \"remote\" in the location field ([it works on Indeed.com](https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/jobs\/?rbl=Remote)).\n\nJob boards are great for finding available remote jobs, but they almost make it _too easy _to find and apply for remote jobs. As a result, your application can get lost among a sea of others.\n\n\n### Social Networks\n\nSocial networks can be a great alternative approach to finding and applying for remote jobs. \n\n**LinkedIn**\n\nYou can find [remote jobs listed on LinkedIn](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/search\/?keywords=%22remote%22&location=Remote&locationId=OTHERS.remote) using their search tool. Applying for a remote job via a social network like LinkedIn ties your application to your profile, which makes it feel more dynamic and personal than simply emailing a resume.\n\n**Angel.co**\n\nThe startup-focused website and social network, [angel.co, lists open jobs at startup companies, including some that are designated with \"Remote Ok\"](https:\/\/angel.co\/job-collections\/remote).

I like the work. I like my boss and coworkers. The pay is decent. I'm a responsible, hard worker with many years of experience and I can be trusted to do my work productively with no supervision. The problem is my employer's policies are, in my opinion, incredibly overbearing and treat me as if I'm an untrustworthy child.  I'm heavily monitored and micromanaged. Therefore, I'm thinking about looking for a new job but I'm worried that the way my company does things is now \"the norm\" and I wouldn't find a better situation so I don't know if it's worth bothering. \n\nAt my job, I am required to be on camera all day,  every day, so they can take frequent photos of me to make sure I'm working. I HATE this. It's not because I'm lazy. I'm always at my desk working other than bathroom breaks. It's because I feel it is incredibly invasive and I feel like I can't scratch my face or eat a snack without someone watching. When you're at work in person,  your boss doesn't sit across from you staring at you intensely all day, and I feel the constant camera monitoring is the equivalent of that. I'm also not allowed to listen to music, have my phone, or have pets or another person in the room. The stated reason for the last few is fraud concerns, despite the fact I have no access to sensitive info. In my opinion, to want this much control over me and what goes on in my home is ridiculous.\n\nOn social media I see other WFH people talking about napping and going to the gym during the workday.

Then, there was this guy who (IMO) was taking advantage of this. He consistently worked from home when only living a few miles from the office. I don't think it posed too many problems with regards to productivity, but I do think it created a bit of animosity in the office, as I'm sure people were envious of him. For reasons like this, I think it would be good for companies to have a policy in place that would state when they would or wouldn't allow for remote work.\n\nFor example:\n\n* Periodically for people whose kids must stay home that day\n* For those who live too far from the office\n* For those who are unable to drive due to disabilities or other reasons\n* For people who want to work beyond their normal work schedule and put in extra work (aka \"Workaholics\" ;-)\n* etc.\n\nIf it's all laid out, there won't be as much animosity and confusion.

Replied to fellow alum\/stranger's facebook post calling for illustrators to do 20-40 simple illustrations for her \"side project\" app game. Now being asked what my rates are. **Should I propose flat rate or hourly pay?** I have no idea where she's coming from - a company, or just out of her basement? Pros and cons below...\n\n2. If hourly, **how are you supposed to measure\/prove logged hours on a freelance gig to a remote client,** just working out of your bedroom? And convince them it's legit, so they'll actually feel confident about paying you the right amount? Is there a free app, web tool, or program for that (must be free in case client needs to download it too)? \nPeople do this all the time, so there must be *something*?\n\n**Details**\n\nI'm an illustrator who replied in FB messenger to a post on FB seeking an illustrator to do art similar to tamagotchi creatures for a pokemon\/pet-like app game. http:\/\/41.media.tumblr.com\/70e643af1d9d9dac6af572b83cebbd6f\/tumblr_nbjdasDuw51qjs7mxo2_500.png\n\n\nShe just replied that she needs 20-40 character designs and asked me what my rate is.\n\nI'm considering offering 2 options: 1. flat rate. 2. hourly pay\n\nI've gotten screwed over by flat rate so much that I really need something better.\n\nSo I want to do hourly pay on a contract. But is it appropriate to tell her that?\n\nHourly pay for this actual position in app game development is $11-25 per hour (varies greatly on fame of company), and I would request $15-20. But... isn't this gonna be too much for such simple drawings?\n\n\nSo...\n\n**Ask for hourly rate**\n\nPros:\n\n* More accurate repayment of my time spent\n\n* Covers the \"brainstorming\/sketching\" phase (prob won't take long but who knows, maybe it goes over 1-2 hours for 40 characters)\n\n* Covers countless hours of \"fixing it\" and \"doing it over\"\n\n* Easier to write in the contract\n\n* Ethically, the right thing to ask for if she IS from a company\n\nCons:\n\n* End of the line for me. Rude if it's just her own thing - she obviously can't pay for my work, and it's a ridiculous price - lost job opportunity\n\n* I have no idea where she is. If timezones conflict, hourly \"tracking\" will be too confusing for us both - lost job\/job poorly done (trust me - worked for a chinese freelance thing once...horrible. They expected me to reply within the hour after midnight in the US, then when I didn't, called off their proposed payment and refused to pay anything. I don't even KNOW how to open a dispute with them).\n\n* Can't request deposit (can't predict how many hours I'm gonna log)\n\n\n**Ask for flat rate**\n\nPros:\n\n* She's more likely to accept this since it'll sound cheaper\n\n* Can request deposit\n\nCons:\n\n* Complicated - each character $5 (3 variations included), +$5 for overhauls and further revisions OR $20 for 20 characters, +$5 for each revision\/overhaul\n\n* Wouldn't the range 20-40 be way too ambiguous to guess an exact amount?\n\n* Doesn't pay well... it's pocket change \n\n* If priced per character, it's better pay, but she can stop asking for more characters after I draw like 2 of them. \n\n\nI've already replied, asking more questions about the visual details, if she's gonna give a contract, and if I'm doing this for a company or just her, saying I need this info to estimate an exact rate.\n\n\nBtw, yeah, she's a rando, but she does do work in-office for graphic design agencies - I just don't know if she takes this project seriously enough or understands how illustration freelance works to pay really fairly\/professionally - but I assume she's at least reasonable)\n\n\nAnd before you say it, yeah, I already have my own contract to give her if she says she doesn't have one.\n\n----------\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nSo I found out she's just a kid like me (but employed...lol) who is doing this completely by herself.\nShe's trying to learn coding, and this is just her little experiment. \nSo while I'd love $2,000+ from this, that might sound a bit weird.\n\nSeeing how you guys all said $15 was too low, I decided to use a $17 per hour rate. \n\nBTW: I am entry level. I've only done an internship like this position before.\n\nI didn't want to make it as high as an actual studio\/company would pay, because she's not a studio. She's just some entry\/mid-level-ish person.\n\n**OK, so here's what I wrote to her.**\n\nFirst, I'll let you know that I base my rates on $17 per hour.\nIf I had to put a range, it would be $15-$18.\n\nNext, 20-40 is kind of a big range, so I'll start the estimate on 20 characters.\nBased on your 3 evolutions idea, the actual amount of characters would be multiples of 3, so the exact pricing would vary based on how many groups of 3 you want.\n\nFinally, my pricing will include revision and re-do fees.\n\nHere is a draft of how it would go. I still don't know exactly how complex you want the complex characters to be, so I made 2 drafts:\n1 for 20 characters of a simple style, 1 for 20 characters of a complex style.\n\nSIMPLEST STYLE\n20 characters\n\n1) Sketch stage (I will sketch ideas out independently)\n\n3 variations per character.\n\n10 mins per variation.\n\n3 variations = 30 mins.

Technically the conferences were optional, but it would have been foolish not to go. I don't travel well and took vacation days after to recover.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"TL;DR - don't log in immediately upon waking; get up at the same time you did when you had to leave the house, use that time to shower & change, stretch & move. Prepare some food in case you get busy, and fill up your water bottle. Designate a stationary work area to set boundaries, listen to engaging background noise (podcasts, audiobooks, radio) and take your breaks!\n\n~\n\nIn the beginning, I found it really difficult to adjust to working from home all of the time. I would literally just wake up at the last second, roll out of bed and log into work. Some days, I wouldn't even get out of bed, and I would just have the laptop with me. I started getting so lazy and drained, I'd forget to eat breakfast, not shower or change for at least half of the day - forget to breathe!\n\nAfter a few months of this it started to take a toll on me and I felt quite exhausted. I realized that although I'm not a strict routine person, it was very important to incorporate a healthy and regular routine into this situation. Not only to feel fulfilled, but also to have some time to myself the way I had while getting ready for work in the morning and before leaving the house.\n\nPersonally, it took me a while to figure out the best strategy for myself. But I started to hop in the shower as soon as I woke up. I set up a designated space for my work. I was lucky to have this, but even if you're lacking space it's important to have some sort of a boundary. I also found that it increased my productivity, because I made this a stationary setup where I was no longer able to bring my laptop with me elsewhere (I could, but effort) as I had it hooked up to a keyboard, mouse, and dual monitors. This, for me, was the most important step in my process of creating a healthy work from home environment.\n\nSo, after my shower I would then turn my computer on and let the remote desktop load up while I made coffee, prepared some breakfast for later (as I don't usually eat straight away, but it would help me to not get so busy I'd forget to eat)  I would also fill up my water bottle because I also noticed i had a serious lack of water intake, especially compared to when I was in the office, because going for water stops with my colleagues was a way to get away, have a break from the desk, stretch & move.\n\nI also thought it was helpful in the morning to get outside and go for a walk anywhere, for about 10 minutes, even if it was just to grab a coffee or pick something up from the store or pharmacy, check the mail - whatever. Because walking was a very normal part of my daily routine beforehand, getting about 8,000 steps a day on foot commute alone! Also, this lack of movement and exercise was starting to become apparent\n\nUsually during the day now I like to put on podcasts, or some kind of background noise - talk radio, audiobooks, or music. Something that is easy listening, interesting at times, and keeps my brain engaged. While this may not work for everyone and could be distracting, I'm coming from a quite social and vibrant office and noticed that while at home I was spending more time on my phone throughout the working day than I would have at the office. Having something else to listen to or distract me from being at home, helped keep me accountable and focus on work.\n\nWell, this turned is a novel LOL but I just wanted to share my complete experience! It can be hard, but keep trying it out and you'll figure out the best steps for you.\n\nAnd most of all, remember to keep your head up!","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"I am about to house sit in the UK (N Ireland and Scotland) and I will also be working remotely (PT contract work) \n\n\nI will be traveling for just over 2 months (so less than 75 days), I am from the US.\n\n\nI currently do not have a return ticket back into the US.

The problem is it's growing too fast for me to manage alone. I want a handful of people I can teach and hand the ropes over too.\n\n\nMy challenge is I have a busy and erratic work schedule so a team of remote staff works better for me.\n\n\n**TL;DR of below**\n\nA salary starting at $260USD for 20 hours work a week. In your free time you can have another job, travel or create and grow your own businesses \/ websites with our support and network.\n\n\nMy goals are;\n\n**- Little risk for employees**\n\nI've worked in the digital marketing industry for 10+ years across small and big agencies. I want to work with driven people that are good at process and management. You will need to learn the skills and the tools to get up to speed with how the company works. I will therefore provide you with paid on the job training.\n\n\n**- Unlimited income opportunity**\n\nI want to give employees the opportunity to establish passive income without putting an upper limit on how much success they can have. I'll show you how this all works and then in your spare time if you want to work on your own projects you can go for it.\n\n\n**- Pass on knowledge**\n\nCreating a successful digital marketing campaign takes a lot more than simply putting ads on Facebook. I want the apprentices to actually participate and get an understanding of what makes a digital marketing campaign successful & the ongoing optimization involved.\n\n\n**- To grow the business further**\n\nI want to grow the business further and share the success with the team. It's becoming almost impossible for me to grow at the moment due to the volume of work I'm trying to juggle.\n\n\n\nThe program details\n\n\n**- Salary**\n\nFor this is an apprentice role we will pay you a starting salary of $260 USD for 20 hrs a week. However, this contract is negotiable with every renewal so salary will not be limited to this.\n\n\n**- 3 month Apprenticeship**\n\nLong term stability is important but we are also just starting out. So, the apprentice program runs for 3 months, after which it can be extended each 6 month period. \n\n\n**- Interviews**\n\nWe'll have a couple of Skype calls initially.\nIf successful in the Skype interview (more like a chat really), before committing to a 3 month contract we'll work through some small tasks together and yes, you will be paid for this time. Providing we're both happy we'll work on a 3 month contract initially and then extend to 6.\n\n\n**- 20 hours a week**\n\nIdeally I don't really want to work more than that so really can't expect you to. However, we're flexible. After the 3 month contract let's talk about the hours you want and we can see if we can make it work.\n\n\n**- What will you be doing**\n\nAs a new business my processes and management are still being ironed out. I would love to work with someone that wants to help with that.\n\n\nThe bulk of my work involves;\n\n* Writing lengthy digital marketing strategies for clients\n\n* Coding some basic HTML & Javascript\n\n* Setting up Facebook, Youtube, Google AdWords advertising campaigns\n\n* Ongoing account management\/optimizations\n\n* Writing Lengthy blog posts\n\n* Making short videos and ads\n\n* Pulling digital marketing performance data and writing monthly reports\n\n* Emailing and phoning clients to make sure they are happy\n\n\nWhy Should You Join\n\n**- We'll provide training**\n\nperfect if you want a role in digital marketing but have no experience.\n- You have the freedom to work from anywhere in the world.\n\n\n**- Flexible working hours**\n\nSplit out the 20 hrs a week to whatever suits your lifestyle.\n\n\n**- Get Paid**\n\nPromptly paid bi-weekly.\n\n\n**- Future Potential**\n\nWe don't believe in restrictions for achieving any career goal you have. In fact we'd like to help you achieve them whether that be building websites and apps or becoming a successful blogger.\n\n\n**- Freedom**\n\nYou can work from anywhere in the world. We do not have a permanent office from where you can work, so you are free to work from pretty much anywhere.\n\n\n\nAbout you\n\n\n**- Who would this job suit?**\n\n\nPerhaps you're traveling, retired or want a career change.\nIt's important that you are self motivating and able to take a project from idea to execution pretty much on your own. We want problem solvers.\n\n\nWe don't expect you to have all the required skills but we want you to work on the projects you find fun. It's hard to motivate yourself if you don't enjoy the work.\n\n\nOur work can be fairly technical and data driven. If you have an interest in coding, we could get you setting up reports debugging Google Analytics or setting up Wordpress sites.\n\n\nAlternatively you might be a keen writer. We have lots of marketing strategies we have to write, big 4000 word blog posts and other smaller written projects.\n\n\nAnd there's always room for creative people. If you like making your own videos, photography or have an eye for design this could be the job for you.\n\n\n\n**What Should You Do Next**\n\n\nIf your interested or know someone that might be drop me a private message.\n\n\nI would like to know a little about you.\nWhy you would like to be part of this.\nWhat you're working on at the moment.\nFeel free to be creative, interesting, pro active.\n\n\nWe'll exchange and email or two and then hop on skype to talk about how it works.\n\n\n==========\n\n\n**EDIT:**  I just want to quickly thank everyone that has got in contact so far.

It's kind of the opposite: they aren't policing her because of them viewing you as a crutch. They are just ignoring the reality of your existence as a legit reason to do anything for your wife.\n\nBut beyond that, taking into accord your medical\/disability situation does not fall on the company **under the ADA**.\n\nNow if you're in California, taking your disability into account under their FEHA (\"Fair Employment and Housing Act \") *would* be an entirely different matter.

And I am expecting on Monday to have another mostly leisure day. \n\nIt's all about getting your work done. And if you can do that, you won't be micromanaged. And then you won't have a schedule. \n\nI was one of the few remote workers for my BigCompany before the pandemic because they trusted me and my work output. Before that when I had to go into the office, I am not a 9-5 type person. I'm more of a noon start to middle of the night person. I did the 9am start for about 4 months when I was brand new. Showed my work ethic and my output. From then I just started coming in later and later until it became my schedule. Blocked out my calendar for mornings. Everyone knew I would be there after lunch physically. But emails or texts anytime if an emergency. If we had a corporate type meeting all day, I was there at 8am or whatever was needed. I was flexible when needed, they were flexible when it wasn't important. \n\nFor the past few years I haven't taken a day of \"vacation\" because I am able to plan my days and weeks and months around flights and leisure which include multi-day trips to different countries. Or a week off to work on personal projects. Or a week to stay with family with only 3 virtual meetings. \n\nIt can be done.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"Not trying to be rude but I gathered the position was hybrid from your first paragraph. . .

I wanted to share some of my unconventional tips with you on how to land a remote job. These are the things I did to land two part-time remote positions in content marketing & SEO (both separate companies) only 2 weeks after I spontaneously called it quits at my office job. Getting hired for a remote position is harder than getting hired for an office job. The applicant pool is typically much, much higher since you're competing with everyone in the world, not just in your geographical region. These are the things I did to stand out from the crowd and land an interview with the remote-based companies (and ultimately, got myself hired).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step One: Get Trained in a Job That Can Be Done Remotely**\n\nThe list for jobs that can be done remotely is huge and chances are you already have experience in one of them. The most common remote jobs that I've seen are things like marketing, design, web development, admin, project management, sales and customer support.\n\nIf you already have a lot of experience in any of these areas, then you're one step ahead! But if you don't and you're trying to transition into a role that can be done remotely then you need to start now with training.\n\nThere are many online courses that will help you get started in learning these skills. Search on Google for the best online courses in your industry of choice and start learning!\n\nIf you don't have any formal experience or something to put on your resume then keep on reading because in step #3 I'll tell you how to get past this obstacle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step Two: Find Available Remote Jobs**\n\nYou can start by asking your current boss if you can transfer to a remote role. Tim Ferris gives a great step by step guide on how to do this in his book The 4 Hour Workweek. If you're interested in a video about this, let me know in the comments!\n\nIf you're boss said no or you're wanting to make the leap into a new position altogether, it's time to start searching.\n\nWe still live in a time where the majority of jobs listed online are location-based so searching on any regular job board will be a huge time waster.\n\nThere are some excellent job boards dedicated to remote working such as Remote.co and WorkingNomads and you should be looking on these.  The only catch? Most of these jobs, despite being remote, are still US-based. As a Canadian, I found it hard to find jobs I would qualify for. But if you are American, you're in luck! Set up email alerts with all of these sites so you'll be notified of new listings. And you can do this no matter where you're based out of anyway as some jobs that are posted are open to non-Americans.\n\nIf you're wondering where I found my most recent remote jobs, I used Indeed and I filtered for Work from Home jobs. While Indeed is a general job board, they had an easy option to only include remote options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step Three: Create Your Own Side Project**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA side project is *amazing* for proving your skill, your passion and your ability to manage yourself without someone looking over your shoulder.\n\nNow this tip is very powerful and I have had all of my bosses, past and present, remote or not, tell me this is the reason why they chose me for the position over the hundreds of applicants that applied.\n\nI started my own side project called [Publicifi](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/publicifi), which is a video series aimed at helping DIY musicians learn how to do their own marketing. I now have another video series just launched called [The Couch Commuter](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC-3NG3By0iHW0za0KZjy2pA) that's aimed at helping remote workers.\n\nI built something up from scratch and it demonstrated my initiative, my marketing skills and my genuine passion for the industry.\n\nNow remember in step #1 when I said I have the tip for you that will help you so much if you don't have any previous experience to put on your resume? This is it.\n\nUse your new-found knowledge from your online training and build something on your own and then shout about it to hiring managers and in your resume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step Four: Stand Out From the Crowd with Unique Application Bonuses**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's another personal secret of mine that has landed me jobs in the past where there were huge pools of applicants. I went above and beyond what was asked for in the job application with little added touches.\n\nThese are things no one else would think of doing or wouldn't have the guts to do. You might be wondering, what are these magical touches that are so powerful?\n\nWell, here's just a few that I have done that you can try but the key here is to be creative and think of your own unique magical touches.\n\nIn the past I have:\n\n* Made a personalized video for the company basically acting as my cover letter\n* I have sent postcards in the mail to show off where I'm currently living and why working remotely is so amazing to me\n* I have created a personalized business plan for a company on what I plan to do for the first 90 days after getting hired.\n\nI had people tell me it was weird and way too forward but hey, it's how I landed myself a remote job only 2 weeks after leaving my office job.\n\nPut a little bit of time into personalizing your applications and earn those extra brownie points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step Five: Follow Up**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this applies to any job you apply for, remote or not, but it's very important. When I was job hunting I was tracking all of the applications I was sending out in a Google spreadsheet and then I would follow up with any company who did not respond after one week. I ended up getting quite a few responses from just following up!\n\nDon't be too pushy, just let them know you're still interested and leave it at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step Six: Nail Your Skype Interview**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, we've reached the final tip and this one is for when you have landed an interview for a remote job and you have just one more step to go before you officially work from home.\n\ni'm going to give you my best advice that I've learned to help you with your Skype interview.\n\nSkype interviews can be weird but I personally love them over in person interview. I get really nervous in interviews but I feel way more chilled out in the comfort of my own home.\n\nMy first piece of advice for you is to have some sneaky notes nearby of what you want to mention or some bullet Points on how you want to answer common interview questions like your strengths and weaknesses. The perks of a video interview is that they can't tell if you're glancing down at a note for a refresher on what you want to say.\n\nMy second tip is to dress professionally and put in the effort to have good lighting and a good environment. Just because you're at home doesn't mean their first impression of you should be in a dark and loud room with your PJ's on and your bed head all a mess.\n\nAnd then treat the interview as you would any in person one. Be confident or at least act the part, ask thoughtful questions and bring up lots of examples of your amazing achievements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you found this guide helpful! Have you done anything out of the box or unconventional to land a job in the past?  I want to hear about it. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"Hi!\n\nAs many people now, I lost my income due to the corona crisis.

Daily \/ hourly ranking updates, tracking certain products' ranking in certain categories, things like that.\n- Scrapers that pull in data from a CRM, then goes out to the web to find social media statistics (accounts associated with a certain domain + followers\/fans and so on) about each company in the CRM\n\n**My Work Stack**\n\nI build my scarpers in NodeJS. It's incredibly fast and lightweight, and after doing this for nearly 5 years I'm quite good at squeezing out as much power from a NodeJS server as I can. I generally scrape data using Cheerio and Request, but am also comfortable using PhantomJS or Casper for more intricate requirements (parsing pages rendered by Javascript, logging in to certain sites, things like that).\n\nI can also build you a beautiful front-end to view, edit and work with the data being retrieved, I can export it to CSVs, I can set up a server to email you a CSV of the data once and hour if you really want! \n\n**How I work**\n\nI live between New York, Melbourne, Bangkok and Osaka. Right now I'm in New York, but will be heading back to Australia for a few months in mid February. Other details:\n\n* My rate is US$60\/hr\n* I can host your scraper on my VPS for a fee, I can also ship to you via [Docker](http:\/\/docker.com)\n* I'm on Slack and email during all reasonable working hours and only take on one project at a time, so you've got my full attention while we're working together\n* More than happy to send you sample briefs for you to figure out exactly what you need.\n\nPM me here for more information, preferably with some details about your project. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"about the same level of skill as using microsoft word.

My situation is slightly different (thanks to the advent of remote work, I have a client who resides and operates his business in NY, my legal residence is in Colorado, but I'm physically outside the country).  There is no online filing system for NY to make a claim.  I have started to look for lawyers in NY who manage contracts and collections, but have been quoted astronomical fees.  To boot, this is not a standard invoice, but a breach of contract penalty sent on as a final invoice.  Client admitted to breaching contract in writing, and ask that the penalties be assessed.  Now he won't pay.  I've broken down in multiple explanations how I arrived at the penalty amount, and it's quite fair considering what I could do to him if this went to court.\n\nWhat are some best practices you've found if filing in court is nearly impossible (OR, can you suggest a way to get this filed on my behalf in NY, I've never had to file a claim against someone in another part of the world)?  I'm sending on a \"reminder\" invoice with a late fee tacked on to show this isn't going to go away.

Some of the more aggressive back-to-office policies and stances company leaders are implementing are frustrating to employees. \n\n# What to Do If You Want to Stay Remote\n\nMaybe your first thought is to hit up the [remote job boards](https:\/\/remoteworkjunkie.com\/best-remote-job-boards\/) and start looking for your new opportunity. While that may be an option, you don't have to give up on your current company quite yet! \n\nIf you are extremely passionate about remote work and you really do like your employer, you may have options yet to convince management and HR to stay remote. \n\n**1. Understand the policies and current stance on remote work**\n\nBefore you talk to managers or HR, you should have a complete understanding of their return to office policy. By being educated and prepared, you won't be caught off guard if questions come at you. And it shows that you genuinely have a plan when it comes to wanting to work from home. \n\nIf you work for a large organization, you may see executives' views on remote work out in public. Read those articles and quotes to understand how leadership views work today. \n\n**2. Write down your accomplishments while being remote**\n\nDuring the time you worked remotely, what accomplishments did you achieve? You want to show you can do great work without being in the office. \n\nBeyond the wins you had, how do you plan to continue being productive going forward? A concern from the company might be that long-term remote work will not be sustainable. However, show what steps, technologies, and processes you use to ensure there are no gaps in your work or among the team you work with. \n\n**3. The benefits to you, the team, and the company**\n\nAlthough your managers or HR leader may understand these points, it's good to have these ready to share.\n\nHow does working remotely benefit you professionally and personally? You want to show how it makes you better in multiple ways and how that will impact your work, the team, and the company overall. \n\n**4. Keep \"remote work\" out of your meeting request**\n\nWhen you reach out to your manager and\/or HR about wanting to work from home, I'd recommend not including that in the note.\n\nInstead, position it as a conversation about your job role and how the job is done. And naturally, during your discussion, you can bring up working remotely with your overall prepared plan and thoughts. \n\n**5. Connect face-to-face (Video or in-person)**\n\nWith a request about your work situation, it should be In-person or over video. Do not do this through an email or text. It's definitely okay to send an email recap after on what was discussed.\n\nA more face-to-face approach shows respect and confidence, plus it ensures you are being heard and can have a good discussion about remote work.\n\n**6. Be open to some work flexibility** \n\nIf you are flexible and feel there is pushback to working full-time from home, then provide some additional options. Here are two things you can suggest to get in the right direction:\n\n* Ask for an extended remote work trial. This can prove how you will still contribute in a meaningful way to the company and team remotely. You might only get a few weeks out of this, but you can come back with even more positive results. \n* No hybrid schedule? Ask to be remote a few days a week first to show that it will work and to ease into your desire to be remotely every day of the week. You can aim for three days a week being remote, but also be agreeable to two days if there is pushback.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nNow if the above does not work and you really want to work remotely, then it is probably time to start applying elsewhere. \n\nIt is also possible that your manager or HR leaders need to get back to you. But don't let it linger too long. That might be a way to see how serious you are or to completely ignore the request and hope you give in. \n\nAgain, you should have managers and HR who respect your opinions and time, even if they deny or disagree. If that's not the case, that's a big red flag and it's time to move on. \n\nSwitching employers, especially if you really enjoy your current work, is not always an easy choice. But you need to look out for your best interests and work how you want.\n\n*More remote work tips, guides, and remote jobs* [*here*](https:\/\/remoteworkjunkie.com\/)*.*","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":" \n\nAre you being asked to work at home during this time?

What will likely matter more for a DN is the culture of the company and team.... and perhaps most importantly your manger.\n\nThat being said... What employers think about remote work has changed in the last year of course, but in the past you could have made an argument that the more in demand a skill was, the more likely you'd be able to do it remote. Simply because the employer may struggle to find a candidate locally. I think that's probably sound advice in general: pick skills that companies compete over.\n\nAnecdotally I might also suggest trying to avoid roles where on-call duty is required or you have to constantly be monitoring something.

The path to becoming a CEO isn't generally paved with work\/life balance and rejecting hustle culture. Of course, it's a trick to try to motivate everyone to buy in to hustle culture this way, because how many people who buy in would be CEOs anyway? Hardly any. \n\nIf you're a founder, most people understand there's no work\/life balance. Heck, even give people real stake in a company that is meaningful and they'll have a logical reason to hustle in some cases.

Most CEOS already work where they please and did long before Covid (aside from need to meet with investors etc).

Love having the flex time to take care of my body!!","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"Working from home has its perks, no doubt. No commute, flexible hours, and the freedom to work in your PJs. But let's face it, it can also get pretty lonely. The lack of face-to-face interaction can sometimes make us feel isolated. So, how do we combat this loneliness? Here are some tried-and-true strategies:\n\n**1. Daily 20-Minute Team Meetings**\n\nStart your day with a quick 20-minute team meeting. This isn't for discussing work-related issues, but rather a chance to share what you're planning to do for the day, any interesting news, or even what you had for breakfast! It's a great way to maintain a sense of camaraderie and keep the team spirit alive.\n\n**2. Connect with Peers**\n\nFind a couple of people in similar roles and set up monthly meetings with them. This can be a great way to share experiences, discuss challenges, and learn from each other. Plus, it's always nice to connect with people who \"get\" what you're going through.\n\n**3. Get a Coach**\n\nConsider getting a coach to help you navigate the challenges of remote work. A coach can provide guidance, support, and a listening ear when things get tough. Apps like **wave.ai** offer coaching services tailored to your needs. They can also help you with things like salary negotiation or career crossovers.\n\n**4. Weekly Game Session**\n\nOrganize a weekly 30-minute game session with your team. This could be anything from online games like **Garticphone** or **Kahoot**, to virtual yoga sessions, or even a cooking challenge. It's a fun way to break the monotony and foster team bonding.\n\n**5. Create a Cozy Workspace**\n\nMake your workspace a place you love. Add some plants, pictures, or anything that makes you happy. A cozy workspace can make your workday more enjoyable and less lonely.\n\n**6. Take Regular Breaks**\n\nDon't forget to take regular breaks. Step away from your desk, make a cup of tea, or take a short walk. It's important for your mental health and can make your workday feel less isolating.\n\n**7. Stay Active **\n\nExercise is a great mood booster. Try to incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine. It could be a morning jog, a midday yoga session, or an evening dance party in your living room!\n\nIt's normal to feel lonely when working remotely. But with these strategies, you can combat the loneliness and make your work-from-home experience a positive one.\n\nAny other tips you follow?","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"I work remotely for QVC network and we are always hiring for CSRs!

New backend code is expected to be written in Go, include automated tests run by TeamCity, and go through internal code review on GitHub Enterprise.

There have been a lot of ups and downs, but overall I'm really enjoying the flexibility and freedom that comes with it.

I can take breaks when I need to, and I can work around other commitments.

The boundaries between your personal life and your work life become blurred, and it can be difficult to relax and unwind.

That said, my company despite this is only letting me be there for 2 months at my current pay (if I stayed longer, I would need to give up most of my salary to say because of the exchange rate). \n\nWhile this is very annoying, I assume this is probably the case for most companies. But it did make me think about it and wonder if I were to go to some other remote company, and pitched them the same thing what would happen. My inclination is that if they have no liability, it isn't preventing me from getting work done, attending meetings, and generally doing my job, then why wouldn't they let me do this? What would be the reason if the nomad visa eliminated them of any liability? Outside of just not wanting to give employees an extra benefit without getting some kind of concession, if the person was a good performer then I'm not sure why they wouldn't. \n\nThat said, I assume it isn't that easy, and so I'd be curious to hear everyone's experiences with this, and if they've been able to convince their companies to let them do this.","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"[RemoteCyberJobs.com](https:\/\/RemoteCyberJobs.com) aims to be the go-to resource for discovering awesome remote jobs in Cyber Security around the globe.\n\nThe idea is to provide an ultra-focused, fast and lean job site with a super-simple job email service.

Most of our customers are healthcare business owners. We love to be able to support them with the business, management, and technology sides of running their business. Primarily we do this with our software, Cliniko, but that's only a part, we want to do more. We want to gather, simplify, and share information with them that can help. The internet is a busy and unreliable place, we want our online material to be a place our customers can come for quality.\n\n# What is Cliniko?\n\n[Cliniko](https:\/\/www.cliniko.com\/) is practice management software that makes life easy for allied health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, running video consultations, and much more. The software is used globally by tens of thousands of practitioners every day.\n\nBehind Cliniko is a team of 42 people, spread around the world. We work completely remotely, although our base is in Melbourne, Australia. We care more about finding the best person for the job than looking for someone that lives nearby.\n\nWe don't have managers, we rarely have meetings, and there are no time sheets to complete. We're responsible, autonomous, creative, and proactive in doing our best for our customers. We're focused on making great software and we take pride in doing good work. It's important to us that [we have a positive impact on the world](https:\/\/www.cliniko.com\/blog\/news\/cliniko-has-donated-1-million-to-charity\/).\n\nIf you want to know more about how we work, our founder, Joel, [gave a talk about it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU).\n\n# What you'll work on\n\nYou will spend your time writing or editing things for Cliniko. Taking a rough idea or a vague concept and developing it into a final piece is the norm. This can include things like:\n\n* Blog posts.\n* Social media posts.\n* Website copy.\n* Community forum posts.\n* New feature announcements.\n* Scripts for videos.\n* Wording within the Cliniko application.\n* Researching topics for content.\n* Anything else you think needs doing.\n\nYou'll help us continue to communicate in a friendly, honest, and sometimes humorous way.\n\n# Requirements\n\nYou are someone who loves to write, and people enjoy reading what you've written. It's friendly, humorous, and easy to understand. You have a way with words that's engaging and joyful. You can take a complex topic, and make it clear and easy to understand.\n\nIt matters to you that when someone reads your writing, they are better off for it. That might mean they learned something, had an emotional response, or even just enjoyed themselves. There is a purpose to your content.\n\nYou have superb English skills (both verbal and written). You are able to take your thoughts, or subject matter that you've researched, and put them together in an easy to understand way. You're able to convey your content in an enticing, accurate, and jargon-free way.\n\nDoing research before you write a piece is an enjoyable part of the process. You want to make sure you really understand a topic before you put together your piece. You are comfortable learning about and creating content for new topics, because of the strength of your research.\n\nNo matter what your background is, or how you identify, if you feel you meet the requirements, we encourage you to apply. We know that having a diverse team is necessary to have different perspectives, and it's how we'll continue to find new ways to make Cliniko better. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity which is crucial to how we work.\n\n# Benefits\n\nHere are some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:\n\n* 30-hour work week, full-time pay.\n* Flexible hours, choose when you work.\n* Work from anywhere.\n* Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).\n* Supplied computer equipment.\n* Ergonomic furniture.\n* Fresh organic fruit delivered weekly to your home.\n* Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for, too).\n* No managers.\n* No meetings.\n\n# Salary\n\nWe generally pay quite well for our positions. The **minimum** we would pay for this position would be $80,000 AUD. That is just a starting point though, and we would encourage you to apply regardless of your salary expectations.\n\n# How to apply\n\nPlease use the \"Tell us about yourself\" field on the application page to give us enough information to be interested in taking you to the next stage. This doesn't mean you need to go over the top though - we'll have a lot of applications, so a focus on clarity and quality is appreciated. Oh, and please be yourself, there's no need for formality.\n\nThere's also a field to link to work that you've done that you're proud of. You can reference one or more pieces of content that showcase your ability well.\n\nLastly, we'd love you to write a tweet for us. We want to announce that unlike certain others in the news lately, we will NOT be working on a self-indulgent space mission. This is a satirical tweet, and not one that we'll actually use. Although we'd like to :)\n\nJob applications close **7th of October, 2021.**\n\n# What you can expect after applying\n\nOnce you've applied, sit back and relax while we get to work on our side! We'll only begin reviewing applications on 8th October, 2021, after applications have closed. In recent hiring, we've had hundreds of applications, so it can take us some time to review them all. We will individually review every application.\n\nYou can expect to hear back from us by 22nd October, 2021 at the latest. Every application will get a response, whether successful or not. If you haven't heard from us by then, please do let us know.\n\nAt this point, we'll be down to around 50 applications that are still in the running, so you can see why the initial application matters. Our founder, Joel, will then have a 5-minute video call with all these applicants to determine who will continue to the test stage. This round should take approximately 1 week to complete depending on the number of applicants still remaining.\n\nWe will then narrow to a much smaller pool of remaining applicants, and there'll be a mock writing task to complete. We expect this task will take no more than 6 hours to complete, so please make sure you're prepared to spend that time before applying. To partly compensate for the time you would spend on this, we'll pay $250 AUD to each person who submits the task\n\nFrom the tasks, we will select just a few to have short video chats with a number of people from our team to help us make the final choice. You'll likely chat to people from a range of roles at Cliniko (support, developers, etc.).\n\nFinally the exciting part for us, and hopefully also for the chosen person. We'll hire them to join our team! That will happen fast, and the start date will be chosen by the applicant.\n\nWe know it's quite a process to go through, so we want to make sure you know what you're in for up front. It's important that you can make an informed decision to participate or not. We'll be transparent with everyone along the way.\n\nOne final note, unfortunately due to the quantity of applications we receive, we are not able to provide feedback for those not successful in the first round. In the later stages, we'll do our best to provide what we can, if requested.\n\nGood luck! \n\nTo apply, head to: [https:\/\/apply.workable.com\/cliniko\/j\/4CBB89060F\/](https:\/\/apply.workable.com\/cliniko\/j\/4CBB89060F\/)\n\nBe sure to follow the instructions carefully when applying!

I was already feeling overwhelmed from lack of any training of any kind and that I needed to ask so many questions. The straw that broke the camel's back was right at the beginning of my shift when one of the managers I had never met or heard of located me on the salesfloor, and began to unprofessionally scream commands at me, out of nowhere, while I was 10min into my shift and already doing the task that *my* direct manager had asked me to do while I was clocking in.

I am looking for someone who can get prospects, warm them up, and if possible, close them without me having to use up too much of my time. However, I can handle the final closing call if need be. \n\n**About Us** \n\nI've developed a marketing\/sales system for a very specific niche within the legal services niche. Our results have been highly successful, and this system can be easily replicated across various locations. \n\nFor example, one of our largest clients is in Arizona right now. We do not take on any competing clients in Arizona. However, we could use almost the exact same system in California, Texas, New York, etc. - the problem is just that we need to get new clients in these location. \n\nI personally live abroad outside of the United States in Asia, which is why handling sales calls and sales work for me is highly inconvenient. I also prefer to be the one working on improving the marketing, ads, etc. on the back-end, not closing clients and handling the service side. \n\nThe reason I need to hire a niche sales rep is because while I am great at running ads there are only a handful of businesses within this niche that my system works for. Thus running ads would not be the best sales method. \n\nIn order to make your job easy I can provide documents\/graphs proving the success of our marketing system in this niche that you can use to close clients. \n\n**Your Tasks \/ The Job** \n\nI am open to proposals and new ideas for ways we can close clients. I am looking for someone largely independent and that can handle the bulk of sales work themselves. Closing clients via cold outreach is honestly not my area of expertise, so if you have suggestions, I can listen. \n\nYour job would involve cold outreach (ie. LinkedIN, Email, calling), warming prospects up, and then closing them. I can hop on a final closing call if need be. \n\nWhat I am looking for is a closer who can get people closed or highly warmed up for my call. You need to be able to identify businesses that could use our system, contact them, present our services, and close them. \n\nNote that this is the legal services niche, so I am NOT looking for someone that is all hype and excitement. Our client calls are typically boring and quite logical, simply explaining how the numbers work and lead to profit for everyone. \n\n**Pay** \n\nI can pay a base rate (monthly salary or hourly) as well as a very generous commission. The base or monthly rate is up for negotiation, but will honestly be rather low to start, unless you can clearly illustrate to me your value and guarantee your success. \n\nAs for commission, our clients typically pay us around $1,500-$3,000 per week. I am willing to give up to 50% commission lifetime on the client. If our client is paying us $1,500 a week, then you'll make $750 per week for as long as we keep the client. \n\nCommission will be paid out within 7 days of a payment being received. You will have viewing access to payment records and ad accounts so that you can personally verify you are being paid your fair share. \n\n**More Info About Our Clients & Goals** \n\nOur clients typically spend $1,000-$3,000 USD per DAY on ads through our system. We use Google Ads, Bing Ads, Facebook Ads, Display Network Ads, Email marketing, webinars, landing pages, and other online tools for marketing in order to get sales for our clients. \n\nWe take a percentage of adspend from clients, incentivizing us to get more results for our clients within their key performance indicators. \n\nI refuse to take more than one client per city\/area because I do not want my clients competing with my system. Once a client is closed in an area, we move onto another area. \n\nRight now I'd like to focus on targeting American clients, though I am open to other countries in the future. \n\nBeing that we run online ads as part of the system for our clients, we can only take on clients in certain cities or areas that have a large enough population for these types of ads. \n\nFor example, it would be unlikely that we take on a client in the State of Wyoming or Montana because both states have a very small population and are unlikely to worth it for us to take on a client in that area. \n\nOur system works anywhere, but in the example of a client in Wyoming we might only be able to spend a few hundred per day in ads for the client, thus our company would make significantly less money. \n\nIt is for this reason that we are focusing on key areas such as Texas, New York, Florida, etc.- Once hired, I can provide a list of regions that I would like clients closed in. \n\nPart of your job will involve screening of these prospects to make sure that they are large enough for us to take on. Our marketing system performs best when clients can spend around $1k-$5k per day on ads. \n\nOnce you've closed all the clients that you can, I don't expect you to work anymore on sales. You can help with retaining the clients via Email and phone communication. Again, this is a very specific sub-niche of legal services that my company focuses on, so there is a limit to how much we can make. \n\n**More Details About Hiring** \n\nI don't care where you are in the world, as long as you can be available for calls with clients inside America. I also don't care whether English is your second, third, or even fourth language, as long as your written and spoken English does not indicate that you are extremely foreign, thus turning off prospects. A small accent is okay. \n\nIF you have a strong accent but are highly confident in your ability to get warm prospects for me to close (ie. via other communications), feel free to still apply. \n\nThis is remote and I don't expect you to be anywhere specific or be available at very specific times. I don't care where you are or what you do, as long as prospects get closed. \n\n**Applying** \n\nTo apply, please complete the application here: https:\/\/forms.gle\/GZdDEgVhS4stLGmM8\n\nI expect this position to take 1-2 weeks to fill. I am open to hiring more than one candidate if 2 or more are highly qualified. \n\nUpon completing the application, it may take me a few days to get back to you via a Reddit PM or Email. From there I will schedule a call with you where we can get to know each other and I will share more details about my company. We will then do a paid test, and if things work out, hopefully we can work together long-term. \n\nPlease only complete the application. Messaging me here on Reddit, finding my Email, or otherwise contacting me before I reach out to you will result in immediate termination of your application. \n\nOf course if you have any questions, please leave a comment so that I can answer publicly for everyone else to see. Spamming me will result in immediate termination. Also, excessive emotional commentary in an attempt to garner sympathy to secure the job will result in immediate termination of your application (ie. need the $ or else this very bad thing will happen, etc...). Please appeal to logic when applying. \n\n**About Working With Me**\n\nI don't want to waste your time with unnecessary \"meetings,\" phone calls, \"updates,\" and other time-wasters. You deliver results, I am happy. From there I don't care how you spend your time, where you are in the world, etc. Just put the results on the table and then we all make money together. I've got the marketing system that works, you just need to get a few more clients that we can duplicate this system to. \n\nIf you have any questions, please leave a comment. \n\nThanks, -Michael","Sentiment":"Positive","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"This feels a bit gatekeepy.

Its already happening in smaller cities (80-120K), they are going from inventory lags of 3-4 mo, with rental vacancy rates in the 2-5% to inventory rates of 2 weeks or less, and rental vacancy rates under 1%.  And that is driving up both rental and housing costs.  In my own area- already a booming area for remote workers, 25% of the city works remote BEFORE COVID), housing has increased more than 10% in less than 6 months.  That is more than double the normal rate. \n\nBut those remote workers LIVE here- we pay taxes here.  Getting your resident country changed for tax purposes is not that easy for individuals.  And the assumption that everyone remote can or will nomad I think is overblown- many have families and kids.  Owning a home in most countries is seen as a solid way to plan for retirement- so it is likely they will own a home SOMEWHERE, even if they nomad a bit.  \n\nAs for wage issues- PERHAPS it will drive wages down- but it certainly has not in my industry.

The company culture and attitude has to change to put remote works first, rather than as an add-on. The company I work for (massive govt consulting company) originally wasn't a WFH company. We're diverse and spread out (office everywhere) that remote was possible, but at the time it was an add-on. The preference was thast you work out of what ever nearest office there was to your location.  We did have some people remote, and even some of our sub-contractors were remote, but at the end of the day we were a in-office company. Then COVID happened... the writing was on the wall, and so it was announced that were were going to try one day to have everyone work from home to test the infrastructure.  It got scheduled for a Friday .... Thursday we packed up, took what we needed home .... and that's the last time we were officially in the office. Over the weekend, things shut down. The offices opened up one day so we could retrieve any items left behind, and then that was it. Eventually there was talk about RTO and what that would mean post-COVID. It was pretty much guaranteed to be a hybrid situation, it was a matter of what the combination would be .... then two things happened.... 1) the numbers started coming in. People were happier. Productivity shot up over 30% in the first six months... and stayed there. The reasons why were obvious - people weren't spending two hours commuting to work, getting all pissy and being grumpy. Needless interruptions topped. 2) The kicker though was the CEO woke up one morning and thought to himself that he really didn't feel like working in the office any more. That was the turning point. RTO talk stopped, and the directive came down \"make this work\" ... My team is spread out all over the place. SC, NY, Va, TN, UT, CO ...hell there's one guy on another team who doesn't have a perm address anymore, just a PO box somewhere... he's leading the nomadic life. Last I heard he was in Idaho.

It really isn't about the bosses wanting to see people, there are a lot of intangibles that you miss when remote. We have a young team and training is much easier in person than it is remote.\n\nWhen you don't have your earphones in, there are often a lot of hallway conversations. I have jumped into conversations many times over the years when I had helpful answers. It is also useful to just hear what people are discussing. You learn to tune it out when you need to get work done and it just becomes background noise like your music.\n\nI also like being able to just slide over to another person's desk and work with them. All of this is lost when one or both people are remote. I feel that the interruptions are outweighed by the benefits of collaboration.\n\nHowever, many people who do go into the office wear earphones all day so they are not interrupted as often. They like the silence or music and find that they are more productive that way. If you are going to do that all day, there is very little advantage of being in the office because you are still not participating in conversations.\n\nI now work from home 4 days a week and I often miss going to the office. We have \"collaboration Wednesdays\" where the office buys food so many people go in. There isn't a whole lot of advantage of going in more than that because so few people are there to talk to and I can do my job just as well from home. Many people moved and are permanent remote.

I am turning 40 this year, and really want to get into something that isn't geography dependent and has more room for growth and a salary. Running a business is nice for all the normal reasons, but it's also got its fair share of issues; and I promised myself during the pandemic that I'd get away from it by age 45. The goal is more financial security, a more stable schedule and the ability to be a single-income household.

During the pandemic I studied UX\/UI design heavily (a couple dozen Udemy and Lynda courses, etc.), but that seems like a dead-end in 2023. I'm also familiar with HTML, CSS, some JS and Python. Here is my new planned route:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-CompTIA A+ certification --> work a tech support job for a year or more to make extra income while working on more certifications and gain experience. (year 0.5-1)\n\n\\-CompTIA Networking+ & Security+ certifications --> Begin looking for more advanced positions with more networking and security based experience. (year 2)\n\n\\-Possible MBA in Cybersecurity (online via Harvard Extension or similar) or another sub-field, with an eye on higher-paying and interesting work. Ideally a longer-term position as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion for all the recruiters and experienced tech folk: are certifications something that stands out on a resume? What about a Graduate degree? How can I leverage my 12 years of business ownership and is it considered a \"positive\"?\n\nEdit: clarifying that I'm aware the market is tricky right now, but I am looking long term.

Lot of people get mad at you.","Sentiment":"Negative","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"The steady erosion of comfort in the modern workplace is nothing short of a cruel joke played on employees. Let's use a metaphor to better understand what's happening. \n\nImagine an airline ripping out every last shred of dignity from its flights - seats replaced with rigid boards that offer all the comfort of a medieval torture device; meals, once a highlight, are now nothing but a distant memory, replaced by vending machines; legroom reduced to the point where knees kiss chins and one must become a master contortionist just to squeeze into their designated sliver of space. They also introduce 'economy minus,' a tier replacing seats with standing spots and harnesses dangling from the overhead bins, promising an experience similar to a crowded subway ride at 30,000 feet. The in-flight entertainment system, once a portal to a few fleeting moments of escapism, now stares back as a blank screen, a grim reminder of better days gone by.  Flight attendants morph from angels of hospitality into sales agents peddling bogus lotteries for an extra inch of legroom or a blanket.\nMeanwhile, up in their gilded towers, airline executives scratch their heads in bewilderment as customers flee in droves, lamenting the ingratitude of the very passengers they've tortured. \n\nThe absurdity continues on land, this time for real, cloaked in a veneer of corporate doublespeak. Warm and welcoming offices gave way to sterile, exposed workspaces where privacy is forbidden and silence is a rare jewel. Colleagues transform into involuntary voyeurs as the open office serves up a psychological endurance test. The doors to quiet rooms are ripped off, replaced by signs reading 'Collaboration Zone', where multiple loud conversations blend into a disorienting swirl of noise. The remaining meeting rooms are always booked up. Employees roam like nomads in search of desks on a hot-desking carousel, not very different from a game of musical chairs. Individuality melts away as the office evolves into a panopticon, where all actions are viewed through the gaze of surveillance. Every bite, breath, and smelly bathroom break now has an audience.  \nHaving churned their workplaces into bleak blenders of distractions, executives cry out in shock as employees resist their calls to return to these very spaces designed to suffocate the soul. They cannot comprehend the mass exodus from the matrix of 'innovations' they've constructed. \"Get off your high horse!\" they decry, oblivious to the pain they've inflicted. \n\nThe imaginary decline of airline comfort is meant as a stark metaphor for the very real deterioration of office life. These so-called innovations expose a callous disconnect between executives and employees. As sanctuary emerges in the form of remote work, offering reprieve through autonomy and respect, the choice to skip the office becomes not just tempting, but essential. \n\nWhen comfort is ripped away and replaced with cruelty, remote work becomes the only rational response. This is why remote work is not going away any time soon.","Sentiment":"Negative","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"I work on site, but I 100% support remote work for your reasons listed!

Virtual assistants are basically personal assistants\/secretaries who work remotely from home and people have shared experiences and testimonies stating that people earn a lot just from working remotely. When I saw a job post on Indeed about becoming a remote Administrative Assistant for a certain real estate company, I took the opportunity. No harm in trying, right? I was accepted and hired.\n\nOn the first day of application, the employer screened applicants through Skype and Zoom, asking to see their internet speed tests and computer specifications. Those who were chosen were immediately asked to send a friend request to the employer's discord account and upon being accepted, the applicants were sent an invite to a server. Initially, we were notified that we will be training under the employer who also happens to be the CEO of the company but that we will be paid. We were given contracts that stated we were going to earn 13kphp as a starting salary and that we would be paid on the 1st and 16th of the month.\n\nDuring the first few weeks, the work was overwhelming and unfamiliar to all of us since we were all inexperienced with the job position but around the 2nd week, we were all given access to the employer's clients, handling the emails and documents within as her. Of course as inexperienced as we are, we were bound to make mistakes but the employer would often degrade and reprimand my coworkers in a public call on discord with everyone sitting there in uncomfortable silence. Around the 4th week which was my last week of work, I made an error that I admit I made. The next day I tried my best to amend my mistakes and did everything my employer asked me to do until suddenly they asked me to log off and that they would talk to me the next day.\n\n**I was suddenly removed off the work server with no explanation immediately afterwards.**\n\nI had a breakdown, questioning where I went wrong and what I did. I inquired them yet received no response for almost 24 hours. I inquired again about what the employer wanted to discuss with me only to be met with a cold response saying I was dismissed from work with no mention of compensation, no mention of what I did wrong or the promised 13kphp salary before cutting communication with me. I looked over the contract again and realized that I received an unsigned contract, that I was the only one who signed hence all the promises they stated were all false lies to drive us to do unpaid labor for the employer as them. I had assumed that the employer signed the contract as well after I gave them the contract with my signature on it and they acknowledged accepting it.\n\nIt was my mistake for merely assuming and for not securing the contract with the employer but let this be a lesson for anyone interested in working remotely as a Remote Virtual Assistant (Which was the job I signed up for) to always be mindful of your employers and the company to avoid being scammed and being unjustly treated to provide free and unpaid labor to them.","Sentiment":"Negative","Remote Work Relevance":"Useful for Remote Work"},{"text":"Context, I'm a28 year old self-motivated adaptive learner, and father of 3-under 3 with a phat nasty interest in learning job skills that will enable me to work from home, and from there break into other means of generating income from home.\n\nCybersecurity, data analysis, entry, etc. Anything that will, given proper effort, stand a good chance of netting around 32-35k annualy, and that I can pick up in 6 months of classes, courses, or again, just plain proper effort.

I've done it for years and pre-pandemic it was actually pretty easy to get a call center job for $18 - $20\/hr. And, wages were rising. Yeah, it's terrible work, but if you do well you can move off the phones and into something better. Since the pandemic people have learned they could have been working remotely with any customer service background so it's been flooded. Corporations figured out with a quickness that they could significantly lower wages because all of those people don't realize that not having a commute doesn't mean they can survive on $10\/hr.

Shoot, it's a royal pain in the ass for me to deal with and it's my actual job and I'm the one benefiting from working remotely in a state far away from the business' home base. \n\nThere are also concerns depending on the industry you're in.

Then you minus out reduced car insurance, reduced car repairs, reduced gas, reduced clothing allowance. So then you're maybe at $400 less a month. Then pay yourself your hourly rate of $50ish for the commute, that's at least $300.

Don't snack !  Sitting all day then add eating the same amount of meals is a no no .  Also, make yourself go out a few days a week and especially on weekends to stay social. .
