"I recently started a new job working remotely. I have a work laptop and some monitors they gave me to use. The thing is that I prefer my own home office setup which includes a couple of larger monitors on arms at my desk. If I used my personal computer to remote into my work laptop which is at home with me, is there any chance they can monitor my personal computers information/traffic through that connection. It doesn't seem like it to me but I like to make sure my personal data stays separate from my work life while still enjoying the home office I already have."
"For good or ill, many people rely on in-person relationships to further their careers. It's one reason that some folks have been reluctant to work remotely; they miss out on the opportunities for lunch with the boss, or the brainstorm session in the hallway. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" they say. But suddenly, with people working in home offices, everyone has to find new ways to show off.

I'm writing an article compiling practical how-to tips for people working from home on ""how to stay on your boss's radar"" and ""how to manage up."" What advice do you have to share?

Ideally: Give me a bullet point (""Do XYZ""), why (""It accomplishes \_this\_""), and perhaps an anecdote sharing how it made a difference.

Please don't expend energy telling me why it's important, or what the barriers are. Take that as a given. I'm looking for solid, actionable ""Do this"" suggestions from people who have personal experience or authoritative expertise."
"First of all, thanks for the responses in advance.

I'm moving to Northern Virginia, where I'll be residing for the foreseeable future. I was offered a relatively enticing full time remote work position in Miami (meaning, the office is in Miami but I would be working from home in NoVA full time), but before signing everything I'd really like to read up on remote work laws, particularly laws regarding working remotely from out of state.

I just really want to sort everything out and get more information, ranging from really important stuff like taxes (am I at risk of being taxed by both states?) to how does workplace law translate over to a remote work situation.

If you could point me over to a couple of resources where I could read into this or if you have any experience doing this kind of remote work, I'd be really grateful. Thanks!"

"Hello everyone, I'm wondering if there is a site or list of all the companies that are fully remote and let you work from anywhere in the world? Or at least almost anywhere. I've seen a lot of companies offering remote options, but most of them don't specify if you can work anywhere or it's only remote within the US. I plan on not staying in the US long term, so I'm looking specifically for companies that don't care where you live in the world. I'll maintain an address and residency somewhere for tax purposes, but I want the freedom to travel to different places around the world while I work and not have to worry about my employer caring or finding out. Which companies allow this? Has anyone made a list or should we compile one together?

Your thoughts?"
"There are some positive things about working in an office with other people:

* People can have coffee/lunch together to build friendships;
* There are watercooler conversations that could turn into ""aha"" moments for the team;
* Information can be shared easily with a team member by simply walking over to someone else or standing up to make an announcement.

If a team is remote, these situations can't happen in a physical space, so people need to make an effort to create these types of experiences in a virtual environment. Even with the best of intentions and the cultural desire to make this happen, the reality is if a large majority of the team is co-located in an office, it's difficult to remember or see the need to include the people who work remotely. Companies have varying scenarios in which individuals are considered to be remote workers; some employees work in the main office, while others might work in satellite offices or from home. Moreover, some companies have no offices at all! There is a danger zone in terms of the number of employees in an organization that has some part of the team working remotely. Being in this zone can be very difficult for both the employee and the company.

Here's the spectrum I mean:  [https://imgur.com/a/ixze0Do](https://imgur.com/a/ixze0Do)

Let's look at the possible scenarios:

* **A company in which 100% of the employees work in one office**. In this scenario, the company has no employees that work remotely. Everyone is in the office five days a week, or maybe working from home is an unusual exception. There is no issue here because everyone benefits from the watercooler effect described above.
* **A company in which 99.9999% of the employees work in one office**. If one individual works remotely, he/she is not privy to all the watercooler benefits that being in an office would provide. However, the overhead costs needed to develop a remote-enabled infrastructure or culture for one remote employee doesn't make sense. The person who works remotely has the hardest time obtaining information from the team since he/she is easily forgotten and most communications and meetings happen face-to-face. You've probably seen it before: your public Slack channels are dead and the comments on your GitHub issues are non-existent. Unless the person really needs zero context apart from the tasks assigned to him/her, this isn't an issue. However, if the remote employee must make any decisions that depend on input from others, or if his/her input could be used to help make decisions, this could hurt the company. This negative outcome can occur until a large percentage of the company's work force is remote.
* **A company in which around 50% of the employees work remotely and/or in satellite offices**. Once a company has enough remote employees that must be included in conversations to move the company forward, the lack of information dissemination/conversations with everyone in the company has a major impact on the decisions that must be made for the organization. Once a company hits this point, moving to an asynchronous communication and implementing online company management strategies is really the only way to continue with the remote practices. Once this is established and people feel they are contributing to meaningful decisions, they can work from home, or, the key indicator, work from anywhere in the world without being less productive (or even more productive). This is an effective way to ensure the health of a remote-enabled company.
* **A company in which 100% of the employees work remotely**. Once the majority of a company's employees work remotely, and the organization is moving along smoothly, the hardest part is over. Growing to a situation in which 100% of workers are remote (if that's the desire) is not as challenging as going from 0% remote workers to 50% remote workers.

The key takeaway here is that while having a remote team creates a strong competitive advantage for a company, there are growing pains as teams shift from having a small number of individuals working remotely to a large number. Having this in mind during the growth phase will help the transition. Knowing is half the battle.

If you like this stuff, I'm writing a book on it. It's free until it's all done: [https://leanpub.com/remote-dev-teams/](https://leanpub.com/remote-dev-teams/). I also post random stuff here: [https://www.theremotecto.com](https://www.theremotecto.com)"
"I'm a mobile developer. I see a lot of remote jobs posted from the US and EU scaled around 60-120k/year. I feel I'm confident to hold these jobs but when I apply for these jobs maximum time it says candidates must be in US or EU regions. But for some unavoidable issues, I can't leave my country but my current job's salary scale is too low to maintain a healthy and smooth lifestyle. I feel if I can manage a remote job which a scale just like US or EU then it will be possible for me to maintain a sound lifestyle in my own country by spending some extra money.

"Hello lovely people here, I am from Indian and after my Bachelors ( B.Tech. ) in ICT I got depressed as my grades were miscalculated so I fought with them and completed and came home in July '17 and after 10 months I have started applying here for office jobs as well but I'm having really bad experience in terms of people offering as shitty as 

# US$150 per month.

Which makes me feel really low. Though I am just fascinated by the work and technology that I can use to create and put on any web apps that I could. 

* I have been practicing Python Django and then I moved to Node.js Express.js MongoDB and I have practiced to create several complete apps with server side rendering with EJS templates. 

* I am also planning to start with LeetCode to get better jobs in as fast as 3-6 months because any job I will get will be really low paying ( Rs30k ~ US$440 per month).

So the jist is can you guys please tell suggest on what things I should try/practice and work upon, I am definitely going to go through the top post on this sub and try to read, search, implement as much as I can in my real life.

 * But I would love to hear from you guys your opinions on how should I proceed and what things should I take care of to avoid pitfalls from your experiences.

"I just landed an excellent job that will challenge me in my career.  I work in Cloud.  The great thing besides nearly doubling my salary is that I work remote.

This is a double edge sword for me.  Where I came from in my previous company was a Google-esque company.  Very engaging and frenetic in a good way.  You always had people around you.  It was to a point it was almost invasive, but the company culture changed a few years back and now it's being a bit stagnant and has silos.

I still thing going in the office and having the option to work from home on days is great.  I'm not sure about the 100% remote thing.  I'm a bit scared that I will self isolate myself.

I also think that I will be one of the younger guys there being in my early 30s.  My last company much of the work force was under 35. So there may be a slight culture shift for me.

The company itself seems very engaging and still much into a start up mode and there will be travel.  No doubt about the company.  I just feel that remote work will make me go crazy and I won't be able to have a social life.  I fear being alone.

What do you guys do to cope with this?  "

"I've been trying to push the rest of the leadership team where I work to be more accepting of remote workers.

I am not a lawyer, so I don't know how to respond to one particular question that came up.

In the days before telecommuting, it was normal that the country that someone lived in was always the same as the country of the employer. And so if a company was incorporated in country A, then of course everyone employed by the company had to have the right to work in country A because otherwise they wouldn't be able to turn up to the office.

I always assumed that a visa that gave you the right to work in a country was giving you the right to live in that country and work there. I always assumed that if you are employing someone from country B when your company was incorporated in country A, that the employee needed a ""right to work"" in country B only. Work rights to country A were irrelevant if the person was never going to step foot in country A.

But everyone else seems to assume that in that situation, the employee needs work rights in country A as well, even though they will never pass through immigration in country A, so no-one will ever know whether they actually had work rights there or not.

Does anyone know what the situation is?

P.S. Australian company, but I think it's an interesting question for all sorts of countries."

Hi all,

I am conducting a piece of academic research on the leadership issues that arise from managing remote teams.

I am looking to ask managers or business owners who have worked with a remote team in the past (or currently still doing so) some questions about your experiences.

Thank you for your time."
"Hi all,

I've been working 95% remotely as a freelancer for the past several months, and I might be about to take a 100% remote position as a full-time employee.

I wanted to ask about something that's been bothering me, because I can't be the only one who's experienced this.

As a remote worker, how do you deal with being ignored? There seems to be an ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality that some people have toward people on a team who are remote--you can't blame them for it, since when remote workers are the minority, it's natural. I have a few techniques I use to combat it, like overcommunicating in comment threads, linking between threads, making sure to communicate through public chat channels, etc., just basically making myself as visible as possible in spite of not physically being there.

However, I've noticed that with some people, it's not that they're innocently not thinking of me because they don't see me. They seem to be blatantly ignoring me. This actually isn't even specific to remote work. In my last full-time job, there were certain people who I just could never get a hold of. I would politely send them emails and chat messages during regular working hours, and they would take 5+ hours to respond, if they responded at all. The only way I could get their attention is if I went up to their desk, and just stood there until they were forced to acknowledge me. With remote work that isn't even an option.

With one freelance client I have now, I only live about 30 minutes away from their office, so I COULD go in if I wanted to--but I feel that I should not have to be coerced into doing it when it isn't necessary. That place is a whole 'nother issue though, they've been trying (unsuccessfully) to manipulate me into being a traditional employee that sits in the office all day for months now, and I'm not having it. I should probably set them straight or just abandon the contract, but I genuinely like the work I'm doing for them.

With companies that ""believe in"" remote work and are properly set up for it, I haven't had any issues like these.

Maybe I'm just not being assertive enough. Do any of you have any experiences you're willing to share?"
"I was thinking about the time I spent a few years ago remotely managing a team of about a dozen engineers at Mozilla.

I believe I was a reasonably effective manager, but I'm sure there is always room for lots of improvement.

If you are a remote employee working for a manager on-site, or remote with a remote manager, or on-site with a remote manager, what things do you feel are the most important for that manager to focus on to be effective. I'm specifically curious about the things that might be different in some fashion from what would be expected or typical if both you and your manager were on-site.

"Hey everyone!

I apologize in advance if this type of post is unacceptable in this sub.

**However...**

So I've developed this website for about a year. It's called [Periodix](https://periodix.net/), Artificial Intelligence that searches or browses jobs from all over the web for you. It shows projects with the highest chances to be hired for you.

**Main Purpose:**

\- It finds remote or otherwise flexible jobs from all over the web leveraging AI

\- It saves your time for searching projects for your profile.

\-You see the possibility of being hired on a job.

**Website features:**

\- Google Chrome Extention for getting new updates faster;

\- Jobs without scams. Periodix analyses all projects and it shows real projects for you;

\- You save your time for searching because of everything in one place;

\- You can filter jobs for your interests, budget, and country;

\- Periodix shows projects for your location;

\- You can teach the algorithm if a project isn't for your skills.

**Note on the above:**

We continue to add new job boards. You can get more projects every month.

**A few limitations:**

\- The website IS NOT PERFECT.

\- Since this is largely an aggregator, you may occasionally see some repeat entries, or even NON-remote jobs. That's why you can teach the algorithm for making it better.

**Some fun / useless facts, in case this matters at all:**

You save up to 10 hours per week by getting a personal list of jobs that match your skills and have a high chance of hiring.

Please let me know if you encounter any thoughts.

I believe you find it useful.

"Hey guys,

Not sure about everyone else, but we've always felt that finding a telecommuting job is tougher than a traditional job, since very few companies offer them. It takes a lot of research to separate the wheat from the weeds.

So we decided to do something about it.

We've recently launched a tech-focused job board that aims to help telecommuters find high-quality remote careers:

http://jobspresso.co

Compared to other remote job boards, we spend time to ensure every remote job is legitimate and open, by reviewing the employer's website, career page, social media accounts and general reputation. The end result is that you only see real remote jobs at interesting and thriving companies. We take care of the legwork so you don't have to.

We're really excited about launching this site, and hopefully you'll find it useful. 

What do you guys think? Is there anything that we can do better? "

I am tired of feeling jealous of folks who get to travel and see the world while working and earning their living, I would love to make the leap but am unsure about how I should go about it. 

Brief background and skills overview: 

I was born in Russia, raised in the US, went to school and college in France and the UK. Fluency in the three languages at a level that makes native speakers believe I am one. (hold French and Russian citizenship). MSc degrees from Paris and London engineering schools, honours from the British one which is quite a good school in the UK (Imperial College London). 

Degrees are in Physics but went into coding then (just had enough of labwork, but the physics and statistics background is there). Did lots of coding in c++ for theses, some obscure stuff like LabView, Matlab, Mathematica. Working at a bank since graduated, just five years now, the oldies there taught me mainframe (so that's Cobol, JCL, DB2 SQL, TSO and the whole caboodle that goes with it) and the last two years have been honing me into an old tech/new tech hybrid (they want to train a data scientist, they said). 

They are really nice, the people at work :) But I don't want to climb a career ladder, I want to be free and travel :) 

Surely I should be able to do something with this ;_; Without the need to branch out yet again into web dev or whatnot (?) I can pick another coding language (or 'language' language) up quite easily I reckon, if need be. 

Opinions? Please please please and thanks again! Have a great day :)

"Am I the only one that finds it borderline offensive that people think landing a well paying remote job is as simple as snapping your fingers?

"I've been working exclusively remotely for almost two years now, and it's been a revolution in my life.

I can't understand why employers would insist that their employees return to the office when they can work from home, except perhaps to occupy the office space they rent.

Who wants to :

\- Be stuck in traffic for hours

\- Dress up in office mode every morning

\- Cashing in on the commute

\- Miss out on magical moments with your loved ones

\- Running out of time to live your passions and enjoy life The world of work isn't what it used to be.

We've redefined what's ""normal"".

Companies need to wake up and embrace change.

"I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it. I know I made a lot of dumb mistakes, but I want to fix my situation. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "
"I see lots of posts here about people saying ""I want to work remote, how do I get a remote job?"" Look, if this is you, you're going about this the wrong direction. What exactly are you going to do remote?

Call center work, things like that or customer service, any remote job that doesn't have requirements, is going to get thousands of applications. It is like playing the lottery to land one of those jobs. And they're soul crushing. 

What you need is a skill or ability that is in demand that can be done at home. Then you need to get really good at that skill so you can negotiate a work from home position. They're not just gonna hand it out usually it is a thing you have to earn. 

So basically, there is no quick fix. It took me 10 years to develop enough skill that I could tell my boss I'm working from home from now on. Get started on a skill you're interested in."
"I've started working remotely with COVID and it's now a lifestyle many of us have embraced forever. But with the freedom of a home office comes unique challenges--staying productive, maintaining work-life balance, and navigating the nuances of virtual communication, just to name a few. Here are some life hacks I found very valuable for myself to find a good balance working remotely.

**Get Outside**

Just 15 minutes out in the sun can help set your circadian rhythm, fire up your metabolism, and get your brain into high gear.

**2-3 hours work out of your home-set up to enter flow**

Contrary to popular belief, remote work doesn't confine you to your home. I've found that a change of scenery can do wonders for entering a state of flow. I start the workday at home, and when I notice a dip in productivity, I relocate to a nearby cafe for a focused 2-3 hour work session. This shift not only rejuvenates my creative juices but also acts as a mental 'reset,' helping me tackle tasks with renewed vigor.

**Meditate, even if it is 10 mins.**

If we can't chill alone for 10 mins without checking our phones, we've got a big problem. Meditation is like the mental gym. You're training your brain to slow down, focus, and just *be.* I swear, it's like rebooting your brain.

If you start by your own you'll be overwhelmed; look on Youtube for ""guided meditation"" (you can find 5, 10, 15 and more videos depending on how you want to start). Also **Headpace** or **calm** have beginner guides usually for free.

**Say Thanks, Feel Better**

I've started jotting down five things I'm grateful for every day. Sounds simple, but does it change the game. When you focus on what you're thankful for, it's like you're hardwiring your brain to be happier. I'm talking better mood, stronger friendships, and even better health.

**Write it Out**

Very similar to the previous one, I've found that jotting down my thoughts every day is crazy beneficial. It's like I'm decluttering my brain. Plus, my communication skills have gone up a notch. You're going to need that, especially if you're aiming for success in today's world. There are also tons of apps for making journaling more enjoyable, like **Dayone, Diarium, Penzu**... Many of them are free.

**Get a Wise Council**

The most successful people have mentors or a coach. Imagine getting life advice from someone who's already walked the path you're on. It's like life-hacking with cheat codes. The impact of this can't be overstated. So, seek out someone who's a few steps ahead of you in the game and absorb their wisdom like a sponge. Now with AI there are also some AI coaches that are a great way to start, because coaching is all about asking yourself the right question. **Wave coaching** is a good one.

**Self-Care Isn't Selfish**

We're so busy grinding away for someone else that we forget to invest in the most important project: ourselves. Take 30 minutes daily to read, work out, or learn something new. Think of it as a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.

**Read, really read**

You'd be surprised how few people actually read regularly. Set aside some time to dive into a book--any book--that piques your interest. It's like compound interest for your brain.

**Cold shower in the morning**

This might sound nuts, but taking a 3-minute cold shower gives you this weird boost for the whole day. It's like you're shocking your body into beast mode. Seriously, try it.

**Bed time alarm**

Don't underestimate the power of a good night's sleep. Set an alarm to remind you to start winding down. Ditch the tech, maybe read something light, and just chill. You're setting the stage for a killer day ahead.

Let me know if you have any other habits I should add to the post"
"I have a full time remote position at a very large company with thousands of employees. I like the work. I like my boss and coworkers. The pay is decent. I'm a responsible, hard worker with many years of experience and I can be trusted to do my work productively with no supervision. The problem is my employer's policies are, in my opinion, incredibly overbearing and treat me as if I'm an untrustworthy child.  I'm heavily monitored and micromanaged. Therefore, I'm thinking about looking for a new job but I'm worried that the way my company does things is now ""the norm"" and I wouldn't find a better situation so I don't know if it's worth bothering. 

At my job, I am required to be on camera all day,  every day, so they can take frequent photos of me to make sure I'm working. I HATE this. It's not because I'm lazy. I'm always at my desk working other than bathroom breaks. It's because I feel it is incredibly invasive and I feel like I can't scratch my face or eat a snack without someone watching. When you're at work in person,  your boss doesn't sit across from you staring at you intensely all day, and I feel the constant camera monitoring is the equivalent of that. I'm also not allowed to listen to music, have my phone, or have pets or another person in the room. The stated reason for the last few is fraud concerns, despite the fact I have no access to sensitive info. In my opinion, to want this much control over me and what goes on in my home is ridiculous.

On social media I see other WFH people talking about napping and going to the gym during the workday. I don't want that and in my opinion people who pull that shit are ruining WFH for the rest of us by making us look bad. However it DOES make me wonder if I just chose a bad company and most aren't like this. 

Please tell me this isn't the norm now. If it is, I might as well get an in-person job again. Ideally, I want a remote job where I'm not required to be on camera except for Zoom/Teams meetings and where the environment is relaxed enough that I can listen to Spotify and have my pets in the room. Is it possible?"

Currently pregnant and planning on staying home for at least a year. I've been searching around but to be honest I don't know what to look for. I've worked in the medical field mostly my whole life and worked as a receptionist once. Any advice on what I can look for or something that could help me out? Maybe make my own ours or something. I've seen a couple of websites where you can make your own ours but don't really know if it's legit"
"Here's the deal:

- Traffic's a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won't feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we're not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread. Remember COVID?
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can't work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless. Remote work's making everyone's day a bit easier, even if your office is still your second home."
"The steady erosion of comfort in the modern workplace is nothing short of a cruel joke played on employees. Let's use a metaphor to better understand what's happening. 

Imagine an airline ripping out every last shred of dignity from its flights - seats replaced with rigid boards that offer all the comfort of a medieval torture device; meals, once a highlight, are now nothing but a distant memory, replaced by vending machines; legroom reduced to the point where knees kiss chins and one must become a master contortionist just to squeeze into their designated sliver of space. They also introduce 'economy minus,' a tier replacing seats with standing spots and harnesses dangling from the overhead bins, promising an experience similar to a crowded subway ride at 30,000 feet. The in-flight entertainment system, once a portal to a few fleeting moments of escapism, now stares back as a blank screen, a grim reminder of better days gone by.  Flight attendants morph from angels of hospitality into sales agents peddling bogus lotteries for an extra inch of legroom or a blanket.
Meanwhile, up in their gilded towers, airline executives scratch their heads in bewilderment as customers flee in droves, lamenting the ingratitude of the very passengers they've tortured. 

The absurdity continues on land, this time for real, cloaked in a veneer of corporate doublespeak. Warm and welcoming offices gave way to sterile, exposed workspaces where privacy is forbidden and silence is a rare jewel. Colleagues transform into involuntary voyeurs as the open office serves up a psychological endurance test. The doors to quiet rooms are ripped off, replaced by signs reading 'Collaboration Zone', where multiple loud conversations blend into a disorienting swirl of noise. The remaining meeting rooms are always booked up. Employees roam like nomads in search of desks on a hot-desking carousel, not very different from a game of musical chairs. Individuality melts away as the office evolves into a panopticon, where all actions are viewed through the gaze of surveillance. Every bite, breath, and smelly bathroom break now has an audience.  
Having churned their workplaces into bleak blenders of distractions, executives cry out in shock as employees resist their calls to return to these very spaces designed to suffocate the soul. They cannot comprehend the mass exodus from the matrix of 'innovations' they've constructed. ""Get off your high horse!"" they decry, oblivious to the pain they've inflicted. 

The imaginary decline of airline comfort is meant as a stark metaphor for the very real deterioration of office life. These so-called innovations expose a callous disconnect between executives and employees. As sanctuary emerges in the form of remote work, offering reprieve through autonomy and respect, the choice to skip the office becomes not just tempting, but essential. 

When comfort is ripped away and replaced with cruelty, remote work becomes the only rational response. This is why remote work is not going away any time soon."

"Hi!

I'm wondering if anyone knows any work from home opportunities or tips for a SAHM? I have 1 year and 7 months office administration/receptionist experience and I have an Educational Assistant diploma but couldn't pursue the career as it's very mentally draining for me. I do have childcare arrangements (my husband works from home and his mother lives with us so she can take care of my son while we work) 

Also, I live in Canada if that helps 


Thanks!"

"I work and live in California, I own my condo about a 2 hour drive away from the office in LA with traffic. I'm full time remote but sometimes I'll go in to show face.

My current predicament is that my wife and I want to buy a bigger house and start a family but obviously the closer we get to LA the houses get way more expensive. We've thought about moving further away in California which would be much more affordable for us. 

Would I screw myself buying a home further away when I'm not sure if my career would allow me to work from home forever? Moving up in position makes this unclear for me.

Has anyone gone through this before?
Thanks!"
"As someone who was hired in a role that is 100% remote, I imagined that I'd never go back to an office (I work in tech) but woke up this morning and saw this article in the observer ([Link](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/aug/12/never-again-is-britain-finally-ready-to-return-to-the-office?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other)) that suggests otherwise.  


I don't think my firm will ever have an office, and working from home works out great for me and my colleagues, but is this something other people's employers have started talking about? How would returning to the office make you feel and what would you miss most about the flexibility of being able to work from home?  


Personally for me, working from home is something that brings a huge amount of value to my life, I have family abroad and being able to flex my hours to find cheap flights and work from my Grandma's house for a week or so makes all the difference to me (and possibly her) .  


TL;DR - do we think returning to the office is going to happen sooner rather than later and what would you do if your employer asked you to return to the office?

"Searching for a remote job now. I found one that I'm totally perfect for. It pays 60k.  Was offered another job closer to what I like doing, tops out at 95k, pension bonus vacation all that jazz, but it's in an office.   I'm totally torn.  What would you do? I'd give up a lot to work from home but this might be too good to pass up."
"I see so many say they're looking for entry level remote work that :

* Has flexible hours - show up whenever, work however long you want with breaks whenever and however long you want

* Allows you to travel and work from anywhere in the world

* Can be done while taking care of a newborns or toddlers

* Is easy and pays very well

* Can be done at the same time as another job 

Unless you have a degree and experience, most remote work doesn't include any of the above. 

I'm speaking from both sides of this coin. I was a supervisor with a semi-flexible schedule. I was primary and then sole caregiver for my son as he grew, but I wasn't on phones when he was young / in the ""could start screaming any second with no advance warning"" stage. I could often start work earlier than scheduled, and then take off early, but not always - if I had a meeting scheduled at the end of my normal shift, I was stuck. If I was working on a proposal of some sort, I could do quite a bit in my head while folding laundry or doing the dishes.  The pay was good, but the stress on my mental and physical health was bigger, and that's why I eventually quit. 

Currently in a specialist / customer service roll. Shifts are set and I can't start early. Even breaks and lunch are scheduled at specific times. Clocking in late (5 minutes is late) leads to occurrence points which add up to termination. Leaving early accrues the same occurrence points. The metrics you have to meet can be very stressful. You can't always get the days off that you want approved. 

Obviously not all remote jobs will fail the bullet points. I'd love to hear from folks who have alternate experiences to share."

"I've been searching for WFH/Remote Work FT Jobs since last year. Generally speaking, I've noticed some positions only accept applications from certain provinces, usually excluding Quebec, notwithstanding for bilingual jobs specifically.   
I suppose the reason for this is because these WFH-only-type-Corporations don't want to deal with Revenue Quebec's processes or taxation, or their clients don't. (???)

My question is this : are there better Provinces to be situated in that gives one more opportunities to apply to such WFH/Remote work positions?   
Such as Alberta, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or New Foundland?

"IFL remote work. Fucking love it. It is the future.

What kind of hell will capitalism make remote work?

The year is 2075. The last corporate office lease has expired. All the office buildings are gyms, restaurants, and housing. My daughter wakes up in her studio apartment. She gets out of bed at 7:55am. She has not showered or left the house in weeks. She makes a protein smoothie, puts her Meta Headset on. She logs in at 8:01am. An AI manager says, ""Good morning Alecia, I would like to remind you that work started at 8am"" She gets a 'bad point' on her profile. Her 'Meta Score' score drops from a 759 to a 758. Irritaded, she starts responding to emails. Her mom's birthday is today and she pauses to shoot her a text. Her AI manager pops in her headset and says ""Good morning, I see your email response rate has dropped 4.7% this morning. Please remember we have a corporate policy of [xyz] send rate. This is your second warning so your pay is now being deducted, as per your employment agreement.""

"2 years of flexibility, an improved work life balance, more productive work day, extra quality time with family and well being, additional savings, etc. POOF it's gone just like that.

My kids have soccer practice on Tuesdays at 5 PM. I can take them... oh wait, I can't - I'll be commuting home from work because Tuesday is a mandatory in office day. That's right, mandatory. Tuesday and Wednesday are now ""core"" days.

It doesn't stop there.

We also have to come in for a third day that ""works"" for the team. How are we going to organize that? Most people are going to want to work Mondays and Fridays from home. In order to take my kids to tee ball on Thursdays, I'll need to work from home that day. That pretty much guarantees that I will be the only one from my team in the office on Monday.

Really effective use of time and resources, right?

But, Tom, can't your partner take the kids to tee ball? Nope. She works in a hospital. She legitimately needs to be there in person. She works with patients and families during some of their most difficult times. Being there in person is very important for the emotional well being of the people she's there to help.

I, on the other hand, can easily work remote 100% of the time. There's no urgent need for me to be physically present. Even if I wanted to see the people I work with, I can't. The majority of them are hundreds to thousands of miles away. Nonetheless, my company wants me to spend 3 hours a day commuting in order to sit in an office just to have virtual meetings. Really effective use of time and resources, right?

Oh well, at least I can help my partner in the mornings getting the kids ready for school... oh wait, I can't - I'll be commuting. In order for me to make it in the office by 9:00 AM, I need to leave at 7:30 AM. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to say goodbye before I leave.

Purposeful in-office time is OK, but this one-size fits all approach for the sake of ""company culture"" is 3 steps backwards.

"Hi everyone! Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of working remote. Absolutely love it, and won't ever go back to the office drag. But surely there are things we don't like about remote.

"I have been working for the same small company for over 15 years.  I started working remotely about 10 years ago when I had my first child.  The job I was doing at the time involved a component in which I was the only one that did it and therefore didn't need to have communication with people in the office.  So I left my full time job and kept that one part as my remote job. I was working for a micromanager to the extreme at the time and after working from home I got more work done than when I was in the office.

Over the years I've slowly taken on more projects.  I'm still part time but getting closer to full time.

My amazing boss who I experienced so much growth and confidence under was let go recently.  They re-hired the micromanager who had mostly retired and will be working from home because she lives outside of the state.  Something important to know about her is she is very adamant and serious about NEVER having a ""not my job"" attitude as a way to get people to do work on things she can't get someone else for or needs help with.

The office has had a hard time keeping the few admin staff they have and the office manager has joked with me multiple times over the years that she wishes I came back to help.  Well, she has recently mentioned in casual conversation that I'm likely going to become my bosses assistant because instead of focusing on my actual job she will expect help with projects.

Recently I found out the President of the parent company wants our branch to end remote work because he thinks people will work better when they exchange ideas in person.

The entire department I work in and the other department I work with are scattered throughout the US.  Each person but one was hired while living outside the state pre-pandemic.  One moved during. The CEO of our branch doesn't even live in the state.

Then, in my conversation with the President, he said something that made my stomach drop after already feeling bad about the remote work part.  He said ""then, since you will be in the office, you can help with admin stuff.""  I knew then that the remote working ending really just means me since I am the only one that I work with that lives in state and that this is about using me for the help I can provide, since they can't find someone else and I've been ""loyal"" for so long.

I am actively trying to find a new job but I absolutely do not want to come back and do not want to be demoted into helping everyone else.  But I am TERRIFIED of how my boss will react if I give her pushback.  I am not in a place mentally to handle that well.

"Hey folks, I am trying to decide whether or not to keep my current ""remote"" status at work or to transition to working in-office four days a week. I'd love any advice or helpful perspectives!

tl;dr Should I switch from working fully remotely near DC to working in the DC office four days a week? In-office comes with a pay bump, but also takes away the ""work from home"" perks.

For a little context...I am a 24 year old, single woman. I've worked in our Tech Comm department as a senior technical writer for over two years now and I like my job pretty well. I was hired during the pandemic when everyone at my company was working remotely, so I have never met anyone at my company in person. My team and supervisor now work from our California office, whereas I still work remotely from my apartment near our Washington, DC, office. When everyone returned to the office after the pandemic died down, our company gave us a choice. We could stay remote and keep our same pay, OR we could decide to come into the office four days a week, one day remote, but we would get a pay bump to account for commuting and cost of living. The ""locality"" pay percentage is based on which office we were commuting to (DC vs Cali). At the time, I chose to stay remote because my life was hectic, and I also figured commuting to the office would not be worth it since all my direct coworkers would be at the Cali office, and I would be commuting to DC.

I am considering changing my status to ""in-person"" and commuting to DC four days a week.

The pros: the pay bump (since I am paying to live near DC anyways and would just be adding in commuting costs, it would be a nice raise...also I have some credit card debt to pay off right now so money would be helpful), having more social interaction and meeting new people (working from home gets lonely), I think I would focus on work better/improve my work ethic, I could network better in-person with people even if they are not my direct coworkers, and I am kinda looking for a change. I graduated with my B.S. in the spring of 2020, so I have not been in a classroom, office, etc., since the world shut down. Also, if I decide I hate working in-office and want to switch back to remote, I have to give HR a month's notice, and they will allow it. Obviously, the pay bump goes away then.

The cons: commuting every day will be a pain sometimes, I know. I would take the metro rail/public transport, which is cheaper than driving but less predictable. I also would need to have a more stringent work schedule since, right now, I can easily accommodate later meetings/Pacific time zone for my Cali colleagues when needed. I will need to take PTO for things I am not used to, like if I want to visit family at the holidays I cannot just work from Minnesota for two weeks. It will also just be a big adjustment for me since it's been a long time since I have had to make sure I show up to an office on time or actually get up and look professional in the morning (we don't have cameras on over Zoom at my work). I will also just have less free time in my day, whether it be morning or evening. Let's be honest, working from home is nice in that sense....somedays I will work in pajamas outside on my patio. That is a luxury I would lose...Finally, given that most of my direct coworkers and people I ""interact"" with at work are in the Cali office, I really will not know anyone at the DC office and it may feel just as lonely as working from home.

Anyways, does anyone have any advice or perspective maybe from personal experience? I'd love to hear your thoughts."
"Has anyone had experience or heard of anyone applying for an in-person role and negotiating to make it remote friendly? I'm wondering if I'd be able to apply for a role that says it's in person and then ask if I can work from home. Is this possible?

"Hi there, I hope you are well. Just looking for some advice.

I am currently a teacher in Bangkok, originally from the UK. I love living away from the uk and love Thailand as a whole, however I am getting a bit fed up of having to be in a certain place at a certain time. I just want a bit more freedom in my life, I've still got quite an urge to travel more. My job pays okay for Thailand however outside of the country it's a struggle. I'd earn a lot more if I was doing a basic job in the uk for example. I am just looking for some advice on how to get a job that allows me to work remotely, preferably from a western company, inclusion of Aus and NZ too. I completely understand it is difficult to find this work and I am not expecting to just apply and get a job right away. I am just asking what skills do you think I should master first before trying to get into the remote space. My degree is in media and communications. Thank you"
"The past week or two we've seen a flurry of articles talking about ""the return to office"" movement is dead. But after seeing some stats in the article and doing some digging it seems like remote work may be dead. 

So here's some of the most shocking stats I saw. Now in fairness stats are all over the place and certain articles and studies choose to push for WFH or return to office but from what I was able to gether... prior to covid something like 6% of workers were fully remote. During covid I saw a stat that 71% of workers were fully remote, that kind of surprised me it was that high, today apparently 12% of workers are fully remote. Now granted I'd say that probably a majority of workers are hybrid now which I think still sort of qualifies as remote and that's a win but were basically we've seen an 83% drop in remote work in the past year or two since covid measures ended. 

Overall it seems like most ofthe push of big companies going back into the office is done with the exception of Boeing, GM and one other that's slipping my mind at the moment. The current push seems to be federal, state and municipal public workers being pushed back into the office. 

I can't see a scenario where enmass a lot of companies decide to go remote at this point so it seems remote work is kinda dead. Agree or disagree?"

"I won't tell you my qualifications, my job experience or where I'm from. I also won't look at this subreddit for more than 8 seconds or try to use the search function. God forbid trying to look _outside of Reddit_ for information on remote jobs.

Please, I really need a remote job. More than other, more qualified people. You don't understand, I couldn't possibly learn a skill, get local work experience or anything like that. I also haven't applied seriously for any jobs at this point.

Why can't I just find a decent paying, entry level remote job with no effort, work experience or self taught skills?

The world is so unfair."
"I see a lot of people wanting to work remote so figured I'd post this. I worked as a regulator in the state of Arizona. All state jobs have the option of working completely remote, hybrid, or on site (you get to pick). Pay is pretty good (I was making 65/year, plenty of people make 70k+ there), and they have a shared office for state workers (kinda like a WeWork) with snacks and whatnot. Benefits are also great.

 However there are some caveats...

1. You must work within state lines. You can work remote from anywhere in Arizona, but barring extreme circumstances (aka family member in another state dying) you cannot work outside of state lines. Even if you travel to California for vacay, you will not be allowed to log in to work.


2. The state does offer a pension. Mind you, you will be required to contribute ~12.5% per paycheck. They do match, but you only get the march after 10 years of service. But it's for all 10 years. So if you quit at year 9, you only get your contributions. If you hit year 10, you get the last 10 years of employer matching and every year past that 10 year mark.


3. There is a good amount of competition for these jobs given the remote work environment. But if you're willing to relocate and you get an interview, you're in a good spot.


Also, mind you, this is for the ""state of Arizona"". The city of Phoenix or Maricopa county jobs I don't think offer remote work options (or they might but limited) so just make sure you keep an eye on that.


Good luck!"
"Before, remote jobs were this freelance haven where you could catch projects from any corner of the Earth and without any beaurocratic issues. But I've noticed in the last year that everyone now requires you to live in the country of the company, have a working visa and constantly report to the IRS absolutely every cent it gets into your bank account. So even with a good track record of professional work including remote, the fiscal laws changed so much that we can't basically do anything anymore. Companies can't afford to hire remote because of location and is difficult for someone like me because I'm not in an industry where there is one central hub/city and the projects are developing in different countries depending on investment.

As a context, I'm a game artist and 3D designer. I've worked for a few years in office and then COVID happened and used it as an opportunity to work remote. I've managed to get a job remotely and honestly I've worked way more efficiently but at the same time I was doing more hours. But to me it was fine as I like my job."
"With all these posts of ""where can I find a remote job with Zero experience"" or ""what Job can I get while staying at home with my pet llamas""

I thought I could post a success story about what it took for me to get to this offer. (btw it's an offer I might not actually take)

**A bit about my skills (the class of skills you need to even be considered for Remote Work)**

* I have an Doctorate in a technology field. On top of my stellar academic and research background I hold 2 premium professional certifications that are directly applicable for the work I do. Much like a Professional Engineer or Board Certified MD, I have credentials that not everyone in my technical field has, one I think less than 1000 world wide have attained it.

**Brief information about the industry I work in.**

* The industry I do remote work in is very very clique-y. For example there are technology providers in my industry a company may use equipment from Vendor A or Vendor B. My background is with nearly ALL the vendors in my field so unlike many people I do not get rejected because oh Tech does not have experience with X Vendor.
* I have 20+ years of experience and 10 years of direct experience in the job I will be remotely working. I have worked for a competitor to this company 2 years ago. I know the job I will be doing and did it well for my previous similar employer.

**Why did the position I am applying for go ""Remote""?**

* The reason it was shifted to remote was that people with my skills and background are very very RARE. While most positions at this company are NOT remote they reluctantly made this a remote position so that they have a ""chance"" of hiring someone like me. 
* Also for this particular company I do not reside in any city they have major operations. I made this a prerequisite for any job I take. IF I take a job for a company with offices in my area... eventually I will be ""volun-told"" to go into the office... thus no longer having a ""remote"" position.

**What was the job search like?**

* All and all it took 9 solid months of passive interviewing, calling and otherwise seeking a new remote position. I started remote with my current position and they have now made me ""hybrid"" and I don't like going into the office that much so I decided to look.
* So it's a good thing to realize I have stellar education, I have stellar experience, I have stellar certifications... and even for ME remote work is NOT a slam dunk. I have applied/interviewed for around 30 positions. So again even for people like me who have a great deal of demand for their skills and work. Remote positions are STILL pretty hard to get.

**Things I learned in looking for a Remote Work Position**

* Passive looking is the BEST for ultimately landing a fully Remote position. I can't tell you the times that if I actually apply for a position they pull the ""bait and switch"" and say we don't do fully Remote, this will be Hybrid or in office. To which I always said nope!
* Today people ARE NOT willing to interview you outside of business hours (in my experience) so you have to juggle the interviews during work days. Luckily my present work is flexible. But for people who are in the office again I think taking interviews will be more difficult.
* Be prepared for a few false flags and fake remote positions. I had one recruiter swear to me that X company would do remote when I had worked at that company and KNEW they did not. Also a few companies changed their policy of hiring of people outside their office areas during interviews.
* Get used to a lot of bureaucracy with companies these days. Remote work is complex to account for if a company does not have tax and legal setup in the state you work in... it can take a great deal of time for them to ""hire"" you remote. 
* Remember to exercise patience in the process. If you really really need a job Remote work seems to be TWICE as long to get on boarded as in office jobs. So if you need a job don't insist on remote work... it would be a waste of everyone's time.

Cheers"

Summary of Emma Goldberg's 'research':

\- Remote workers say they love flexibility but are actually ""confused"" by hybrid work schedules and need routine. They're feeling ""stressed, uncertain, and anxious"" and are in a ""malaise."" She cites a stat about 40% of workers being unhappy with their jobs. (Couldn't possibly be because of wages and cost of living? How much of that 40% don't \*have\* flexible schedules?)

\- Working from home makes workers feel like cogs in a machine.

\- Remote workers are less able to network or advance in their careers, and are missing out on ideas, feedback, and bonding.

\- Workers need to be more ""excited"" about going to the office, which will happen by having things like exercise classes and more happy hours.

\- She loved visiting a cereal factory where they designed the office AS A CEREAL BOX full of neon colored furniture and fake plants, and that she would live there."

"Hi guys,  


I have a full-time job in Dubai and currently in talks with a company for a fully remote role in Dubai. Since the company size is small, I don't want to take the risk of switching from my current company. Is it possible to hold the second remote job while working the first one? I'd like to see how it pans out for 3-6 months down the lane to get a feel for the new company's culture and then switch full time.  


With remote jobs becoming more a trend, this would have been doable outside of Dubai but not sure how to work around the visa situation for this"
"I have applied for so many remote jobs (mainly through Indeed) and I have not heard back from any of them, I have probably applied for 50-ish just in the last week.

"UPDATE!!!  Just talked to HR and they will NOT be adjusting my compensation when we move.  YAYYY!!

--

I started a new job in December, fully remote/WFH.  Entire company is remote/WFH.

I live in Upstate NY, an hour northwest of Albany, about halfway between Saratoga Springs NY and Bennington VT.

My salary is $70K per year pre-tax.

Due to my partner's job we are relocating to Chattanooga TN.  This has been in the works for a while and my company takes no issue with it (I will still be in the same time zone and the company is a registered entity in Tennessee - it's a registered entity in 47 out of 50 states).

My question is, do companies adjust compensation based on where you live?  The cost of living in Chattanooga is significantly lower than where I am now, even though I am literally in the boonies (I  live in a small village surrounded by farmland, the closest grocery store is 20 minutes away) and Chattanooga is an actual city, albeit a small one.

I know there's probably no hard and fast rule here as each company is different, but was curious to hear from anyone here who has relocated while in a WFH job if your company has adjusted your comp in any way.

Asking out of curiosity because it will affect our budget for how much we can afford to pay in rent if my yearly comp changes and I'm trying to plan ahead."

Most of my gigs have been local for a while now and I haven't had to do a lot of job searching in quite a few years, so I'm wondering where to even begin?

I've worked in IT in various roles for the past 15+ years of my life. My most recent role was a Sr Network Engineer but I consider myself mostly a Sysadmin / Netadmin / Level 3 tech.

"Or is it?  


Lately, there has been a lot of news mentioning the end of the remote work. Many big companies have issued statements forcing employees to return to the office.

The amount of remote job offers has declined. Is it time to go back to the ""normal"" working environment?

Those are all the comments you'll see floating around. But the reality is different.

  
Let me explain.

Yes, the amount of job listings for remote positions has declined compared to the COVID era. Why?  
During COVID lockdowns, the companies were forced to operate remotely! It wasn't a natural growth of the remote job market. 

*It was a forced anomaly! A Spike!*

As they had no other option than to operate remotely, that's what they did. The executives and managers had to overcome their biases towards remote work. They had to learn to operate in this new situation.

But those companies have never been ""remote-friendly"" places in the first place. So now that they can have people back in the offices, that they spend crazy amounts of money on. They want you back in!

The pandemic era was an anomaly, a spike in remote markets, and we have to see it as such. It wasn't an organic growth and adaptation of WFH practices. Just an anomaly.

&#x200B;

Going back to the current state of the remote job market.

If we compare the data from the pre-pandemic level to now, [the amount of remote jobs is much higher.](https://remotedom.com) But also, the interest and desire for remote-friendly positions is growing massively.

The pandemic has done a lot of good for the remote job market. Before, most people have experienced the benefits and freedom of working remotely. It also tore down a lot of biases and misconceptions about working remotely.

Is remote work dying? No, it's actually growing!

More companies are remote-first, not just remote-friendly. The managers are looking favorably at remote hiring. It saves costs and improves employee satisfaction.

A win-win for all."
Hello I am looking for remote job I live in Illinois and can't find anything online. I have chronic illness and need work from home. Anyone know any places hiring?
"Just looking for advice. I was recently presented with the opportunity to work remotely on a 3 year contrac full time as a contractor. It is very flexible, as in no meeting, get my work done whenever, only quarterly in person meetings. No pension, benefits, vacation, sick days, or tax deductions. I would make approx 5,000 less than what I made now. 

I work a busy job, Monday to Friday in a toxic workplace. I am due for a raise in a few months, have pension, benefits, 25 vac days, and paid sick days. Due to being in a isolated community, I would be unable to find anything similar locally. 

My personal life is stable, own a home, have kids, loving spouse, etc. I'm also taking a degree program online and should be complete by June, I could hold off and complete this at a slower pace if needed. 

I am excited for the new opportunity, but nervous about leaving the stability of my current job. I am debating doing both. Does anyone have any words of wisdom for me? Advice what to do from people who work remotely."
" 

Since graduating high school, I have always wanted to work remotely from home - preferably with a flexible schedule - to earn some decent income and assist my aging parents. I live in a small rural town that offers very little in terms of job growth or sufficient income that could help my parents pay their bills. All jobs in my area are minimum wage(I live in Washington State, so the minimum wage as of this current date is $15.74,) And with the cost of living rising,(not to mention it being exacerbated by current inflation) my parents struggle more each day.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, I tried starting my own Amazon(arbitrage) business. Retail arbitrage was a bust, so I went with FBA, only to learn that the market was too overly saturated with competition, and the seller fees made it nearly impossible to earn a profit(not to mention too many item category restrictions.) I tried dozens of online programs, videos, and tips to make it work, but to no avail. I put two years of hard work into Amazon, trying to create my own private-label brand with no success. Again, oversaturation. This venture cost me thousands of dollars with zero ROI.

Next, I tried flipping used valuable items on eBay, Mercari, and finally, Facebook marketplace for over a year by wasting hundreds of dollars on items and ads only to have a few sales a month. Mercari is a total bust, with current listings sitting on their site for over a year. I've made a few sales on eBay, but more people are on the E-commerce bandwagon more than ever. Compared to ten years ago, more sellers in today's market have really upped the competition. Most sales on eBay or Facebook marketplace consist of buyers throwing lowball offers at me-eg. A good-quality jacket listed for $150 is determined by comparing prices with other sellers or apps. A potential buyer comes at me with an offer saying, ""Will you take $25 for it instead?""

My last-ditched attempt at selling anything online was drop shipping. I put a lot of time and energy into drop shipping while I was simultaneously learning Amazon and then eBay arbitrage. I watched tons of YouTube videos on this and sought out the best marketing strategies, only to lose even more money.

Since I am unable to sell anything online, are there any other possible job opportunities out there that are not over-saturated? Maybe I can't run my own business at home, but are there any online opportunities that offer remote work with decent pay and don't require big college degrees? Is there anything online or at home that does not involve e-commerce? Any ideas would be really helpful. Thank you."
"Some interesting statistics from this [article](https://heyhowtodoit.com/remote-work-statistics/).

1. **Remote Work Statistics Before Covid** \- Before the pandemic, only 6% of the employed worked primarily from home and about three-quarters of workers had never worked from home.
2. **Remote Work Statistics After Covid** \- Overnight in March 2020, office occupancy plummeted from 100% to \~15%. On March 2023, national office occupancy hasn't recovered much. Occupancy sits at 50%.
3. In July 2022, LinkedIn data showed that paid remote jobs on LinkedIn (15.9%) attracted a majority of applications (52.9%) and nearly a majority of views (46.0%) compared to on-site jobs. The number of applications increased dramatically since data tracking began in January 2020, when 2.2% of remote jobs attracted 2.9% of applications.
4. There's a **fundamental disconnect** right now in work. **52% of workers are considering going remote or hybrid this year**. **Yet 50% of companies plan to require full-time in-person work.**
5. **50% of job applications** are for remote work, but **only 15% of job openings** offer flexible work."

"So here's my situation. I had been working remotely for almost 10 years. The last 5 years I've had serious back problems due to degenerated discs, like some days I'm not able to walk. I was able to manage it ok doing wfh, but even then sometimes it was really tough. 

Now, I'm laid off and have been applying for about the last two months, all to remote positions. Yesterday I see a hybrid job near me that seems like a very good fit. Listing says they require 2 days in office a week and tbh I think that would be difficult for me to manage. I think realistically I could do 2-4 days a month in office without having what quality of life I have left deteriorate further. 

I'd like to apply and at some point try and negotiate for full or mostly remote. My doctor has said he's willing to write me a note to vouch for me and from the job description it doesn't really seem like there's a real need to be in office that much. Has anyone done this or have any advice on the best ways to go about it? Like at what point in the process do I bring it up? (Assuming I even get an interview and all that...)

Thanks in advance. "
"Working remotely offers a unique and liberating experience that brings joy and flexibility to everyone though some still prefer an office setting. 

Looking at the freedom to work from anywhere is a game-changer for folks out there. Whether it's from the comfort of your home, a cozy coffee shop, or even while traveling the world, remote jobs grant the ability to design your own workspace. It could as a Social Miner with DAOLabs remotely earning online through Social Mining or as a remote marketer on ebay or Ali express simply making a good sale while sipping tea.

This flexibility allows for a better work-life balance, as you can spend more time with loved ones, pursue hobbies, and create a schedule that suits your needs."
"I work in the finance industry for a company that has a ""flexible work policy"" but everyone labels you as lazy or assume you are taking a holiday if you work from home. So I don't work from home unless I'm sick.

I have a chronic pain illness (endometriosis) and consequently, tired all the time. There isn't much help for people with my illness when it comes to extended sick leave or getting benefits to work less hours, so I'm considering remote work.

But, I'm worried that I it won't solve my problem of constant fatigue. I might just think that it will, and then find out it doesn't make a difference.

I'm an introvert, and I absolutely hate the noise level in my office and I'm not into the constant small talk. It's so much easier to focus at home and I can also deal with my symptoms. 

How have you found the transition from 100% office work to 100% remote? 
Has it lowered your stress levels? 
Do you feel you are less likely to experience burnout?"
"So, I'm currently employed as a part time school custodian. I'm getting to where I can't handle the job anymore, sometimes I can't even leave my house. I have a laundry list of psychiatric disabilities that make an in-person job very hard, such as depression and autism. I also don't drive a car and many jobs in my area require a drivers license. I haven't been at my current job very long and it's my first real job, so I would need jobs that don't require much experience. 

As for qualifications, I don't have a college degree but I graduated from high school with honors and I got a Microsoft Office Specialist certificate during my freshman year. I'm proficient in FL Studio, an audio software, as I have been producing music for 6 years. I'm well versed in many other computer programs as well. I'm most familiar with PowerPoint and Word, though I can use just about anything in the Microsoft or Google suites. I also like to write and I consider myself a decently good writer. I can write songs, essays, stories, pretty much anything. English is my native language, but I can read and write basic Spanish. Speaking it might be a stretch though. "

"About to move into a new location in two weeks and will need to utilize my hotspot for my WFH jobs. 

It will just be me in my studio apartment. Outside of working, I play video games and watch YouTube on my phone.

I've decided to get a Verizon Visible+ plan and dedicate its data towards work. I also have a TP-Link router with an Ethernet port and 4G/5G dongle to help get all of the speed I can out of my plan. 

I'm currently residing in a place with legitimate home Internet (Cox), but neither of my WFH jobs required a speed test report. One of them even gave me a rig that required a Wi-Fi dongle.

If I swap from Cox Wi-Fi setup to a Mobile Hotspot setup, will the companies notice anything on their end? It's not necessarily ""against the rules"" to be on a hotspot, but I hear it's frowned upon. So, I'd like to conceal that if possible.

"Just as the title says...I'm currently a nanny, but wanting to switch fields as I'm getting burnt out working for work from home parents. I'm also a part time college student. 

I'd love to find an entry-level data entry-type remote job. I have experience in the mortgage industry, and even though it's been about 10 years since I left, it wouldn't take much for me to relearn.  I'm smart, good with computers, and working on learning some programming languages, just not there yet. I struggle with being on the phone due to an auditory processing disorder, not saying I can't talk on the phone, I just can't make a living off of being on the phone. 

I'm in Colorado if that helps."
"I am working hybrid at my current company and I come in office 2 times a week. Our office has a hybrid work policy, but we also have employees working remote in other provinces (mostly engineer and devs). 

I don't mind the hybrid schedule, but I plan to move to another province next year and I want to negotiate remote work with my manager. Our team is small and everyone works hybrid. I am worried that if I ask for relocation I would lose this job because I am the only remote member in the team. Even though I got very positive feedback from management and colleagues about my performance, nothing is guaranteed. We do have members working remotely, but they do so as a whole team, and there are also some sales people who work remote. They have good track records and have been with the company for a few years.

Is my worry unnecessary? I am afraid that if I bring up the topic to my manager and they are not happy about it, it will be awkward moving forward. Another thing I can do is looking for another job as a back up and only bring up the topic if I am very close to a job offer, so that if the negotiation fails I still have another job.

What do you think I should do? I appreciate all your advice."
"Hello all, I am looking for a second stream of revenue to make use of my down time at home in the evenings and was curious as to what to look for or steer clear from regarding remote work.

"Hi everyone,

I'm in the running for a remote position and I'm wondering about what your work days look like?   I've heard people say that they are in their pajamas all day, don't take a shower if they don't want to, etc.  I'm wondering--can I really throw in a load of laundry?  Empty the dishwasher, foster kittens, walk on the treadmill, make dinner?  These are all things that I've heard from others are advantages but are they just blowing smoke or are these kinds of perks legit?"
"I am right out of university with a degree in Psychology. I hope to find a remote job that I can do anywhere as I have many chronic conditions and I have family in both canada and USA, my family member in the USA is sick as well.. and i would like to visit for large portions of the year if possible. 

my questions: 

Is this realistic to want as my first job? 

Where is a good website to look for these positions?

Is there Part time positions in this area? 

thanks :) Not afraid of hearing no as well, so if this is a bit of a far fetched dream don't hesitate to tell me. Just looking for a place to start. "
"It seems like every other post is someone saying they're being forced to RTO. I have less than 5 years in the IT field and from what Ive gathered, the only people still holding on to their remote jobs after the pandemic are people with 20+ years experience, in any field. Even these people are becoming less and less each day. I'd just like to get a job doing data entry at this point, I don't care about making less money, but is it realistic to keep applying for remote jobs or should I just suck it up and go back to working in person?"
"Hello there guys, currently looking for an international work position I'm from South America and I don't have a degree so it would be something like customer support...  
Do you know any company that hires for that position or similar? Of course bilingual or English only.

"Hello! I'm in need of some advice on upgrading my home workspace situation.

Recently, my boyfriend (34M) and I (28F) moved in together into a three-room apartment: our bedroom, a spacious room with natural light, and a smaller room without any natural light.

Since my boyfriend is self-employed and works from home full-time, he set up his own workspace in the room with natural light, with a standing desk, monitor, and office chair. Meanwhile, I've been making do with the dining room table in our living room, because I used to have a hybrid work situation and could go to an actual office.

But now I've transitioned to a fully remote position, and I need a more suitable workspace, with an office chair and a monitor. Whenever I use my boyfriend's office desk with a monitor when he's away, I find that I am way more productive, so I need to find a solution.

I've brainstormed three potential options, each with its own set of pros and cons, and I'd love to hear your thoughts:

1. **Living room setup:** Squeeze a small office desk and chair in the living room. This allows me to have a separate workspace, use a monitor and office chair, and still benefit from some natural light. However, the living room will feel very cluttered. It's an open-concept living room so it would be in the same space as the kitchen and TV.
2. **Small room conversion:** Transform the small room with no natural light (currently used for storage) into my office. While it provides a dedicated space, I'm worried that working 8+ hours a day in a cave with no natural light might impact my mood and circadian rhythm. My boyfriend actually tried to work from there once and hated it.
3. **Shared office space:** Set up a desk next to my boyfriend's in his office. The positives include having a separate office space, enjoying natural light, and keeping the rest of the apartment uncluttered. On the flip side, I'm unsure about working in the same room as my boyfriend. He doesn't have meetings, but he he doesn't like to use headphones so he plays audio often on speaker or does stretches in the middle of the room 

Important note: Adding a workspace to our bedroom impossible because there's no room, and it's also a room with no natural light.

I'd greatly appreciate any advice or personal experience working from home with a partner that also works from home. 

Thank you in advance!"
"I am looking for work and I feel like I am freaking out !

Somebody please help me.

I've applied at KellyConnect, no positions available for my city. --------------- many other places, \*shrug.

**Please, if someone happens to be a hiring manager, DM me now to hire me remotely or write underneath this comment.**

I'm in North Florida.

Have 11+ years in experience with a resume! I'm amazing at any very thing I do. As I would assume any (obvious) functioning person can. (sorry for the sarcasm, people don't seem to hire)

Please hire me, I need remote. I have 10 upload mbps and 39-100 download mbps internet speed. Can type 45 wpm.

I have a computer set, as it would be from a library with a webcam as well.

I gotta pay my bills and am desperate for any remote job. I've been in customer service for who knows how long. I'm amazing at this stuff. In fact, I'm always so great, customers, employees - especially the new ones, think I'm the manager or at least speak to me as if I am and is surprise, at times, when I say I'm not.

Customer Representative (remotely), as I have to be home. Pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I currently have a remote position, but when I was hired the job was never listed as remote and I was always under the impression that I'd work out of an office. On the last day the hiring manager just mentioned in passing that a lot of the team occasionally works from home. This happened pre-covid.

Does these scenarios still exist? Are job announcements not listing remote positions when they in fact are remote? I'm considering a move and obviously would prefer to be remote."

"Hey guys, so i've been looking for remote work since July 2022 and haven't found anything. I had 1 round of interviews last month for a BDR opportunity but never proceeded to the 2nd round of interviews.

Im really starting to lose hope. I've applied to:

Data entry
SDR/BDR
Customer service
Technical support

NOTHING.

What can I do? I really need help as i don't have reliable transportation and remote work would be the most feasible option right now.

For context, i'm currently doing college online pursuing an A.S in information technology. I hav sales experience from life insurance but quit because i ran out of money for leads & made $0 commissions & have some UX design skills. I'm good on the phone too."

I'd truly value your input. Feel free to share right here or send me a direct message. Thank you much! - Lia"

Walks during the day and park trips. 
It makes for late nights but at least I get to be present

"I don't mind being on the phone I don't mind taking inbound calls, customer service, or doing technical support. I'm just trying to find a remote work from home job in that field. Most of the time when I'm looking on indeed most of the remote jobs involve some form of telemarketing or calling customers and only getting paid on customers you call and they sign up. I'm looking for the opposite of that where I'm doing inbound calling or customer service or technical support retention or something similar, if anyone has any ideas or options, please steer me in the right direction."
"In the face of the current layoff trends, the emergence of AI, and the shift back to office-centric work, I'm hoping to find guidance in this community. Is it possible to find a remote native iOS development job while based in Thailand? Additionally, how do I go about finding companies or projects that are open to having a developer located in this region? I understand the stereotype that developers in Thailand might lean towards a 'sabai-sabai' lifestyle, focusing more on leisure than work.

Here's a bit about my background, which might be helpful for specific advice:

1. **Experience**: With 11 years of expertise in native iOS development, hope I am well beyond a junior level (of course in some companies as FAANG I would be a junior level).
2. **Citizenship**: Ukrainian. Not seeking empathy, but rather providing context as I am not from the typically represented demographics on Reddit such as the U.S., Canada, or Australia. Due to the terrible situation in Ukraine and the poor state of the IT labor market (30-50 iOS positions including all levels in Ukraine), working in my home country is not possible. Additionally, my professional network hasn't been particularly helpful.
3. **Previous Remote Work**: My past experience includes direct remote work for a U.S. company before COVID. Unfortunately, this ended due to my location in Ukraine and my inability to leave country at that time when full scale war started.

I'm looking for advice on:

1. Are there realistic opportunities for remote iOS development roles while residing in Thailand?
2. Which companies should I consider approaching, perhaps those in Australia for time zone compatibility? What platforms or communities could be instrumental in my search? A friend of mine works with customers from Australia, they do not care about his location and even OK to pay salary in crypto, but they do not need mobile.
3. Are there any expatriate developer communities in Thailand that might offer advice or assistance?
4. Any specific tips for finding mobile development roles? I've observed that opportunities in mobile development are predominantly found in the United States, with some presence in European countries like Germany and Spain.

I'm also aware that even in the U.S., the job market is challenging now, even for FAANG developers with green cards/passport who have more experience than I do."
"Starting a remote work or job comes with a whole lot of benefit and experience. The goal is to utilize the opportunities and turn them into productive outcomes. But there's a bone of contention that one may ponder on! Are remote jobs impacting lives in the world today or office jobs?

Many experiences are being shared on the internet today. Aside from the reviews on Trustpilot, we can see how YouTube carries lots of influencers who advertise different remote jobs some are real while others are false. The impact here false on the influencers and content creators alone.

Only few major ones stands out, through organizations that either empowers platforms or constantly provides job offers that can actually impact lives, including freelance jobs, Social Mining jobs, LinkedIn posts and Remote co. These organization provides real remote jobs with payment proofs and somewhat satisfaction from those who engage in them.

Whereas office jobs and the recent layoffs happening globally definitely will cause some pain for those who never planned for it. Though a little impact is seen with companies that are still offering job openings."
"I am a 19F with no work experience, not even working in a fast food joint, cafe, or bubble tea place. I don't even have no unpaid intern experience. I have no drivers license so I cannot do delivery and cannot work at a convenience store because there might be crazy people who buy alcohol at night possibly holding a knife in their hand. So I was wondering what kind of remote job I can do with my circumstances? 

&#x200B;

I was thinking maybe about getting a remote job in data entry administration or teaching foreign languages on platforms like Cambly or Preply. How much would I be able to earn working there? Also I am a full time student so I would not be able to work full time doing tutoring, and what can I do to ask for a higher pricing so I can work for less hours. I also want a remote job that I could do while commuting, because I cannot afford to pay rent to an off campus apartment and I have to inevitably commute from my parents' home. 

&#x200B;

Please give me good advice ..."

"I recently graduated with a Kinesiology degree. I have no interest in going back to school, I originally wanted to go to PT school because when I had to choose a degree at 17 years old the only thing I knew I was passionate about was sports and PT. Despite my degree in Kinesiology I have grown a passion for marketing and travel and social media etc. I had a remote internship (no longer hiring) and was able to travel to Costa Rica with my gf all summer. I also did Marketing internships here working for a startup creating social media content as well as other hospitality companies making content for them. I also have a travel tiktok with over 100K followers which may help on my resume? But after I graduated I absolutely can not find a job anywhere. Right now my main goal is to land a remote job, or start something I can do from my computer because I have no interest in going into an office everyday for the rest of my life. I want a remote job or an adventurous job so that I can travel and see the world while im young and also make a living. I was wondering if any one has any advice for me? I've been applying since beginning of may and only have received 1 interview which I didnt get which was in remote sales. I just feel like I have no guidance on where to start applying or what entry level remote jobs I can get despite my degree. Thanks so much!"
"Last year I took a break from working in corporate after my manager wanted me to come in to 'network' even though the company was still following the covid guidelines and there were no people in the office - I was literally one of like 5 people in the whole 2 story building. On top of that, I was the only one in my team and the teams we frequently worked with that was based in my country, so I felt like she was just making things difficult for me. I also moved to another city during covid and worked for that same company for 2 years, fully remotely with no issues - my previous manager knew about this and was totally ok with this and that was a big reason for my move.
I decided to take some time off to just live a little and resigned. I initially wanted like a half a year break to explore my hobbies and travel, given that I had enough savings to do this comfortably. There were a lot of remote, HR jobs on the market and I have about 5 years of experience in the field so I felt like it would be quite easy to land a new job. 
I have been applying to so many remote listings for 3 months now and every offer I got contacted about turned out to be hybrid work, requiring me to relocate. I am not down to do that but I am getting to the bottom of my savings and starting to get really stressed out about this. 
Do you have any recommendations on what to do? I really feel like such a failure because it's just not looking like anything will change. I am applying for office jobs in my area but there aren't a lot of corporations here unfortunately."
"In the Spring of 2021 is when I started my first remote job. Previously to that, I was working in medical records at an eye clinic but it was not a great job. The work environment was very stressful and not what I wanted to do long term.

One of my good friends had told me about her work from home job at an up and coming real estate company. She said it was one of the best jobs she had ever had. I thought it was too good to be true. She invited me to observe her as she showed me what she did in a day. I immediately wanted the job.

Fast forward about 6 months later and applying at this company 3 times, I had finally landed the job! It took networking, persistently reaching out to recruiters and managers, applying to many positions, etc. but I finally got my foot in the door. I had to work through my insecurities and self doubt every time I got rejected but I couldn't give up. This is what I wanted.

Now 2 years later I am enjoying my life beyond what I could imagine. I genuinely love the work I do, I have more free time for myself and others, and I have more free time to invest into others and help them make their work from home dreams a reality.

If finding a remote job is your dream I have advice for you:

Don't give up
Keep learning new skills and update your resume constantly
Network and make real connections
Keep your eye on the prize

"My maternity leave ended last month and I was able to live off my taxes for a little but I'm going back to work this week and kind of dreading it. My cat just got diagnosed with cancer too so the stress of home life is gonna be on my mind when I go to work  do y'all have any suggestions for finding remote work asap? I've been looking for the past month and it's always something commission only, ramp up period this, pyramid scheme that. I need some guidance  

Edit: There's childcare lined up. This is my first time with a baby and my first time looking for work in over 4 years so I'm a little rusty but I have 4 years experience as a receptionist and data entry and work in catering sales now.
Also I just wanted input from other moms that are trying or are looking, thank you to the person that pointed me to the correct forum. "
"I'm in a bad position, I need to work from home. Would making a fake resume be wise if I want to get a job quickly? I have no customer experience besides customer service at McDonald's."
"So I applied to a remote position that had no info re: being in office or travel. Had three interviews and no mention of being in office or travel. I received my offer which states I'm a remote employee and for reporting purposes only roles up to X office which is several states away from my home and is a 90 mile, 2.5-3 hr drive one way away.

On my fourth day I was told I needed to go to the office for ""face time"" with a SVP who was stopping in. I felt like it was being told and not asked of me so I went.. left my house at 6:20am got there 9:20am and stayed all day and for a dinner after. Didn't hit the road until 8:30pm and didn't get home until 10:30pm. I was falling asleep at the wheel.

Next day my boss asked me how it was and that there's a lunch the following Wed I should go to. This is where I decide to align expectations. I shared that I didn't feel safe making a 5+ hr round trip to the office and thatI applied to a remote role, my offer says I'm remote and we never discussed any requirement re: being in office. He asks me if I can go in 10%. I ask what does that mean exactly and he says every 6-8 weeks. I said no I can't commit to that. I can do once a quarter and will require a company paid hotel. We settled on this and I have it in writing.

This whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I shared that if the job description or in any of my interviews noted a requirement to be at the office at any given time it would have impacted my decision. I'm new and want to be a good team member but I also want to set boundaries based on what was agreed upon when I applied and accepted.

There's a lunch this Wed and it's now ""optional"" but I'm making myself crazy over if I should go or not. I feel like if I go they will keep asking to go in but if I stand my ground then I'm enforcing the boundary and expectations.

What are your thoughts on the situation? Am I right to be turned off by this? Do I now have a target on my back? Do I move on and follow the boundary I set and not think about it because it's settled?

PS - He also said traveling in should be easy because I don't have kids... major red flag and documented.

Edit:
Didn't go to the ""optional"" lunch and boss seemed to be fine with it. I have feelers out just in case as back up, but hoping this is all going to be a nonissue. I've already received great feedback from him and the team on how I'm doing so I think if I stay the course I'll be as ""ok"" as one can be at any job in the US :)"
"Currently looking for a new job working from europe, and noticing US companies list full remote positions - or even sometimes freelance needs - but accept only local candidates.

Is there a reason for this? Trying to figure out if it's a quirk most companies have, or if it's a more widespread requirement that I should have in mind and change my sights somewhere else.

Thanks"

"Hi, I'm an architect with long experience. I live in cairo and currently between jobs. I'm looking for short term remote work I can do from home till I start working again. I'm bilingual (English & Arabic) with good communication skills, and I've worked remotely before. I'm not looking specifically for work in my field but I don't want to fall into scams, where can I find legit work? And what can I do remotely? Thank you in advance."
" 

I am working in a Remote role as a manager in FP&A. The president sent an email offering voluntary severance opportunities before involuntary layoffs happen. Most likely January is when the involuntary layoffs happen. It seems like they are going to slash jobs across the board just because we didn't attract enough income this year and we grew too fast. We found out that my department alone could face up to 20-30% cuts soon enough.

This job even while being 100% Remote has been exceptionally stressful and it's taken a mental and physical toll on me. A lot of others I work with have also been feeling this stress and overcapacity. Potentially getting laid off might feel like a big stress has been lifted but then I am stressing about losing a 100% remote job.

I have been constantly applying for jobs and have been doing so the past few months but I have not getting any hits so far except 1 interview for a hybrid (very high COL) position. Just wanted to vent a little. I don't know what I am going to do. The job market is going to take time to recover before I start seeing more interviews."
"I recently took a contract position in my field. It was a huge mistake I will never make again. I could only bill for 40 hours, but I worked 75. The pay was good, and it was fully remote. Shit contract, though. 

I took the position to escape a horrible boss, under which I was a permanent employee. Silent, in person office (enforced by constant monitoring), lots of public screaming at top employees no matter their numbers (I was a top performer and his main target). People literally quit over my treatment that they themselves never received. It was that bad. 

Working at home, over a 3 month period, I feel like I've fried my circuitry. Like my cortisol level is at 11 and now I can't dial it down. I can't sleep. After a week of ""rest"", I can barely look at a computer screen and I still feel fucking nuts. 

It's getting better, but at a snail's pace. Is this from working at home? Did I leave myself no escape from work? Is it my inability to read prospective bosses as I read prospective candidates? 

Is this common to anyone else? Lastly, what can I do to just feel normal (WTF that means, lol). I don't mind the hours, but I've never experienced this feeling working anywhere else. Is remote work bad for some? Or is it just me?"
"Here's the thing, I don't really have many - and that's the main problem. 

I started remote work answering calls for $9/hour for infomercials and random inbound calls for data breaches with people inquiring about signing up for credit monitoring. I absolutely hated it. 8 hour shifts with elderly mostly calling who had no technical experience or people mad they were getting a letter in the mail for something they had no idea what it was. 

I changed jobs a little over 2 years ago to dispatching and casework for another company and I've been pretty successful there. Granted it's a 1099 position. I always get props for my high QM scores but never really get anything for it. Currently I make $14/hour BUT everyone's hours were recently reduced to 30 hours, in my case, or 25 hours, in lower tier agent's case, a week. It's NOT sustainable. I've ran through my savings to cover bills, all while management keeps dangling a carrot over our heads saying 'hours should pick up soon'.

I *need* something better. 

The issue is, I can't seem to find anything. It's all either scams, or I get rejected or I just do not hear anything back - OR just something happens and my interview all the sudden doesn't exist, which has happened twice now by different companies. 

I did test the water at a start up company but their structure was so terrible that I quit within 3 days because they weren't training me, even though I was asking almost hourly for more training material or sessions. That was a terrible experience because I had to miss my current job for a few days to actually do this one because they didn't read I needed a few days to start so I could fix my schedule. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Remote work is my only option due to medical issues, immune system can't handle a normal job. 

I've dressed my resume up so much, went over it with a professional back in June last year and they agreed that it was great, even went back with a different person and they agreed but changed a few details. All-in-all I don't think it's my resume that's the problem. 

What should I do? I feel so stuck."
"I need a little help presenting a case. So I work remotely, thankfully, but my company has pretty strict policies on leaving your city. I really want to move to Spain. I love my job and I don't want to sacrifice it. I know that I can get special permission to reside somewhere else or to be outside of the country for more than four weeks. However, it has to go through HR and management. One thing that I know that might prevent them from considering my request is that I have a company phone and I doubt they'll want to go through the hassle of paying international calls, even if I offer to pay for them myself. My industry is also lawn care, so I'm not sure how my move would benefit the company. What kind of a proposal or argument could I use here to hopefully sway them in my favor?"
"TLDR

*	36% of remote workers would quit or look for a new job if required to return to the office.
	*	58% are likely to seek remote positions for their next job.
	*	The value placed on the flexibility to work from anywhere increased from 29% in 2020 to 38% in 2023.
	*	25% of remote workers consider schedule flexibility the top perk, a decrease from 31% in 2020.
	*	Time with family as a perk has more than doubled in importance between 2020 and 2023

"I'm currently in a pretty tight bind financially speaking while working at a large tech chain but it's just not doing enough since they put me from full time to part time. About a year ago I also had my car get totalled and haven't been able to save, or get a loan for a new one so I'm stuck in the house a LOT and given my location a remote job would be the best option. However I don't have much experience besides fast food, retail, customer service and one professional instance of running a screen-printing shop so I was wondering if anyone had leads on job types or jobs that will take someone with little experience like myself? I'm not looking for something that pays crazy or anything, just something that might allow me to get a bit of a hand up if possible."
"I currently work full-time for a large company in California with bases all over the state. I have wanted to move to Oregon for years, but things have always gotten in the way. I am finally finding myself completely capable of moving out there, the only issue is my job. I adore my job, I am 100% remote, am great at what i do, do something that is expensive for the company to replace, and my boss is fully supportive of trying to get me where I would be happiest.

Unfortunately, my companies handbook states no out of state employees, presumably for labor law/tax conflicts. I will admit, I am not fully aware of how this request would *truly* impact HR. I am in finance and work on a lot of payroll, but I don't see THAT side of things. I have read a ton about the implications it can cause a business, but I have also met so many people (not from my company) that work without a pre existing base out of that state, so I am not positive on how it all works.

I have read about some people successfully convincing their company to let them move, since the other state has less intense labor laws (which would be the same in my case since I am coming FROM California) OR convincing their company to re-hire them through a staffing agency based in the state they're moving to. Obviously there are implications with that and it still requires work for HR, but it is worth noting my company already uses a specific staffing agency (which operates all around the US, not just California) to hire people all of the time. If you have any ideas or experience about this though, I'd love to hear.

I have not directly asked HR yet, so my question(s) is basically if you had experience in this, how did it go? OR if you understand more of the complexities of how this impacts HR, I'd love to learn so that I can draft a thorough appeal to them. I have a million ""emotional"" reasons to convince them, but I know that is far from important to a business, so I really want to meet them where they're at to hopefully elicit a better response. I am honestly desperate to move, but with the current job market and truly loving my job, leaving is not something I want to even think about right now.

Thank you!"
"Hello guys ! 

With a friend, we created LamaStay, a platform for **home swapping among remote workers**. For now, we're focusing on **Paris & Barcelona only**, but the idea is to go much further together. 

It's totally free for the launch  [https://lama-stay.com/](https://lama-stay.com/)

"Is it possible to work remotely from another country? From what I'm seeing, work mostly needed to be in the same country or states even if it is remote. I am from SEA and looking for a Software/Mobile developer jobs but so far most jobs need to be in their country to work."
"Not sure if this is okay but I desperately need recommendations: I'm in my last semester of college (part time too), and my job was working as my grandmothers caregiver (Medicaid apparently does that) , her health has reached the point where she needs more than one overworked college student taking care of her so she's going into an assisted living thing. 

And hense, I am in a position where I need a job. I need it now. And don't know where to look.

"Wondering if anyone has experience working remotely for Mueller Reports in their quality assurance department? I'm desperate to get a legitimate remote position, even willing to take a pay cut to do so, and I believe this is my first opportunity. I've read reviews from former employees on Indeed and they are so mixed that I'm just more uncertain than ever. I'll be leaving a good paying position with great benefits for the trade-off of working from home. If anyone has experience with this company, I'd love to hear about it before I make a final decision. Thanks in advance!"

"Hi Reddit people, I hope this post is appropriate for this subreddit.
I have a PhD in Chemistry, but have been working in a big Corporate as Engineer (started as Process Eng, then moved to Regulatory). Honestly I think I had enough. I make good money and work mostly from home (I know, I know...) but I am tired of the big Corporate BS and politics and tired of this job. I can settle for less money (or a lot less) but would like to do something different, on my own time (less than 40 hours per week would be ideal) and preferably remote. 
I have also experience with ISO9001, project management, Lean, I speak a second language and love Chemistry and Science in general. I also love cooking, baking and the science behind cooking. I am good with numbers and actually enjoy (!) doing paperwork and even my own taxes.
Any idea? TIA."
"I've been working remotely for the past 9 months and since this is my first remote job, I went about it like an office job. 

I turned my extra bedroom into an office and follow my working hours to a T, not leaving the office during work times except for my lunch break. The problem is my hours are long and I'm getting frustrated with the monotony of sitting in a room for 9+ hours a day.

Other remote workers, what do you do to overcome this? Do you switch rooms you work from, for a change? Do you have any tips and tricks to share? Everyone raves about 100% remote work but I'm finding it a little boring and lonely if I'm honest!

Any advice would be much appreciated!"

"Working from home has its perks, no doubt. No commute, flexible hours, and the freedom to work in your PJs. But let's face it, it can also get pretty lonely. The lack of face-to-face interaction can sometimes make us feel isolated. So, how do we combat this loneliness? Here are some tried-and-true strategies:

**1. Daily 20-Minute Team Meetings**

Start your day with a quick 20-minute team meeting. This isn't for discussing work-related issues, but rather a chance to share what you're planning to do for the day, any interesting news, or even what you had for breakfast! It's a great way to maintain a sense of camaraderie and keep the team spirit alive.

**2. Connect with Peers**

Find a couple of people in similar roles and set up monthly meetings with them. This can be a great way to share experiences, discuss challenges, and learn from each other. Plus, it's always nice to connect with people who ""get"" what you're going through.

**3. Get a Coach**

Consider getting a coach to help you navigate the challenges of remote work. A coach can provide guidance, support, and a listening ear when things get tough. Apps like **wave.ai** offer coaching services tailored to your needs. They can also help you with things like salary negotiation or career crossovers.

**4. Weekly Game Session**

Organize a weekly 30-minute game session with your team. This could be anything from online games like **Garticphone** or **Kahoot**, to virtual yoga sessions, or even a cooking challenge. It's a fun way to break the monotony and foster team bonding.

**5. Create a Cozy Workspace**

Make your workspace a place you love. Add some plants, pictures, or anything that makes you happy. A cozy workspace can make your workday more enjoyable and less lonely.

**6. Take Regular Breaks**

Don't forget to take regular breaks. Step away from your desk, make a cup of tea, or take a short walk. It's important for your mental health and can make your workday feel less isolating.

**7. Stay Active **

Exercise is a great mood booster. Try to incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine. It could be a morning jog, a midday yoga session, or an evening dance party in your living room!

It's normal to feel lonely when working remotely. But with these strategies, you can combat the loneliness and make your work-from-home experience a positive one.

Any other tips you follow?"

"I recently started a new job that is fully remote. Before that, I worked fully remote for a few years but my contract was technically as hybrid model, then Covid hit and the 20 days turned into a fully remote job.

I had to get a permission from security every time I wanted to work outside of my designated remote location for safety reasons (it was a bank). Because of that, I have never considered going on vacation and working from the hotel during the day.

In my new job, I no longer have that limitation and would love to plan a skiing trip in the winter. I was thinking of going there for a week or so and working during the day, which would be perfect for hitting the slopes for the evening run. 

Does anyone have experience with this sort of idea? What worked/didn't, what stopped you if you didn't go? 

Any advice would be appreciated!"
"Hello, everyone. I hope you're having an awesome day. I've got myself in quite the situation here, and I'd appreciate any advice you could give. Alright, so, I am an ex-pro tennis player, 18-years-old (F) Canadian Citizen currently residing abroad in Kyiv, Ukraine; I was born here. My Canadian father decided that he would kick me out of the house because of some problems he was having with my mother. He did not give me any money or a place to stay and refuses to help, which is fine with me. I am currently staying with my Ukrainian grandmother and searching for work here; my level of Ukrainian/Russian is B2 at best. Are there any ways I can work from abroad but find remote jobs in Canada? Are there any headhunting agencies that I should contact or job sites? I'd appreciate any help. Thank you.

P.S, I don't have the money to return to Canada right now and I'd prefer not to call the Embassy asking for a loan."
"Dear Remote Workers, 

I am an Italian expat living in another European country since almost 7 years now, and my girlfriend and I have made the decision to move back to Italy. 
My girlfriend is already fully remote, and can work from everywhere in the world.

Before I explain my situation further I would like to say this: my employer currently has employees working remotely from Italy, France, Romania and other countries around the world. The only people not allowed to work remotely are the ones living close to a city where they do actually have an office, and this is the situation I'm currently in. Absolutely stupid. Anyway, back to the story. 

We have decided to move back to Italy simply because I don't like it here and I am not happy. Weather sucks, my social life sucks, and everything is very expensive. Notice I say ""I"" as my girlfriend is ok staying here where we are, but she's absolutely down with moving to Italy. 

Our decision is a non negotiable, meaning we are going to move even if my employer says no. I just need to find a remote job and it might take some more time. However the simplest route would be having my employer agreeing with me working from Italy.

I would kindly need some advice from you on how to approach this with my manager, and then eventually with HR. My job can be done completely remotely, so no issues on that front. 

Do I give my manager/employer an ultimatum, saying I am moving back to Italy no matter what? Or do I ask nicely? I'm of the opinion that forcing their hand will give me more results, but I might be wrong. 

What are some things I can say to them to help my case? How can I best prepare for the meeting, and how should I schedule the meeting?

Thank you in advance for your help."
"I'm looking for a 100% remote work from home job with the follow criteria...

-100 percent remote. No driving to work required.
-No hardwired internet. It can be Wi-Fi or wireless Internet.
-No talking to other people vocally. (I have experience in that, but I absolutely despise it.)
-Pays at least $13-$18 USD per hour.
-Can schedule my own days, and put on my own set routine.
-No requiring other equipment, like another screen. (Even though I do have another screen.)

I am good with customer service, and have at least 9 years of customer service experience, with 3 years of experience working from home.
However, it would be great if I don't have to speak to anyone; but can email or do like a remote chat thing. 

I can type 40 WPM, and while this isn't exactly a ""quality"", I am almost always able to show up to work on time.

If anyone has any suggestions, please leave them in the comments.
But please be nice about it. And no spamming with pyramid schemes.
Only legit and nice responses."
"Hello everybody,

Straight to the point - additional inormation:

* Job ad stated: preferably from Luxembourg but flexible

* Interviewer expressed some degree of flexibility but I didn't try to dig deeper into the subject as it was my first interview. I mentioned however, that'd I'd love to be based in Portugal. This being said, I have also moved on to the next round of interviews 

* The company has offices in Luxembourg, Paris and London

* I have spoken to a friend that's using Remote.com to work for a Swedish company while working in Portugal and works great. He pays taxes in Portugal accordingly. Would this work with Luxembourg-Portugal?

* What other options are there? I don't really understand the being hired as a ""contractor"" or ""external consultant"" concepts (i.e. independent worker by establishing a company in Portugal). 

Happy to get insights on this!

Thank you community!"
"I am currently a J1 student in United States. I would like to work remotely from home for an IT company in the US. What kind of visa is required, is indeed.com a good site to find this kind of job, and do I need to worry about something?

"About six months ago I got my first full-time job and I was so excited. It was definitely a step up from my last job, which was contract work and underpaid. I love my new job and I was so happy. However, a few months in I started having severe GERD, irregular and painful bowel movements, etc etc (don't wanna gross y'all out too much). Ended up finding I have esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, and a hiatal hernia. Medications I've been taking do not help and my stomach seems to reject any food I eat, so I'm still on my GI journey. I have a very physically demanding job working 1:1 with children on the spectrum, can't take bathroom breaks when I need, and lots of movement makes me very nauseous. I used up my PTO before I realized I qualified for FMLA, and since then my health continues to decline and I have been out more and more. Of course, FMLA is supposed to protect me, but I know that in my state I cannot continue to work there and plan to leave at the end of the year bc I feel I'm a burden to them as I am. So until then, I am looking for remote work that will allow me to take care of my health needs while I work from home. Since I have been an RBT/ behavioral technician for many years, I feel a job around data or even just writing would fit me well. If anyone has suggestions on here, that would be much appreciated.

TLDR: My health is barring me from successfully being able to do my job, so I plan to change to remote work bc of the severity and need help/direction as I have never worked remote."
"I've recently taken a job working from home. I will be on the computer the majority of the day and taking phone calls. It's for a corporate job. I have a phone call with them tomorrow.

"On April 1st, I started my first fully remote job, and I thought to share some tips that helped me adapt quickly and be productive. I hope someone who wishes to work fully remotely will find this post helpful.

**Build a routine & dress up**

For years, my routine revolved around commuting to the office. It was easier to stick to it because of external ""urgency."" Now, I have to make a conscious effort to maintain my own work-at-home routine. I am glad I'm doing it, as it gives rhythm to my day and helps me get started at work.

Here's my daily routine: waking up - drinking a glass of water - exercising - meditating - having breakfast - showering - dressing up, and getting started at work.

Dressing up gives me a demeanor and a sense of professionalism which I appreciate.

**Ergonomic chair and standing desk**

When I started my new job, I was concerned about my posture and ergonomics. So I invested in a good chair and standing desk (as those things tend to be expensive, ask your company to help you with the purchase). I placed the desk close to a window to have some natural light. When I am done with work, I try to leave my desk neat and clear for the next day.

**Have a work-at-home journal**

As I was concerned about my well-being, I kept a work-at-home journal for a while. In the morning, I wrote my concerns, wishes, and intentions for the day; I would reflect on the day when closing work. The journal helped me to channel my thoughts, dump my worries, and address issues at work more calmly.

**Be aware of loneliness**

Working from home all day in a foreign city could be alienating (I am an Italian living in The Netherlands). I started feeling very lonely during my work days, so I made a list of activities to defeat loneliness:

* Plan virtual coffees with my colleagues
* Go to a co-working/coffee place to work
* Have a lunch break with a friend
* Plan after-work activities with other people (Meet-ups are a great solution)
* Invite a friend to work at your place
* Offer your neighbor to do pet sitting

**Make the best out of your breaks**

I usually chatted with a colleague at the office or headed to the coffee machine. At home, my breaks are a bit different. I want to stay away from my phone, so I list some nice things I could do during breaks.

* stretch, drink water, look at the distance
* do small house chores
* water and vaporize the plants
* pet the pet :)
* lay down and read 5 minutes
* do squats and abs
* Prepare a tea or a coffee
* walk outside
* play the guitar

**Stay focused and productive: plan, track and manage time**

When I am alone at my desk, it could be tempting to have distractions and mess around with social media, youtube, and news. I like to plan my week and adjust my next day's agenda the evening before. I do time boxing in my Google calendar, then track how I spend time with the Timeular app (also because I work there).

Planning ahead, tracking time, and then comparing the arranged time with the actual work done was a panacea for my productivity. I've noticed that I was taking too long breaks, and the house chores were distracting me, so I started setting a timer whenever I took a break/start a house chore.

Plus, I've noticed that I tend to work more hours on Wednesdays than needed, so I started planning after-work activities away from my keyboard for that day.

**Travel and enjoy remote working**

When I started the new job, I did not want to mess up with time zones, distractions, and impediments that come with travel. But now that I am more confident with the role, I'll give myself permission to travel more, working from places I have wanted to visit for a long time like Barcelona, Turin, and Mallorca.

Overall, remote work is great for me as long as I don't feel too lonely. The benefits I've experienced with remote work are work and private life in balance, more time for myself in the morning, no stress commuting, improved productivity, and traveling experiences :)"
"I have been applying to remote jobs for over a year now. I've only had a few interviews, where I was not picked. What are they looking for??? I currently work from home as a content moderator but it does not pay the bills. I also have almost 10 years of customer service experience, as well as reception experience and teaching within early childhood education experience. Why am I not having any luck?!!"
"I currently work from home in a salaried corporate position that provides great benefits.  Prior to switching to WFH, I typically worked 50-60 hour weeks. I have found I am significantly more productive at home than I ever was in the office, especially considering I don't have to commute and I'm not getting dressed to full business attire everyday. As such,  I'm considering getting a second part-time remote job (10-20 hours/week) to create an income stream that I can use for investment opportunities.  Only real requirement is I need to have flexibility in when I work as my current job will always come first.  I've been in the corporate world for a while, so I have plenty of experience with business communication, creating presentations, project management, organization, planning, scheduling, MS Office, etc. It may not matter, but I also have a Masters degree and formal project management education.  I have a great IT setup that belongs to me, so technology limitations is not an issue.  Is anyone else currently doing something similar?  I'm looking both for ideas and any pros/cons from people who have worked like this."
"I work remotely, so often end up working from home, hardly getting out much. I'm looking for some nice cafes in London I can work from, to get out a bit more. But I'm not such a fan of all the smaller, slightly claustrophobic looking ones with the tables so close together and that often get very busy. 

Anyone know of any quieter and/or slightly larger cafes that are pleasant to sit and work with a laptop for a few hours?"
How there. I'm looking for work from home in payroll processing. Has anyone found this kind of work. Are there special search engines for this. Thanks in advance!
"I recently landed a remote live assistant role via a remote job listing website called Mychatjob.com that promises a steady $30 an hour for a 25-hour workweek. The opportunity came at the perfect time, as I've been contemplating a move to Thailand to concentrate on my budding online business.

With the pull of Thailand's lower living costs and vibrant culture, I'm eager to understand the practicalities. Can an income of roughly $750 a week from this role comfortably cover the bare necessities there? My aim isn't luxury; I just want a stable environment to propel my online venture forward without financial distress lurking in the shadows.

Additionally, if anyone has insights or experiences regarding visa extensions beyond the initial 90-day tourist visa, it'd be super helpful.

Your shared wisdom and first-hand accounts can truly guide my next steps. Immensely grateful for any input!"
"Hi! So thanks to my partner, I will be living half the year in the US and half the year in Switzerland. Is it possible to find a remote job where I can work in both places? I won't need a visa in either place. I'm legally able to work in the US, and I plan on getting citizenship via marriage in Switzerland. "
"I'm going to cut to the chase - I'm in an abusive environment and I'm trying to find remote work. I'm isolated, can't drive or commute, and I live 2 hours from 2 major cities near me. I got accepted for Section 8 out of state as well, but I won't be able to move without finding a job. I am a licensed travel agent. I wanted to get certified with a casualty license, but I lost my Social Security income a few days before I was going to get my casualty license. 


It's been 3 weeks since I lost my SS money, and I've been able to heal from the abuse, but I'm unable to uproot and move & I'm unable to commute. I've also been out of work for 5 months & have been rejected from dozens of jobs. I need a remote job that's hiring immediately, no experience required and no degree required (I didn't attend college). My only license is in travel, but to get my casualty license, I decided to work 2 jobs to afford the $200 for my second license. I overcame verbal, psychological & physical abuse - so I can overcome hardships in the workplace."
Hi everyone i am 25 I graduated(bscs)  in oct 2022  and been look jobs since then but job condition here is Pakistan are pretty bad most jobs are taken on the basis of favoritism or bribery so now i am am looking for remote jobs outside the country but i have no idea how where to finds remote jobs
"I am due to quit my job tomorrow where I have been for 12 years. I work a hybrid schedule 3 days a week with an average commute time of 3-4 hours a day. I've no doubt that office days will increase to 4 days which is not so fun. I earn well, and to be honest I have an easy ride in what I do. 

2 weeks ago I accepted a full time remote job, same career and same salary... but I'm having last minute am I doing the right thing doubt?!? Someone talk me down from this ledge."
"I am strongly considering a remote role but interested in some feedback from those currently working remotely, specifically related to the following, but honestly any input would be helpful!

1) the company I received an offer from is in a time zone 2 hours away.  They seem flexible to the hours I work, though overtime is required certain times of the year.

2) would you still find remote work beneficial if it increased your commute time?  I have 2 little kids in a daycare we love, but it is located near my office.  I would have to take them and pick them up every day (about 40 minutes driving, 60 minutes total round trip).  Our son has 1.5 years before school which would be closer to our house.  At that time I'd consider switching our daughter to a closer daycare/pre school.

For reference, the pay is ~10% more than my current role but does require more overtime so about the same hourly.  My current job is in office 5 days a week full professional dress.  I find this exhausting.

Thank you!"
Long story short I received a contract to hire  employment opportunity through a recruiter right before Covid happened(March 2020 and we went remote up until April 2022) I got in a car crash in March 2022 and they allowed me to work remote up until currently. (Yes only me) We have a big meeting next week in which execs are coming in & they want me to come in for the week but honestly I don't want to. The reason being is that I was supposed to be perm 3 months into my tenure and everytime I've brought it up they've said they didn't have it in their budget despite me getting 3 new team members along with no raise in pay at all but more work on my plate. My team is swamped with work and I'm agitated working from home much less going in & dealing with everyone and meeting these big shots.i have holidays off with no pay due to it being a contract role n I'm really just weighing out my options at this point . Thoughts ?

"Hi everyone! I received a fellowship that will take me to Mexico City for 10 months. My boyfriend wants to come with me and is trying to figure out his work plans. There are a handful of US companies with jobs in his industry hiring in Mexico City as well as US companies that offer remote work globally. Does anyone know if he would need a special visa/sponsorship to be able to work from Mexico? I've seen some people working remotely from Mexico on a 6-month visitor visa where they go back to the US for a short trip once it expires.

Hello im looking for appointment setters great potential and great commissions. Let me know if you're interested. Work from your laptop on your own hours.
"Looking for a 2nd/part time remote job. I had done transcription before for years so a typing or data entry job is fine for me. I have a full time job and will be splitting child custody; so I could have anywhere from 2-4 evenings per week that I could work for 3-4 hours at a time; maybe occasional weekend or morning time.  

I have seen typing jobs posted for $22-30 an hour and part time. I am okay with lower to mid of the scale (I used to be paid $31 for same work in 2009!) since it is just some supplemental income.  My goal is to clear at least $6500 a year to offset my Roth IRA contributions; but realistically closer to 10-12K to offset some household expenses as well. My goal would be somewhere around 300 gross per week. 

Is it reasonable to look for or expect the kind of flexibility to work 8-16 hours per week? "
"I love working remote, but i sometimes feel like I'm on an island...if my boss doesn't respond to my Slack, for example, I can only wait (I can't just ""pop in to his office"").

A lot of times what could be resolved faster by pulling everyone into a meeting ends up becomes several hours of 1:1s (and I feel like no one talks to each other so I have to repeat myself). Have a tough time uncovering office politics (I have no idea who is close with who, who is upset with who). It's a small, fast paced startup btw, and I don't have a team.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Before I Started**

Before I started working from home in sales, I worked for t-mobile for 3 years, and before that I worked with Sprint for 2 years before they merged into t-mobile. I had at that point 100% customer service experience, making 2.6k/m after tax + benefits. Honestly thought I was going to retire there. 2022 came around and t-mobile made a lot of changes that actually ended up hurting my bonuses I'd normally get from selling phones and adding lines. Dropped as low as 1.9k/m. To me, at that time, was was a big pay drop. A close friend of mine, got even more screwed with those changes. He went from making 3.3k/m down to 2.1k/m after the changes. It was rough but honestly, was prepared to keep working there. My friend, however, did not.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**How I Started**

My friend took all his PTO and took 4 weeks off. He hit me up 2 weeks after he ""left"" saying he got a job as a remote closer. After he received his first paycheck, which was around 10k, he quit t-mobile at the drop of a hat. He went through a program he paid 10k for to get training, interviews, and placements. Worked for him because he was also a retired cop so he had money to put into something like that, I didn't. So shopping around, I ran into a program called **7 Figure Sales Academy,** I booked a call with them, told them I had someone doing this thing making good money, but could not afford the 10k for everything (NOTE: This is not the company my friend went with). They set me up with 3 monthly payments of **1k** for a total of **3k** for just training. I talked with my misses, and decided it was worth it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Starting the Process**

So the training was great, learned a lot of sales skills, met some really nice people during group training sessions, was pumped to try out being a salesman after I finished the course in 4 weeks! **HOWEVER,** I struggled to get jobs. Some of them on linkedin were scams, some of them wanted me to already have closing experience, and just 2 months of no responses. I felt like no one wanted a guy with 0 sales experience, even if I had training.

My friend, who was consistently making 14k/m at his remote job, told me to give the company he went through a shot. Now I was 3k in the hole with nothing to show for it but seeing his success, I felt like I might as well since I already got this far. Reached out to the company he worked with \[**Elite Closers**\], agreed to pay **1k down, 500/m until I paid off 9.8k total.** I was able to get the vetting/training done in 4 weeks, and after that I was able to do my first interview on my 5th week. I was hired the following Monday! Now at that point I was **4.5k invested,** nothing to show for it but powered through.

I was placed with a company called **Michael Blank,** who does multi-family real estate syndication/masterminds. First month, made 7k but hell yea, 3x better than what I was making before. I quit my job at t-mobile, went full time my second month with them, made 14.2k my second month, and paid off everything I owed to Elite Closers.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
**Now**

a year and 3 months later, I'm making 23k/m on average with my current offer. I'm no longer working for Michael Blank but 3 months ago, a lead generation company reached out to me through my coach at Elite Closers, and offered me higher commission so I took it. I only take, maybe 29 calls a week (I work 40 hours, each call being 1 hour long, but some people don't show or cancel). People book around my schedule and I can work anywhere I want. I've even taken sales calls on a lake while fishing. I'm so comfortable here and it's something I never thought I'd be doing, let alone from home.

**Things you should know/Tips**

As far as remote is concerned, this is easy work, you're taking calls at home or where-ever you want, people are booking around your schedule, and as long as you're performing, there's no such thing as PTO, time off, sick leave, or vacation time. However, for this to work, the sales aspect is difficult, at least to me. **Here's some things, from my experience, you should know before considering this:**

* This is **NOT** for everyone. High ticket sales without experience or training, can be incredibly difficult. Sure, the $$$ is there, but if it's not something you 100% want to make a career out of and you don't have that ""sales grind"" mindset, this will be a very uphill battle. Especially if you want to do Business to Business sales like I'm doing now, it's a slog to get through, but it pays well.
* Without direct referrals, prior remote sales experience, or a service/agency to vouch for you, getting into remote closing high-ticket sales is damn near impossible. You're fighting for **a remote position**, which everyone wants, for **decent pay**, which everyone wants, **in sales**, which a lot of people already have the skills to do. That might be different from person to person, but I needed to pay for job placements and security through Elite Closers. Without them, I felt like there was nothing I could do.
* You can apply for jobs through Linkedin (I just typed in 'Remote Closer' in the search bar, and a lot of jobs pulled up) or even Indeed, but there are some offers that are scams. On top of that, unless you do your research, the commission they offer, might not actually be what they pay out. So if you do look for these jobs, definitely pull up research on the company before pulling the trigger with them.
* It's 100% remote so there's no hybrid, it's 100% commission base unless you find a company that's willing to offer salary, and it's still technically a part time/full time job. If all 3 of those things work for you, you'll be fine.

\-

If you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask below! **Keep the comments civil!!!** I know some people feel strongly against sales or even the way I went about getting a remote sales job, but it worked for me. I want to help clear up some confusion about this topic and help people make a more educated decision on if remote sales or going through an agency like I did, is worth it for you."
"I was recently laid off from my company, which is based in NY. I live in a southern state, and have been remote since I started  the company. I applied for NY unemployment, but I am concerned that my claim may get rejected since I'm not a NY resident. Does anyone have any experience with NY unemployment as an out-of-state resident?

Edit: I called the unemployment office in my state and they said it makes more sense for me to file in NY. They said they have no record of my wages on file.

Edit 2: The unemployment office in NY says that my company stopped reporting my wages back in early
2022 for whatever reason. They're kind of a shady company so I'm suspecting tax fraud. Really hoping this doesn't delay anything, but at least I'm applying in the right state.

Edit 3: Okay, I was approved for NY! Weirdly enough, my HR told me to apply for unemployment in my current state. But after submitting paystubs, NY approved my claim and I am due to get payments starting next week. I was so afraid I'd be in UE purgatory for months. Thanks for the responses everyone!"

"When you enable your employees to work remotely, you have a choice of the best talent in your country, and in some cases from all over the world.

And conversely, when you do NOT allow your employees to work remotely, you can only choose from the best local talent.

That's all well and good, but there's a big difference

HUGE...

More importantly,

If you allow your employees to work remotely...

You instantly become a preferred choice for all candidates.

How powerful and important is that?

The companies of today that implement a hybrid mode without imposing their bogus rules will be the companies of tomorrow."

"I am self employed and working side contractor jobs to support me while I grow my business. 

I have a handful of jobs that require a vehicle but I don't always have access to a car in order to work them. 

So Im looking for ways to work remotely on my own schedule. 

Have you found any unique or unexpected work remotely/Do you know of any remote jobs you can work from home with and choose your own schedule weekly?"
"Hey Redditors! So some context behind this is I'm a new adult looking to take on some extra workload, I started a new job a few months ago working M-S (60hr weeks).
Within the last two months, l've figured out how to essentially automate all of my workload into about an 1 hour of work per day from myself.
I love the job and couldn't be happier with the pay.
However, I would love to find some sort of side hustle or remote job I could work on at the same time to help increase my savings account! Any recommendations you all have on where I should start looking?"

1. **Virtual Receptionist:** Virtual receptionists provide receptionist services to businesses, taking customer calls and managing customer inquiries. This job requires excellent communication and customer service skills, as well as the ability to manage multiple tasks at once.
2. **Online Tutor:** Online tutoring is a great way to make extra money from home. Tutors are needed to help students of all ages with their school work, as well as teach classes in specialized subject areas like languages, music, or coding.
3. **Social Media Manager:** Companies are increasingly relying on social media to reach their target audiences. As such, there is a need for experienced social media managers who can create campaigns, manage accounts, and track performance.
4. **Web Developer:** Web development is a great way to make money from home. Developers are needed to create user-friendly websites, apps, and software programs.
5. **Data Entry Clerk:** Data entry clerks are responsible for inputting data into a company's systems. This job requires strong attention to detail and the ability to work with a wide range of software programs."
"I've been at the same company that I adore for over two years and worked remotely the whole time. About a month ago I changed roles and departments and have found that I'm really struggling with remote work isolation.

I went from having a large engaging remote team (from casual conversations to work conversations) to now being just a dynamic duo with my leader. 

I've tried creating group chats with my coworkers I would consider friends but it's pretty much run dry considering they still have the support and culture I used to have in my old role.

Don't get me wrong I LOVE my new job, love my new boss, I do love working remotely, and am excited to be in this position. But the isolation and sudden lack of work culture is shocking me and hitting me hard since I didn't experience it before even while remote.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you overcome it?

TD;DR I changed roles at my company and am feeling remote work isolation. Any advice on how to fix this?"
"I've noticed a recurring theme of loneliness here, and I thought I'd bring to your attention a tool designed to make your remote work experience less lonely.

It is called [Vizor.video](https://www.vizor.video/)

It connects you with colleagues via live video through a virtual frosted glass. 

It assumes you have a team or friends with whom you can collaborate. And if not, maybe someone from this sub want to be your workmate. ;-)

Can this app make you feel less lonely working remotely?"

All these youtube videos seem to be the same about remote working and trying to get you to buy a course. I would hopefully like to find a normal part time or full time job that i can do from home that can be done via computer.
"Hey, long time creeper first time poster. I've been dreaming for years of moving into my small sailboat and working aboard. Trouble is I am not very techy, and I fear that a customer service job will suck my soul. Just wondering if anyone had any ideas beyond a vlog of some sort. I recently purchased a starlink unit so Internet won't be a problem. Thoughts?"
" 

Female engineer- I have an opportunity to get a masters in systems engineering online from a good university through my company (F500). It would be a one year full time program and I would get my full salary at the same time, school would be paid for, and I would not be expected to work while getting the masters. For most people, this would probably be a dream come true no brainer. I would also be required to sign a contract saying that I would stay with the company for two years after the masters or pay back the $35/40k on a sliding scale (ie, if I left after 1 year I would only have to pay half back, 1.5 years pay a quarter back etc). 

There are a few reasons I am hesitating. I would really love to have a remote job, and my company is firmly dedicated to being in person. I also want to start a family in the next two years which would mean I would have to use day care or a nanny. Ideally I would like to either be a stay at home mom or work remotely at home while having a nanny at the same time. Is it possible to request WFM while pregnant and while breastfeeding at companies that are mainly in office? Is it worth the risk of that not being approved?

Also, engineering isn't my passion. I am smart and hard working and wanted a job with stability, so ended up majoring in ME and this job is the best offer I got after graduating. I am finding even with my 3 plus years of experience it's very difficult to find a remote job right now. I'm looking for positions like product manager, project manager, etc. I don't love my job currently. It's fine, my boss really likes me, and I can occasionally work from home, but sometimes people notice. 

I'm on a bit of a deadline as the masters program starts early January. I could withdraw, but I need to confirm at what point the money gets paid and when I would be responsible for paying money back. If I choose to not get the masters, the director is holding a spot for me on the team to stay, but currently they are planning to replace me for the 1 year I am getting my masters so they also need to know. If I don't get the masters, it would give me more time to look for a job, but I just am so tired of this job, that the masters is also appealing just for a change of pace, remote work now for one year, etc. 

I am worried about locking myself into a 2 year contract at a company and job that I don't love. Maybe if I get back from the masters and work 9 months, take 3 months paid plus 3 months unpaid leave, then work 9 months while breastfeeding that's a short enough stretch I could suffer through it. If I absolutely knew I would get approval to work remotely I would do that without question. But it's hard to ask my boss or HR, hey in a year from now when I think I'll be pregnant can I work remotely? Is it worth staying now and trying to find a job I really like that is remote? Those are just so hard to find- both options seem like a gamble. This got long- thanks for any advice!"

Just thought I'd share. "
"During the pandemic, I job-hopped more than ever and was hired/onboarded completely remote. I ended up at a company that I really like and support, but my immediate team is really odd. 

My boss is a consultant (not a permanent employee) and she has a lot of bad qualities. In addition to being an extreme micromanager, she has other weird quirks - for instance, she focuses on my emails and how they are too long. She also says I'm not allowed to email anyone unless she signs off on it. Today, we had a project that the CEO asked for and I made the corrections (that she asked me to do), then I sent it back to him because it was time sensitive. She is in a different time zone, but immediately sent back a response (around midnight her time) that I was not allowed to send communications to the CEO without her permission. But ... others in my company do all the time! I talked to one executive who said our CEO would be happy to book time with me to chat. 

My other manager started at this company as an intern and his only work experience is here, but he's not the most helpful person. Often times he tells us wrong information and his attention to detail is lacking. For instance, he is on holiday this week and wouldn't set aside any time to prep me on how to handle certain responsibilities while he was away. He also works hybrid and constantly tells me remote isn't the same, that there is too much room for miscommunication ... but he's kind of a terrible communicator. 

They seem so terrified and there are so many rules. The first boss says things like I shouldn't tell people what we're working on in our department. She constantly rewrites my assignments, but she adds in the wrong details so other departments come back and say we're wrong. She's been in trouble a lot lately and I noticed her interpretation of what happens at work is not true. Like she kept telling us how we need a website developer and we were going to hire one. By how she made it sound, this was certain. Well, the CEO told her no they were not doing that and he chastised her in front of everyone. 

How do I handle a situation like this? It makes me concerned about the stability of my job. She doesn't allow me to connect with others (even on our own team). But still I am a permanent employee and I am being given lots of responsibility. What do you make of it? And how can I improve this situation?"
"Hi!! Im not from the US but i  have pretty good level of english and I've been trying to have a remote job because in the situation Im on i just cant do another typo of job, I started applying for jobs on websites and i got to an bilingual interpreter one but it was just too much for me, any website, or maybe a company that could have a remote job? pls help and thanks!!!"
I know this may be a strange question but I was offered a remote position for Arizona however I currently reside in Asia Pacific and I would like to work from Thailand every several months. Way that companies can track where you are if you use A VPN?
"I'm kicking around idea of using a projector as my monitor(s) for my laptop. I need something where I can compare at least two documents/spreadsheets at same time. Do any of you use anything like that? If so, any tips on brand/model(s)?

Any other tips are welcome as I don't tend to work remotely for longer than a week. I'll be working remotely away from home for a month or two at a time, any advice is welcome.
 
Thanks!"

"I was laid off a few months ago. During the first 2-3 months I applied to literally every single related job offer but I didn't even pass the second interview. Then a friend explained to me the 3-stage process she used and it worked for me. I also used a few tools that ended up being very useful.

After 2 months of using that preparation system, I was offered 3 positions! 2 of them with a higher salary than the one I had in my previous company.

I learned that finding a new job is a job in itself. You improve with practice and by failing. So the 3-stage process is designed to iterate fast. In every stage, I focused on ""Mastering that stage only"" and improving on 1 metric:

**Stage 1 Iterate my Resume** **(metric: Conversion rate from CV sent to first interview scheduled):**

My main focus in this stage was to improve the conversion rate of my resume. The metric I used was the % of responses I received. I kept refining and tweaking my resume until I achieved a solid ratio. I started with less than 5% response rate (from *resume sent* to f*irst interview scheduled*).

I did this:

* Adapt my resume for every position (I used a few tools, mostly kickresume explained below).
* When describing my previous experience, rephrase it using the exact key words used in the job offer. A lot of companies use software to filter resumes, so if they don't find certain keywords, you are automatically rejected.
* Create a cover letter ""template"" and leave some paragraphs to modify depending on each company
* I created a notion page with a more detailed resume, with links to previous projects and a lot of details about me. I added this when asked for a ""Website URL"" (asked in many offers)

Once I started getting first interviews with HR managers or hiring managers (1st interview), I shifted my attention to preparing and improving my interview skills.

**Stage 2 First interviews (usually with HR) (metric: Conversion rate to second interview with manager)**

In this stage, I aimed to increase the number of second interviews or technical exercises I was offered. This was a critical step in progressing further in the hiring process. I made sure to thoroughly prepare for these initial interviews, showcasing my skills and experiences effectively and I used a few tools (below) to practice my interviews.

You'll be asked the same questions again and again in these interviews with HR. With Otter you can transcript the meetings. So I created a document with ""Hard Questions in Job Interviews"" as a quick reference during interviews. I have the answers written there for all the typical questions. If you do online meetings, you can keep the doc open on your second screen 

**3 Use case (or technical exercise) (Metric: Job offers received)**

My metric here was the number of job offers I received. This stage varies a lot depending on your role. I was applying for Product Manager, in case you are also applying for this role let me know and I can give you some examples of exercises I prepared in advance.  


Here are the tools that played a significant role in that process:

**1 ChatGPT - Turned into a job interview trainer**

You start by training ChatGPT on your resume. You can use this prompt

>As ChatGPT, you'll be participating in an interview simulation for the position of Product Manager at \_\_\_\_. I'll provide you with your Resume in an upcoming message. Following that, you'll receive the interview questions along with guidelines on how to respond.  
 

Then you copy&Paste your CV on ChatGPT. And you give it this new prompt

>The focus of this interview will be on your soft skills. When answering questions be clear and concise, using everyday language. Create convincing responses that an interviewer would appreciate even if they are fictional. However, ensure that your answers align with the experiences mentioned in your resume.  
 

Then ask ChatGPT the interview questions you may get and it will be generating perfect responses to any question.

**2 kickresume**

Use it to improve your resume. You can do several things with it. Start your resume from scratch or modify one, create your cover letter with AI (it uses ChatGPT on the backend), or ask for feedback on your resume. I still needed to do a lot of manual changes in the version it creates but it is a great start. For cover letters, which can be quite a hassle to customize for each job application, it was a real-time-saver. Another option is Rezi, I haven't tried it yet but it looks promising.

**3 Wave Coaching**

It provided a written conversation with a real human coach, utilizing AI to offer guidance and assistance. The coaching sessions helped me develop habits for finding the right jobs and mentally preparing for interviews. I used it a lot in stage 2. I would go to Wave with the answers I replied on every interview and they would help me improve them with feedback. Ultimately, they also helped me negotiate the offers. I'm so bad at facing conflict and asking for a higher salary, that my first instinct when I was offered the first job was to say OMG OF COURSE. I was able to raise the salary a bit and also the stock options they gave to me.

**4 Otter or tldv**

You can use it during your online meetings to take notes. During job interviews, it is not only important the content of your answer, but also how your answer is structured. And the only way to improve this is by practicing. With this tool,  I could review the questions asked and my responses, allowing me to refine and better structure my answers. Write down your answers and then use ChatGPT to improve them and structure them in a way that is easier to understand!

**5 Interview Warmup (from Google)**

Similar use to the first one with ChatGPT but in this case they ask you the questions. It simulates a real interview and gives you personalized feedback based on your responses. It can help you identify areas where you need to improve. Also, by practicing with these tools, I felt more confident and prepared for those higher-stakes real interviews.

I hope this is helpful to you!

Any other tool I should add?"
"So I just reviewed my paystubs and am getting taxed in two states (state income tax). That's annoying. The only thing making we not to jump off a bridge is that I can apparently get a tax credit in the state I live (NC).  I left NJ to avoid the ridiculous taxes. Cannot seem to escape it. 

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this tax credit working remotely? Do you essentially get all your taxes back from the state you live? Seems i'm gonna want a tax accountant this tax season and i've always liked doing my own taxes. Sigh."

"Hi everyone,

I've been in public libraries off and on for over 10 years. I enjoy it a lot, because I like helping people and working with the public. But my partner is the early stages of a career in academia and will probably have to move multiple times in coming years. So I'm looking to obtain a remote job in libraries, archives, library vendors, or publishing. I don't *have* to find a new job until summer 2025, but I may want to go ahead and transition now.

If you transitioned from in person to remote work, especially if you are in a similar field, what do you see as the pros and cons of your decision? I made a table (lol, I know) with my own ideas, are there any other points you would add to either column?



|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|-get a new start, no bad reputation- get my dignity back|have to meet all new coworkers and boss|
|-get to learn a new industry or at least skills|-want to transition back to libraries eventually|
|-probably busier, less boring|-probably much less downtime to read in|
|-getting ready in the AM/being on time easier, no commute|-harder to get going if I'm still at home, harder for partner to leave the house|
|-less contact=don't have to socialize when I don't want to|-might get lonely|
|-easier to do quick things house tasks like cleaning|-may be tempted to leave computer too often for these things|
|-no FMLA/wanting to impress new boss may help w/absences|-no FMLA for a year|
|-now we'll have a hotspot whenever internet goes down|-internet not always reliable, have to pay for hotspot (price?)|
|-possibly better pay|-possibly worse pay, but I won't go lower than $20-21 ($23 right now)|
|-this will have to happen in 1.5 years anyway, could get it done early to avoid stress at that time when partner will also have lots of stress|-applying for jobs is both tedious/lots of work and emotional if I get rejected|

Few things. I have health problems and have had issues with attendance. I'm covered by FMLA, but unfortunately I now have a bad reputation among some of my coworkers. I have so much anxiety about this, that I feel taking a new job would help me restore my dignity and improve my mental health. However, I won't be eligible for FMLA for a whole year if I start a new job.

Another consideration is that my current job has a LOT of downtime in which I get to read the news or an ebook. I'm so used to this that I worry a remote job is likely to have stringent ways to check if you're working, and that it'll be hard to adjust to a solid 8 hours of real work.

Lastly, I have a very limited social life. No friends really, but I do have a partner I've known for half a lifetime, as well as a big loving extended family. My coworkers are the only people I interact with otherwise, and though we aren't friends (it's not like we ever see each other outside of work) I don't want to grow too isolated. I'm a hermit and I don't feel lonely right now, but I don't want it to worsen.

Thanks in advance for your help! I truly appreciate it."
In need of remote work. My father recently became sick and it has escalated pretty quickly. My mom is a nurse and needs to work to keep the house afloat and get my two siblings through college so I would like to work from home to help take care of him. I studied English in college and minored in media studies. Currently I am a healthcare recruiter but I have some experience in sales and writing/editing. I graduated in 2021 so an entry level job would probably be best. I have tried LinkedIn and friends companies located closer to home but have had no luck. Any ideas on where to apply?
"I graduated last year with a BA in sociology and for various reasons, remote work would be best for me. I've been applying to jobs and feeling very discouraged trying to sift through the BS to find something actually remote or not an MLM. I trained search engines with Telus throughout college but my contract ended so I was let go. I have media analytics skills from that. I also have research skills from my time in college but lack the experience a lot of places are looking for since I just graduated.

Ideally I'm looking for something full-time, flexible hours preferred but I assume that's a pipe dream so not a requirement. $30kish+ is fine. I'm honestly open to most opportunities besides phone-based customer service/sales. Also, I live in the midwest. 

Should I lower my expectations or is this doable?"
"i was graduated from computer science faculty , and my flutter mobile experience is 3 years  , and i am working freelance but i want to get remote job , how to get it , i used many websites for remote jobs and upload cv but does not response , is there any recruit company or person can help me and give him percentage ?"
"Great article, link below. 

TLDR: Annie Dean, head of hybrid work at Atlassian, speaks about moving to a workplace model where people can work from anywhere. 
She discusses making sure all employees, whether in the office or remote, feel equally valued, connected, and able to progress in their careers. 
Offering people flexibility in how and where they work can attract and retain top talent while also appealing to a diverse range of working preferences.

We own our construction company and it's always been good to us.  However, our kids are currently making waves in the rodeo circuit. Making waves..  In any activity will make you spend way more money then before. Travel is killing us and that's just one part of it.

I'm in need of a work from home position.. 

Anyone know of anyone hiring"
"I have a twist in my life, and I would like to change something a bit, therefore I have found an option and time to spend time away from home, but still - keep working my remote job.

Therefore I would like to ask, can you suggest some places where to spend month or two (maybe switch places time to time). I was looking for something like quite affordable living options (airbnb, or other networks especially meant for remote workers, or you would like to invite me over and host me) and maybe good places where to spend working hours (open offices, nice caffees etc).

I am not sure if I want to divert too much away from my timezone, where rest of my team is based (GMT +2, Riga, Latvia), as well as, this is yet a wild thought in my head, because I haven't spoken to my HR, CTO and Leads.

As well as I would like hear your experiece travel while working. 
As well as if there are already similar posts, welcome to share with me.

Thanks!"
"Hey everyone! One thing I've experienced working remotely is how much influence your home office has on your productivity. Often it's necessity that gets people to work from home and we don't get much time to think about the environment in which we work.

What is the most annoying about working from home that you'd even pay someone to fix for you?"
"Remote work is a workforce strategy that enables people to perform their work from a location outside of a company's office. This may be from their home, a satellite office, co-working space, or coffeehouse.
Social mining or remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the rise of technology and the internet. It offers many benefits such as flexibility, cost savings, and increased productivity2"
"I'm so damn frustrated. I live and work in the US. I was hired full time from contract position. All I asked for is one month to work outside the US from my home country. I'm a permanent resident here and a citizen in the other so there's no problem with immigration too.

Also I don't have any access to confidential information as such but still I was denied saying the 'cumulative number of days that all employees can work outside is...& that there is potential exposure to tax laws and stuff which is BS bcuz my paycheck would be deposited in the US account. It's not like I'll be staying there forever.

The company also has a separate SOP for work from abroad request so I'm assuming it happens often but I don't get their reasoning.

I don't understand these policies."
I am a 23 year old male and need a remote job due to having eoe and colitis making it hard for me to work in an environment outside of home.

"Hi fellow remote workers,

Would love to know if any of you would be interested in a home exchange with another remote worker ?  No-one pays for accommodation and you know the home has a verified workspace or home office, and reliable wifi so you can work comfortably and productively.  
Benefits - visit a new locatoin, work from some-one else's home and don't pay for accommodation.  
Thoughts ?

"Hi everyone,

Another redditor recently suggested, given my background, to look for remote tech sales jobs. I have over 20 years experience in both IT and sales positions, as well as tech sales and managing sales teams.

I may have to part ways soon with the company I helped start, for various reasons that aren't all so bad. It would be a mutual agreement, not be fired. Mainly I have branched out into working with an NGO and my company has turned from shaky to a rapidly sinking ship after ownership changes.

Currently located in South Africa for a bit, but from NYC. Obviously I'd *prefer* a US based company that would allow this remote work, for the pay. I have a strong lead with a UAE based company with ops in the US, but they'd want me back there after speaking to them. Very friendly and hiring manager told me I have a great background and they'd love to discuss sales positions when I'm back.

Where might I look? Any ideas besides roaming through Indeed endlessly?

Thanks!"
"Longer time lurker, first post.

A lot of people work remotely for companies under a B2B contract - surpassing the financial legal limitations of not being in the same country as every company can hire services from worldwide companies.

Do any of you have experience with this? How did you manage to apply under this conditions? Any advice to find positions/companies available to do this? 

I'm open to the idea, but I feel that I'm constantly being overlooked for not fit the requirements for applications (eg, living in the us). 

Thank you "
"I am from UK, have the right to work in UK of course, although do not currently reside in the UK. 

I have a wide range of experience when it comes to sales and also in customer service. Most jobs on job sites want you to be located in the UK for their role. If you can evidence that you are a citizen and can legally work, but the work is 100 % remote why would it be an issue? 

Most likely due to licenses they have for their dialer or the need to attend a monthly meeting in person. 

Where can I find a remote position allowing me to work outside of the UK where I can work in a sales role?"

What country should I choose to work remotely? 
All of them have cons but what I would like to know is:

- if I work in a country that is not where the company is based(so not Europe) how is everything managed? 
- where do I have to pay taxes? 
- how about pension contributions? 
- what kind of benefits should I ask?

Any suggestions or advice is much appreciated.

Hey. I'm 22 y/o college student who majors in Game Dev (Computer Sci side). I received the news that i won't be able to get pell grant bc of some dumb shit from tax returns that i had no control over i'm not eligible for pell grant. My loans cover $6,000 which is awesome but i still need 3,700 by December. Despite my family literally being the one to put me in this situation they refuse to help me and basically just told me i'm on my own and offered things like putting my car on loan and get a job to slowly pay it off. My degree is very important to me and while i don't like fast food and retail i will do it to make ends meet if i have to. But i always wanted to do Remote. Not bc it's easy and less demanding but more so i like tech. I can't get a CS job bc i'm not a graduate yet so custom service and other jobs like that are the only none entry remotes jobs i see. I came to ask where is a good place to find remote jobs.

"Hi friends, 

I am currently in desperate need to secure a source of income. I have a doctorate degree in physical therapy but have been significantly burnt out by clinical work from my last position and am looking for a change. I have been seeking something new and applying without prevail for nearly the past 6 months (typically positions still in the healthcare field, but roles not involving clinical care). I am also taking google's project management coursera course to add various other skills to my resume. I have been receiving job rejection emails left and right, including those stating entry level or only a GED requirement, and am becoming quite discouraged with the process (as well as beginning to panic). 

At this point, I am willing to take on any type of remote role possible, related to my field of study or not, that will allow for cash flow as I have some pretty hefty student loans to pay off. 

I am currently seeking advice, tips, tricks, possible job postings, websites to check out (I have scanned this forum for some popular ones already and appreciate everyone who has contributed), or just some overall help and insight as I am currently at a dead end and feel that I haven't been able to experience any notable positives in my current search.

"The pandemic has defined the importance of remote working skills as a top priority. Analysts expected that employers will increase work from home or remote work options by adopting hybrid work culture as the future of work. And Yes! They were right. Today, businesses that can rely on digital technologies and internet-based platforms are at the cusp of revolution. It is a much-needed and most logical revolution that completely transmogrifies processes and paves the growth ways for businesses as well as the people.

The remote or hybrid work culture works best or only can happen with the right set of well-equipped talents. Benefits and Assets that are being provided to associates play a vital role in remote work culture. Flexible or Hybrid work culture is something that is going to take over the remote work culture with its benefits. A company, Ajackus has set an example of how a company can work fully hybrid or with a flexible work culture.

* Identify service opportunities for clients

He also told me this: I got interested in asking him more about this employment offer and he went on to inform me that all new employees have a starting salary of $50,000 which is a good salary and a huge opportunity for you too, he also mentioned that within the course of your employment, the company will also secure US work visas for their employees working abroad.


Is this common?"
"So I'm switching jobs soon and my ultimate goal is to be fully remote so I can travel around.

I just got offered a position as an Information security engineer and a cloud architect. Right now since I work in the government space these jobs are hybrid but eventually I'm counting on the skills attained from these jobs to land me a fully remote gig.

With that being said which job do you guys think would have a better trajectory as far as job security as well as being fully remote outside the government space."
"Hey everyone!

I've been working 100% remotely for a few years now and from a few different places, using different setups. I am compiling and sharing technical information that can help others setting up a convenient setup to be geographically free. Whether you're coding from a cozy cafe, a distant beach or a computer you don't own, having the right tools can make all the difference.

I have started simple and will share a more complete and ready to use codebase including ansible, packer and terraform soon. Hope it helps some of you in the meantime: [https://bluwr.com/p/873145](https://bluwr.com/p/873145)"
"Hello all,

For those of you that classify as ""Extraverts"" (social butterflies) how did you manage the transition to work from home? Was it hard not being able to engage with your peers or customers? What we're your coping strategies, if any?

Cheers!"
"Looking for work from home job (urgent)

Looking for a WFH job that requires no experience. Not looking to be paid a lot either. 150-200 a week is fine.

Thanks."
"I've heard good things about remote insurance sales jobs, and been looking to get into the field, but a lot of the jobs out there are scams, MLMs, or 100% commission. Are there any remote jobs out there with benefits/base pay? Are they hard to get? I have some experience in marketing, business, and I have a marketing degree.

If anyone has any experience applying/working in this field, I'd love to hear it!"

**Hello wonderful people\~**

I will try to sum up everything that is happening because I truly need some advice.  
After covid mostly, I have been struggling a bit with work. I was working from home for a company but they only needed us for one specific project, when it was over they sent us our way. So the last year I have been trying to find credible information of what I can do online and I was living with my mom which I was also taking care of. Well we took care of each other. She was my best friend.

This summer while I was away for a couple of weeks.... I lost my mother. I couldn't believe my ears when the girl I had to take care of her called me to tell me about an in home accident.  
My whole world collapsed. I still cannot believe it. I miss her terribly every single day. Some days I feel I can handle it and some days I'm beyond devastated.

Due to me not being in our apartment when it happened, a whole procedure started and I am still not able to go back until they do all the paperwork. Yes on top of grieving I cannot even go to my own home and have access to my things.

So I am lucky enough to have amazing friends that I stay with but I am ""forced"" to move around cities and sometimes abroad. This makes it so difficult to find a job in person. I tried but when you have to go around, they wont really hire you.

I am in such a loss. I don't know how to think. I am grieving, and I am basically broke and I don't even have my things, winter clothes etc. I basically sometimes don't understand what Is happening and I am not sure how to handle it? I did post on a grief thread as well of course. 

I am in desperate need for a job to at least pay bills that keep coming and get food, and possibly winter clothes -\_- ... and most ""online"" things I see people suggesting turn out to either be scams asking you for money too, or things that don't work or need years of work . (I am in Europe) Any suggestions on the matter?  
I just...I miss my mother so much (I lost my dad when I was in high school so now it's just me, no siblings either) , I miss our home and I am extremely overwhelmed with what is happening and also with all the paperwork that I am not even sure how to do.

*Thank you for reading. I am sorry it was a bit long. I just need to take these things out of me. I know some people may be going through similar things. You never know when you might get great advice or a friendly ear to listen.*

**Have a wonderful day!**"
"So I'm about to start a remote position in fed government. Future supervisor said the agency doesn't care where the work is performed from as long as work gets done. Wife is also a remote worker in private industry. We plan on having a home base out of AZ or CO and every other month spend a month in various locations mainly in the West/Gulf coasts.

Looking for others with similar goals, experiences you've had, any resources, as well as any hacks you might have to cut down on expenses.  

Thanks!"
"Is there any remote work that can be done from anywhere? I see many remote opportunities in the US, but the condition is that you must be based in the US. I regularly come across job offers that interest me, but it appears that if you are not from the US, you do not have any chance, despite the job description stating ""remote."" How does this work?"
"Hi, 

I'll be looking to switch to remote work/work from home with a flexible schedule within the next 3 years. I'm trying to explore what options are available. Currently, in my mind, remote work is data entry, medical billing/coding or Amazon customer service, but I feel like there are a lot more options I just don't know exist.  

My ideal remote job would primarily be based off of task completion rather than working x amount of hours a week, relatively low stress, and compatible with being a parent of a newborn/not in school yet child.  I'm currently a HS guidance counselor with advanced degrees in social work and sports leadership and 2 undergraduate degrees in social sciences (sociology; agricultural, leadership, community education).  I'd like to find something that I wouldn't have to get more schooling, but also not opposed to having to go back to school.  

Any suggestions on what to look for that would match those criteria?"
"What are the best places to look for this type of jobs, I live in a remote area in Mexico and I speak both languages, I've been unemployed for an entire month and I can't find anything in this town (either extremely underpaid for 12 hours or requiring recommendations from certain people I haven't acquainted.)

"Hi.

>TL;DR Working fully remote sounds lonely AF, convince me otherwise

I am an avid office goer. If at all possible, I am there everyday, purely because I want to. I like the office environment, the networking and socialising, and the routines that go with it. It feels childhood school days, showing up and meeting the gang and doing things together. I have developed many meaningful friendships that started in the workplace and continued beyond that.

Working completely remotely concerns me. I am in my early 30s, working in IT, and am an expat in a foreign country, single, without kids, living in an apartment alone. There are however many interesting career opportunities that seem to be fully  remote, and it appears to slowly become the norm.

I am concerned that I will feel isolated, lonely, and start to develop bad habits. Things like only waking up 5 minutes before a morning meeting, not having clearly defined start/end work times, not leaving the home or speaking to a real face for days on end, not taking the time to eat real food.

During corona, my life was getting out of bed, walking 5 steps to my desk, working for 8hours, closing the work apps and opening personal apps, and eventually walking 5 steps back to my bed. I don't want to go back to that.

I hear many stories about people with relationships, families, kids, etc. who rave about how great they feel working from home. I do not hear any such ravings from people who are alone, though. Are there any people here who live alone and work remotely, but have a positive experience?"
"Is it just me, or is California literally the most difficult place to get remote work?

More than half of all the websites, jobs or otherwise platforms I sign up with or apply to say that they are not currently accepting applications from my state.  
I know about the whole *California Assembly Bill 5 (AB5),* but it just seems like more than only freelance jobs are affected.

Has anyone else living in CA experienced this? Why is this the case and where *can* I find a remote job in CA?"
"Hello, I am greek living in London for the past 2 years. 
I found a work from home job customer service 23k. Which is  not great for London standards but for greece is a lot of money for a single person.

I am not supposed to work from another country but a colleague  same position works from Romania and nobody knows anything from the company. 

I am thinking to do the same few months per year with my laptop to work from Athens. I'll use vpn on my phone (not the computer) which I'll use as hotspot.

Any thoughts? Do they really care and check from the company where is everyone working? If I use vpn(UK) from my phone and use the phone as a Internet hotspot?"
Im looking for a remote job that I can do at night. Im only 19 and have no degree. If you know of anything it could be greatly appreciated.i also have a MacBook that I would be doing from.  thank you in advance!!
" I was interviewed today for a new (more senior) position within my company and the interviewer said that he would prefer someone who can be hybrid (job listing was remote so I was kinda caught off guard). I stated that I would be open to hybrid (currently full remote) but would prefer fully remote. However, I have been thinking on it and I really dont want to be hybid. I have been wanting to move out of the state for a very long time and fear that starting a hybrid role will prevent me from ever leaving. If I get extended an offer, I am going to counter offer that I only can be fully remote. If they insist hybrid, is it sensible to state that I would be open to considering a reduced salary? I don't want it to sound out of line but I genuinely would take a HUGE pay cut from the stated range just to be remote so that I can move. "
"There is a common question on this subreddit nearly everyday about wanting to find a work-from-home job that does not require talking to people on the phone.

I applied for a chat job a couple of weeks ago with a popular staffing agency. I received an invite to a virtual interview that included questions where you would respond by audio or typing short answers that consisted of 2-4 sentences.

One of the questions asked was about phone calls which confused me because accepting inbound calls was not listed in the job posting or title.

Recruiters are aware that non-phone jobs are extremely popular among job seekers and will attract a lot of applicants. Many are posting misleading job ads or straight up lying about the job requirements.

According to Indeed, a chat specialist position for Gubagoo received over 17,000 job applicants on Indeed alone. That number does not include people who applied directly on the company's website or other job boards. For data entry, Adecco, a staffing agency, had 8,761 people who applied on Indeed. The other data entry and chat jobs received over 2,000 applicants.


Meanwhile, some Fortune 500 entry-level jobs paying $40,000-$60,000 with benefits are getting 60-100 applications because people are scared to talk on the phone .


Due to the high volume of applicants and the very few non-phone positions available, there is a STRONG chance you will NOT find a non-phone job.

There are exceptions for those with experience and degrees in IT, computer science, and accounting.

There is the internet search evaluator/rater but you must pass the exams which are not easy. It is not a full time position. You can only work up to 20 hours.

Even if you do find a non-phone job, the pay is significantly less and those who worked as a chat agent said they were expected to talk to 5 people at once and that is not as easy as others believe it to be."
Does anyone know of one? I would really appreciate it! 
"I live in San Francisco and would love a work-from-home/remote job

I have ten years of sales experience but I don't want a 'hard-sell' commission-only position so a soft-sell/customer service job would be great.

Thanks in advance

"Hello /r/workonline

I've noticed that a lot of the online job boards dedicated to remote work tend to be very Tech/IT focused. And when looking for non tech work at home opportunities I seemed to get flooded with scam jobs or MLM's.

So a couple months ago we started an online job board at https://nomadiccareerservices.com/forums/forum/job-postings/

We look for online jobs in Admin and Data Entry, Education, Healthcare, Human Resources & Management, Information Technology, Marketing and Design, Sales and Customer Services, and post new roles daily.

We try and post a diverse selection of jobs from entry level roles in customer service or transcription, to executive or director level positions. The job board is completely free, and is a fun side project from our main jobs.

If you guys have suggestions on what kind of roles you'd like to see posted, I would love the feedback.

Thanks"
"I'm looking for suggestions for non phone remote jobs.  I have other people in my home and its a little difficult to have a consistent quiet area. I'm in the US and I already do e commerce and lionbridge. I'm not into transcribing, I've tried so many times and I've failed haha."
"I live in Maryland and I keep getting callers trying to hire me saying something to the effect of ""is such and such city in Minnesota a good commute for you?"" I'll specify that I had applied to their remote job, and then they'll get all flustered and apologize for the ""confusion."" What benefit are they even getting from wasting their own and everybody else's time? Any thoughts?"
"I'm from Mexico, I'd like to know if any of you have any recommendations to WFH, preferably earn in USD."
"Hi guys im from Italy and for like 6 months I haven't even found a remote work site, in reality I have found several but none of these apply from my fantastic country which is Italy (if you are not the son of a lawyer or have a recommendation you just have to be a waiter lifetime)  
I was wondering if any of you or any Italian know any site to help me earn even a simple sum to pay for water and daily bread."
"I feel like a lot of people don't understand this. As someone who got a taste of working from home during lockdowns I LOVED it. It's nice working remotely. But there are ABSOLUTELY jobs you should probably avoid. If these jobs are shitty jobs in general, then working from home won't change that... in fact, it will probably make them WORSE.

For me, the biggest red flags are customer support jobs. Whenever a job ad states they're looking for a ""rockstar"" or ""hero"" I know IMMEDIATELY that they're desperate and can fuck right off. Call centers are by and large also just shitty places to work for. Two call center companies YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY AVOID:

1) Sykes

2) Conduent

These jobs will make your life a living hell. I worked for Conduent and it was garbage. My friend, bless his soul, somehow lasted 6 months at Sykes. I didn't even last a month at Conduent. The call volume and shitty customers were just too much for me. And I say that as someone who just finished working two years as an office admin answering 60-100 calls a day. So phones for me are not an issue when people aren't jackasses 95% of the time. 

Even though I REALLY want to work remotely I WILL NOT stoop so low as to take a shitty job just to do it and neither should you. However, I recognize that these are troubling times so if you're desperate I can understand needing to apply to these jobs. 

Feel free to post good/bad companies to work for and what your thoughts are on this down below. I'll go ahead and recommend Caption Call as a good company to work for since you don't actually speak with anyone. I worked for them back in 2013 and they were great. I make a lot more than they offer now though so it would be pointless to go back for me at this point. 

What is everyone's thoughts on this?"
"As the title say, i'd like to assist my parents financially since i feel useless sitting in my bedroom all day. I have a medical condition which keeps me bed ridden, and i'd like it if i can help out as a functioning member of society from home.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions would help, i don't mind doing data entry jobs or whatever. The upside of being in morocco is that our currency is low enough so that even 300 dollars a month is more than enough to make a change.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for charity, i'm simply trying to help out around the house more. Let me know please. "
"Here's a guide to the best places to find remote jobs.

It's from this [article](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/where-to-find-thousands-of-non-tech) (body text copied here so you don't need to click out)

**Where To Find Thousands of Non-Tech Remote Jobs**

Hi,

Welcome to Remotely Inclined, a newsletter about remote work and remote entrepreneurship. If you'd like to sign up, you can do so [here](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/welcome). Or just read on...

Before I started my business, I was laid off twice in a matter of three years. The instant thoughts and fear of whether you'll be able to pay rent (or a mortgage), pay for food, or provide for a family is damn-near heartbreaking. My soul goes out to you if you've recently found yourself jobless because of the global pandemic going on. 

As the title of this newsletter suggests, though, there are literally *thousands* of remote-first jobs that you can get - and yes, they are still hiring even through this pandemic. 

If you're not feeling totally ready to jump on the job-search train, I get it. My good friend Lianne Vineberg, a brilliant HR consultant and talent strategist, wrote a solid article on [what to do when you've been laid off](https://www.talentinthe6ix.com/blog/so-you-got-laid-off) (hint: it involves taking a quick break if you can).

If you ARE ready to find a job, or perhaps financial circumstances have forced you to be ready, that's what this newsletter is all about - the places that you can find remote jobs.

Two quick things before we dive in: 

1. If you have a secure job, that's amazing. I ask that you forward this to any folks you might know that are out of work (or in precarious employment, likely to be out of work soon). 
2. If you are intrigued by remote but really can't stand it, there are many companies hiring tens of thousands of in-person jobs such as [Walmart, Domino's Pizza, and more](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/hiring-companies-seek-thousands-employees-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/story?id=69767851). Just think of companies that make things everyone hoards in a crisis, and you'll find job opportunities. 

**Remotive io**

Remotive is a large community of remote workers and remote companies. While most of their jobs revolve around technical skills, there are many customer service, marketing, and support roles which don't require any technical skills. If you worked in retail and got laid off, these roles could be perfect for you. 

Link: [https://remotive.io/remote-jobs](https://remotive.io/remote-jobs)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remotiveio](https://twitter.com/remotiveio)

**Daily Remote Jobs**

A job board and Twitter feed that shares all sorts of remote jobs. The best part is that most jobs are worldwide, meaning that you don't have to be worried about your location when you apply. Their schtick right now is about finding a remote job so you can travel the world. The travel part doesn't apply in this case, but the jobs are very real.

Link: [https://dailyremote.com/](https://dailyremote.com/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/daily\_remote](https://twitter.com/daily_remote)

**Remote OK**

Another job board with thousands of remote jobs posted, and more posted every day. The advanced filtering for job types is a helpful way for you to filter out jobs you really don't want to do or aren't qualified for (thinking those remote dev jobs if you're not a developer). 

Link: [https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs](https://remoteok.io/remote-jobs)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/RemoteOK](https://twitter.com/RemoteOK)

**WeWorkRemotely**

Self-touted as the number one destination to find a remote job, WWR boasts jobs added daily. 

Pro-tip: The site doesn't have much in the way of filtering, so you'll have to scroll down to see the non-dev /non-tech roles. 

Link: [https://weworkremotely.com/#job-listings](https://weworkremotely.com/#job-listings)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/weworkremotely](https://twitter.com/weworkremotely)

**Remote Co**

While Remote Co is primarily a resource for remote company leaders (which could be great if you suddenly find yourself in that position!), the site also has an extensive job board. This platform seems to be the most non-tech friendly, since many job categories are things like finance, admin, data entry, content, and more. 

Link: [https://remote.co/remote-jobs/](https://remote.co/remote-jobs/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remote\_co](https://twitter.com/remote_co)

**Remote Habits**

Remote Habits is a blog about remote work, featuring remote workers and remote entrepreneurs (I was even [featured](https://remotehabits.com/interview/interview-with-stefan-a-founder-building-a-location-independent-startup/)!). On top of that, they have a job board that scrapes remote jobs from all over the web. That means you may see a lot of duplication (particularly from WeWorkRemotely), but you'll also find additional jobs that are posted in smaller job boards or ones you may not know about. 

Link: [https://remotehabits.com/jobs/](https://remotehabits.com/jobs/)

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/remotehabits](https://twitter.com/remotehabits)

**FlexJobs**

A resource for all kinds of jobs, FlexJobs has an explicit section for remote work. The platform also features research on companies and other job-seeker aids. Most of the jobs are for Americans only, but it's possible that you could still apply and perhaps get hired as an independent contractor. 

Link: [https://www.flexjobs.com/jobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/jobs). You can also check out this [pre-defined search for remote work jobs](https://www.flexjobs.com/search?search=&exclude=&location=&country=&tele_level%5B%5D=All+Telecommuting&tele_level%5B%5D=Option+for+Telecommuting&will_travel%5B%5D=&accolade=).

Twitter: [https://twitter.com/flexjobs](https://twitter.com/flexjobs)

**Dynamite Jobs**

Based out of Texas, Dynamite Jobs is a global community with a focus on remote work. The platform has some of the best filtering mechanisms I've seen in the remote job board world - timezone, salary, job category, and more. 

Link: [https://dynamitejobs.co/](https://dynamitejobs.co/)

LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/dynamite-jobs/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dynamite-jobs/)

**LinkedIn + Craigslist**

LinkedIn is the world's largest professional social network and Craigslist is the world's largest digital classifieds. In both cases, there are tons of jobs and the opportunity to search for remote jobs or ""telecommuting"" jobs. 

Note: Craigslist has a reputation for being sketchy, so be careful. However, many jobs posted are completely legitimate and shouldn't be discounted.

Link: [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=92000001&location=Remote](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?geoId=92000001&location=Remote)

Link: [Craigslist.com](https://craigslist.com/) (Then go to jobs - Telecommute filter for your city)

**Niche Google search**

Sometimes, the work you're looking for or are qualified for doesn't fit into a neat job board. When in doubt, try some googling. 

I recommend using one of two Google formulae: 

1. ""Remote job board \[LOCATION\]""
2. ""Remote \[JOB TYPE\] jobs \[LOCATION\]""

With the first style, you'll likely find a lot more open roles. The second style, though, could help you land the perfect job if you already know exactly what you want to do. 

And if you've already tried these searches in the past... I'd say try again. With the pandemic growing, many companies are shifting to remote when they previously would never have thought about it. 

**Don't forget to ask**

If you're applying to any role that's done on a computer, don't be afraid to ask if they will accept remote work -- at least for the time being. Some companies had never thought of remote, so they wouldn't know until you ask. If the company says they want to focus on in-office work only, there may still be flexibility for you to work remotely while a pandemic is going on and then transition to the office world when the time is right. 

I know that applying for jobs can feel scary. I had to do it a bunch when I got laid off before deciding to focus on my business. But my hope is that these resources help you just a little bit."
"Howdy Remoters!

I'm [Luc](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-mengel/). I'm the founder of [Remotewx](https://remotewx.com/).

I've launched Remotewx 

Remotewx is a remote job board on the web to help you find a career where you can work remotely from anywhere. We only accept listings for job positions that are 100% remote. Most of the companies we share are distributed or remote-first companies.

Now you may ask: *""Does the world need another job board?""* I completely agree with you [](https://emojipedia.org/folded-hands/) . But many of my friends are still unable to find a remote job. Why? It is because, many job boards do not differentiate between covid-remote and full time remote. A company that is fully distributed from the ground up is not the same as a company that offers work from home during covid.  
At remotewx - We have a lot of  for companies that are completely remote.

Best,  
Luc from remotewx"

"I love my work from home job. It's just an online call center. But they are making us install something called remotedesk.me and it seems like a massive invasion of privacy. Constantly monitors your screen and camera scanning and recording for  suspicious activity. It's absolutely creepy to have a third party app doing this. It has to constantly scan our face biometrics and we have to scan our government Id when clocking in. 

Background movement? Violation. 

Suspicious facial gestures? Violation. 

Anything on your desk including phone drink or food? Violation.

Room too dark? Violation.

It tracks everything you type, say, do, and look at and it seems like a massive invasion of privacy. Im  gonna have to look for a new job.

It's so obvious it's not even for security, it's purely data collection of workers and it's disgusting. 

Anyone else deal with this at their jobs?"
"I graduated with a BS Environmental Biology degree. I'm planning to enroll for a Master's degree in a year or two but I need to earn in the sideline while I study. 

The problem is, personal life and mental health struggles took its toll and I can only work on jobs that doesn't require talking to peers. I can only do chat or email as communication. I also chose to work from home because I get severely bad episodes and I will just brute force those episodes but I don't want co-workers to witness me writhing in pain lol.

If it helps, I also have a pretty capable computer if there are some jobs that require it. And I'm used to writing research articles. The job doesn't have to be related to my field. As long as people won't need to see me, I'm okay with that."

"Hi everyone! 
My bf and I are looking to relocate to Germany some time in 2024 and while I plan to get a job there my bf has been hoping to be able to find a remote job here in the US that allows him to work from Germany. He's been talking to recruiters for a few months now but none of them seem to have any experience with that sort of situation. 
I was hoping that maybe someone on this thread has had some experience with this or something similar and can share some advice? 
Thanks and cheers guys!"
"I tried to do lionbridge but failed the test. I did a couple of transcription jobs and it didnt work out. Havent heard anything from Appen.  I tried to do essayshark and failed the grammar test.  I tried to be a pearson and measurement inc grader and didnt get it. The only thing Ive done decent is sell on ebay :/

Edit: Thanks everyone! I appreciate your comments and feedback, I will be reading them shortly. Keep commenting if you like!"
"I need to get a job sooner rather than later, and with my current situation it would be best to get a remote job or one that I can do from anywhere, since I plan on moving. So I've been looking at remote jobs on Indeed, and I feel like it might be a waste of time. It seems most of the job offerings are either for skilled positions that I'm not qualified for, or they feel scammy or not like real jobs. I figure any legitimate remote jobs probably have thousands of applications coming in since anyone anywhere can apply, so I'm not likely to get picked.

Has anyone had any luck with getting a good remote job on Indeed? Is there a better place I could be looking? Unfortunately a lot of these job sites don't even list the salary for the job, or it says ""$8-25"" an hour. That's kind of a need-to-know, no? I would be looking for something that's around $20 an hour or more. I do have a degree in English and some experience, so writing could be a good gig, although I'm not really sure how to get into that as a career or find legitimate entry-level positions for that. Unfortunately most places want to hire experienced writers and I graduated a few years ago."
"Hey everyone, I wanted to share my experience of working remotely for the past few months. There have been a lot of ups and downs, but overall I'm really enjoying the flexibility and freedom that comes with it. I wanted to start a discussion on the pros and cons of working from home.

Pros: Working remotely has given me more flexibility in my schedule. I can take breaks when I need to, and I can work around other commitments. It has also allowed me to spend more time with my family, since I don't have to commute. I also appreciate the increased productivity that comes from being able to focus without office distractions.  


Cons: When you're working remotely, it can be hard to disconnect from work. The boundaries between your personal life and your work life become blurred, and it can be difficult to relax and unwind. This is especially true if you work from a home office. Isolation and loneliness are other common challenges of remote work. Without regular interactions with coworkers and the outside world, it's easy to feel disconnected and alone. Finally, remote work can make it harder to manage your time and stay focused.  


Has anyone else had a similar experience?"

"I have been looking into remote or online only positions for the past month or so. I will get excited about an opportunity only to find they don't hire in my state (WA). One such company was Arise. It was right up my alley and I saw a lot of opportunity. But then I clicked on the tiny link at the bottom of their site (Is the Arise(r) Platform available in my location?) and got the coverage map and lo and behold...not hiring in my state. I thought it was mostly because our minimum wage is higher and they prefer states they can pay lower wages, but I came across this article about states laws and how some companies are rebelling against them by not hiring candidates in these states (which, of course includes WA).  Just thought it was interesting to share and be aware of.

"So, I'm a 20 year old man from Rome as well as a university student following all his lessons. My family has recently fallen on some hard times and I feel like a burden, so I'm looking for a way to make as much money as possible with the little time I have available, and as a full-time student it seems like the best option would be online work, which would allow me to work on my own time.
I don't have any particular set of skills, I'm decently fluent in english so I considered translating, but there isn't much demand for english->italian translation, and I'm told that translating into your second language is considerably more difficult, so I'm not sure if I should keep it as an option.
That's about all, I'm not expecting miracles, just taking a shot in the dark and asking for some ideas if you have any."
"Remote Customer Support jobs in Europe

Hi, I have around 2 years experience working in customer support and have worked for a global bank, iGaming and Forex trading companies. I need a legit job that I can do from home in Europe. I've looked at Indeed and LinkedIn but didn't find much. I speak only English. 

Thank you"
"It looks like most of the gig and freelance sites like Fiverr have a 14 day wait period. I'm looking into both long-term jobs and short term gigs and temp work, but it would be nice to find something that hires quicker or has a quicker payout than 2 or more weeks. If you know of any within the customer service/virtual assistant/call center/support specialist/etc field, let me know!"

Most platforms ask for people from US/Canada/Europe, etc.. (Varsity tutors for example).

I have strong skills in multiple subjects as I hold an **engineering degree in computer science**, a **Toeic certificate in English Listening and Reading** with a score of 905/990, and have also performed 2 **years of Mathematics studies** in university.

I also speak **Arabic (Native)** and **French (Fluent)**.

Not enough? I have 5 years of experience in industry as a software engineer in my country. However, I want to start working online even not for the best rates at the beginning.

"In my free time this week, I've collected all the remote jobs for designers over the past 30 days. The list of vacancies is available here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NafyaTudHVUWCePMZrROockCXcOp4kNDhDSZRpGAIWE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NafyaTudHVUWCePMZrROockCXcOp4kNDhDSZRpGAIWE/edit?usp=sharing)

The difference between this list and those that you could see earlier is that vacancies are collected not only from job boards websites but also from companies' sites. According to my calculations, for every vacancy posted on the job board, there are two vacancies that are not posted there. It is difficult to search for companies that post information about open vacancies only on their website, but I consider it important, as it helps good people find their dream job faster.

I made the table editable and I will be glad if you contribute. Add the open position of your company to the table.

Good luck looking for work, I hope my work and the work of other people will benefit!"

Hey r/WorkOnline! I'm the Customer Success Manager at 4PatientCare, and [we are hiring again](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/7gxdfu/were_hiring_again_at_4patientcare_awesome_remote/)! We've always had good luck finding awesome candidates through Reddit (I was hired from a Reddit post!) Check us out at [4PatientCare.com](https://4PatientCare.com).

We are looking to hire a Technical Support Agent.  Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

A little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes the world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions. This is a place for people who are willing to take on any challenge that comes their way. ""That's not in my job description"" is not a phrase we believe in. We're more of an ""I'll figure it out!"" kind of team.

Transparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve (here are our [Glassdoor ratings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-4PatientCare-EI_IE760463.11,23.htm)). We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team.

Also don't be fooled, we're not a startup. We've been in business for nearly 20 years delivering more happiness to healthcare.

&#x200B;

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively. We do not micro-manage and we do not hand-hold. We strike a balance between giving enough training and direction so that you're not totally in the shark tank without a life vest, but oftentimes it'll be up to you to be proactive to problem-solve and get. things. done. If you're lost and without a map, do you wait for someone to notice and show you the way or do you actively reach out to get the direction you need to move forward?
* A natural curiosity and a strong desire to learn. Do you thirst for knowledge and yearn to explore the unknown? Do you like to know how things are put together and what makes them tick?
* The ability to roll with the punches in a dynamic work environment. Do you welcome change and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing setting?
* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art? Is an upset client someone you fear or just another opportunity to turn someone's frown upside down?
* Strong organization skills and attention to detail. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day? Can someone throw ten tasks at you with specific instructions for each and trust that everything will get done and get done right?

The main responsibilities of 4PatientCare Technical Support Agents include, but are not limited to:

* Setting up new clients and existing clients with their requested services.
* Assisting with basic pricing changes that occur when clients request changes to their current services.
* Taking incoming communications to support existing clients regarding issues, bugs, feature requests, and feedback.
* Engaging with customers about those issues, bugs, and feature requests and managing expectations about when everything will be resolved.
* Quantifying the importance of those issues/bugs, measuring feature request frequency, and advocating for the fixes users are finding most troublesome.
* Understanding the direct impact our services and service have on our clients, and within the confines of our system, doing everything possible to benefit clients' businesses.
* Creating and updating support documentation as processes improve.
* Assisting and training on tasks and areas that you have become proficient in.

Basic Requirements:

* Must be a US citizen and reside in one of the following states: AL, CA, CO, FL, GA, MA, NC, NV, NY, PA, or UT.
* Must be fluent in English.
* Must have a computer and a working Internet connection.

Compensation:

* $16/hour during initial training period, which lasts a minimum of 3 months.
* $18/hour after graduating from training
* Paid Time Off (up to 10 days a year), Paid Holidays Off (6 per year)

"TLDR; Company didn't tell me that I needed to use my personal laptop (w/ VPN and remote desktop) for my new remote job, which started on 5/2. When I told them I couldn't use mine (notified them before the start date), they sent me a wiped laptop that never arrived (delivery link says delayed for a week). They know this, and now they're saying that I need to find a way to connect to their VPN by tomorrow or they'll terminate me. I had offered to push my start date to after the laptop issue was sorted, but they said no -- I was supposed to receive my first paycheck on 5/13, but I haven't, and I'm worried that they're going to withhold my income even though they told me that I would be paid despite knowing I didn't have the laptop yet. My questions are:

(1) Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and would I not qualify for unemployment? I live in Illinois, even though the job is in Ohio.

(2) If they withhold my income from the first 10 days of work, is there anything I can do about it? I read online that federal law only requires employers to compensate minimum wage for hours worked and that's all I'd be guaranteed to receive, even if my offer letter stated my salary.

(3) Is my frustration here fair? Like, would it be reasonable for them to expect me to just use my own computer for this job even if they didn't say that during the hiring process?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently accepted a data science job offer from a large hospital, where I would be working with sensitive data. They advertised the position as remote friendly, and sent me an offer letter (I did not sign a contract, since I thought it best to keep things as flexible as possible). They were aware that I would be working 100% remotely.

It is standard in data science (unless you're part of a very small non-profit or start-up) to receive your computer equipment from the employer (most data scientists need a laptop at the least, and many also receive monitors or docking systems), so this is what I expected in this position. A couple of days before my scheduled start date, I realized that they had never formally told me that they were sending me any equipment. I reached out and asked, and they said that they expected me to use a VPN and Remote Desktop to connect to their on-campus computers for the job (without ever clarifying whether I had the tools to do this myself), and that he could give me a $100 Amazon gift card to ""furnish my office"". He reassured me that this setup was perfectly safe, though the security configuration stuff isn't my purview.

My computer sucks and wouldn't function properly for this, and beyond that, I wasn't comfortable with the idea of using my personal computer for work in any sense ($100 wouldn't make a dent in the cost of a new one). I (politely) told my boss that I couldn't use a personal computer and needed a company laptop for the job, and that the job description never said that I would be expected to furnish my own equipment. He said that they could send me a retired 2-3 year old laptop as a ""gift"" - which I found strange because it felt like they were trying to dissociate themselves from the computer and made me worried about liability working with sensitive data. He added that the entire thing had been wiped and I would be expected to install a new operating system myself (specifically, Microsoft 10 and would need to purchase the $150 license); IT also said that sending me a fully set up company laptop would not be the ""best use of resources"". I asked them if I would be reimbursed for this, and whether the Amazon gift card could be put towards this instead, and my boss said I should be happy I'm getting a free laptop and that I should offer them flexibility because they had been flexible with me working two positions at the same time (they made the conscious choice to hire me, knowing that upfront). He rescinded the $100 offer and said he'd ""try"" to lump the reimbursement into my signing bonus, which I declined because that can be retracted if I leave within a year of my hire - but I said I would do my best to install a free operating system and let them know how that goes, and they agreed. I told them that I'm also happy to push my start date (5/2) to after the laptop issue had been resolved, and they said no, and that they would still pay me and I could focus on other tasks in the meantime (like onboarding, research, and reviewing SQL).

The laptop was supposed to arrive on 5/6, but it never did and the tracking link says ""delayed"" indefinitely. It's been over a week now and boss is saying that I have to find a way to connect to the VPN tomorrow, or they'll terminate me, unless I choose to move to Ohio for the job instead. I also checked Workday and saw that I was supposed to be paid on 5/13, but I never received the deposit and I'm worried they'll try to withhold it. Can they terminate me for-cause when they never sent me the essential tools I needed, and can they legally withhold my income from the first week even though they knew that I didn't receive the laptop from them?"
Sorry if this isn't allowed on this sub but does anybody recommend remote jobs that will train? I'm pretty much all new to this.
"Simple as that. Anyone feel really good about a job they can do from just about anywhere in the world with (hopefully little more than) an undergraduate degree? 

More info: I'm looking to transition out of a 15 year career in the service industry, moving semi-permanently to Italy in about 18 months, have a degree in International Studies. I could speak volumes to my varied experience but prefer to cast a wide net here. What do ya'll do remotely that makes you more than remotely happy about what you do?"

"I live in the UK and have been looking for remote work from home for so long now on numerous different websites, but it seems like over 95% or so of the remote jobs are listed in USA, Canada, and other countries in the World so I've not bothered applying for them.

I just found it a bit strange considering that it's remote work but seemingly requiring you to be in a specific country.  Am I thinking of it the right way, or should I just apply anyway even though I'm in the UK?  I'm finding so many jobs that I know I'd be perfect for, having done a lot of remote work in the past and having relevant experience, but it's unfortunate that the locations for them are outside of the UK.

If so, are there any notable UK based remote work websites worth taking a look at?  I've used Google a lot recently to find some, but every time I go on the jobs page they're all based outside of the UK even though they're classed as ""work from home""."
"As someone coming from Europe, but from a country not belonging to the European Union, I can say that there are hardly any companies open to remote work where I could apply. Jobs, and even most job search engines, are mainly focused on the USA market.

 I have 16 years of experience as a video editor, colorist, involved in audio design, and I've worked as a video and creative producer. Can anyone advise me on where to look for a job? I've been without income for a long time, and I can't endure without earning. I have bipolar disorder, and it's very difficult for me to work in a collective, so remote work is my only option."
"I'm trying to save up for a move, I already have a job so this would be a side job, I really only need it for a few months so something seasonal is totally fine. 

Customer service isn't a requirement it's just I don't have an insurance license so things like that aren't going to work out but the only thing in really trying to avoid is hard sales or commission based jobs"
"Landed a really great one this past summer with a start-up insurance b2b broker firm. Flexible, good ""kept appt"" commission, paid .40 per call, however that REALLY added up, full-time, esp with all these no answers. Got a lot of appts set, good commissions, paid weekly, etc. Received top performer rewards, bosses considering me for an even bigger roll.  However, starting around after Halloween, we were getting tons of push back by receptionists/aka ""gatekeepers"" (screening for solicitations, etc lol) and decision maker managers,  open enrollment wrapping up soon, ""we already renewed"" or whatever other crap. After a great run of weeks prior. So, after three weeks of hardly any appts set between myself, two other seasoned setters, and the two licensed sales agent bosses, the main boss decided to put the call center on a ""prospecting freeze"" which will possibly lift after the holidays and resume by ""quarter 1"". As the holidays will be a huge waste of money with nobody available, or not til later, or unwilling to change anything until then. And I got a really nice check....they paid me for every appt I'd set upcoming and ones prior that didn't even show, out of a courtesy, and an additional $500 on top of my base weekly pay. But, they'd given like zero forewarning of this freeze. Even despite my nagging them feedback about issues and us needing to have a team meeting to find some solutions. plus the scripting they had us use was pretty bad. Boss 1 was willing to try some new strategies and do a team meeting set for the Monday before the freeze was announced, but the Thursday before, boss 2 butted heads with boss 1 and said it'll make no difference. Let's freeze. We are 1099'ers, mind you, so we aren't privy to retention pay. 
So, while they're ""restrategizing"" etc I've been applying like crazy, once again, to everything and trying new ways of searching. Like organic Google search of outsource companies and looking via their career sections. As indeed and LinkedIn seem to be mostly scams!!!!!!!!!!!!!! any wfh setters, BDC, rep, anything. or spoofs of real companies. it took me two years, over thousands of applications, to land that one damn job. lol. Rejections from good ones because, assuming I failed their stupid assessments, personality tests and timed nonsense that I REALLY suck at. 

I have so many years experience in bdc rep, retail sales, automotive sales, medical office,  call rep, sales management, appt setting, b2b, have my own freelance graphics and media co. which seems to be a failure since a year ago, and lack of need or interest in that, and can't even get regular normal work in even that!!!  etc so should be no reason not to. But wondering if there's any suggestions on certain companies to look into, other clever searching tactics, keywording tactics, niche things, etc. Have been keeping eye on the WFH mom job blogs, rat race rebellion, etc. apply to everything there when they pop up lol. Rejected from Telus after they had me in line to do their exam. Data annotation seems impossible to get into.... over saturated???
I live in Ohio, so many aren't eligible for certain states. Had a few that tried to loophole that, because I was a great fit, but that didn't work out. lol. 

Also, what's the likelihood that my current company will resume business again this coming quarter? Its a start-up b2b insurance firm where we try and set appts for small to medium companies to sit in for a zoom qualification review with the sales team. they however, are only focusing on the tristate for now. Kinda limiting it.

Also, any tips on searching for ""remote order takers"" or other alternative niche remote ones like that? anything work from home, with some sorta base pay, at least. 
Been trying calling local places to see if they'd be interested in an appt setter as well. Had luck with one, but they were only wanting to do commission only then turned out they weren't a very kosher kinda run company and a legal-grey area with their practices. So, didn't pursue any further. 
Had a solar sales place interested back when I was still working with the other company, but they're no longer looking, supposedly.  Apricot Solar. lol. 

An outsource call center/ BDC company I found while randomly searching Google and checking out company sites and their job openings,  was also interested, had interview #1, went very well  , was onto interview #2, and basically had the job until the main manager had a miscommunication issue with the other one and they hired another person day before my second interview even happened yet it was scheduled, and that manager wasn't willing to ...remedy their mistake in the end. Long story. Then it got weirder.  Was really weird. Was a company I wanted to work with, but the one manager and how they ran the company... kinda gave me pause. 
But yet its supposedly this great company... and located in the area I grew up in. 

Anyway, enough of my rambling lol."
"So, I've been working in the Prime Video dept from the past 1 and half year as a content moderator and news is that I might be laid off, which is scary, this job has been my bread and butter. Another thing is I've never worked in any other role before and hoping to get a better role in this particular domain added to that, working remotely as well, as I have a lot pending to finish at my new home. 

Idk what should I do, where should I even apply for such roles. Does anyone know what are the websites to get on to apply for such work roles? 

Another reason why I'm sounding so desperate is because of the college degree that I had to pick (I didn't study but rather I was forced to study) was microbiology which in no way comes close to what this job is about. 

So, please, I humbly request your aid on this problem of mine."
"Hi guys! So I just left my job due to some personal harassment issues I was having. I'm looking for full time remote/work from home jobs paying upwards of $12/hr. I've looked around on Indeed and applied to a few, but I'm having a hard time finding something I feel I'd have a great shot at. Let me know if you have any tips or tricks to landing a job like this!

A little about me for insight:

I have experience in customer service and administrative assistance, as well as some (limited and not listed on my resume) experience in telemarketing that I feel would be relevant to a remote type of position. I have a real passion for writing, but no paid experience to show off. I have a high school diploma and completed some college.

Thanks for any advice/insight!"
"Hi, so I finally landed a job at a Telekom company for customer support and was very happy, however I am in a weird situation where they told me I will be full remote, I generally was looking for remote jobs because I want to go abroad to my partner, I am curious if working in such positions makes it possible to be abroad on another person's house and work from there, from what I was told by the HR, they said that I would be expected to work from the same country, just remotely. Also remote is mandatory. What do you think?"
"Back in November, my husband and I had a house fire. Insurance didn't pay for the entire rebuild. We had to take out a 22,0000 loan in order to finish the house. On top of that, I hired a company to put up a privacy fence for 9,000, which the fence was never put up properly and ive had other companies come look at it and they said it needs to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch. My husband just got home from a 7 month deployment and currently works Monday through Friday and does Doordash on the weekends. Im a registered nurse and I work night weekends. Im looking for a job that allows me to work at home with flexible hours. The current place I work at is not a very healthy environment and don't offer much overtime. I would also like to be able to see my husband during the week since I hardly see him on the weekends. I would do Doordash as well but its just not steady enough income for me."
"Hi! I'm not sure exactly what information I'm supposed to be looking for or how to search for jobs but I've seen a lot of helpful information on this sub. I'm sorry if you've seen a lot of similar posts and I seem repetitive!!

I 20f am moving to a small town in Germany with my husband for his military orders, we're moving in a little less than 6mo so it's about that point where I'm getting anxious about planning. From what I've learned from other spouses that I've spoken to, there's not much work available in these small towns that either don't require speaking German or having a bachelors and my other option would be working on the military base, which my education would still be an issue unless I wanted to work more of a customer service/clerk role. I would ultimately prefer to work remote if possible, but I'm not too sure what my options would be.

A little background on me, I currently work as an office manager at a small chiropractic clinic and have some general knowledge about insurance and billing as well as the typical administrative tasks. I started here almost two years ago and have worked my way to this position from the front desk. My only other experience is some jobs from high school (barista/shift lead).

I don't have any post high school education(to my regret) and I understand that a lot of remote jobs might not care for my current skill set but I was hoping to see if anyone had some ideas on what might be a good fit. I've struggled a lot to find solid answers on what/if companies based in the US allow for work across different countries and I am running out of time to build up my skills. 

Thank you for taking time to read this post and I hope I didn't ramble too much, any and all advice would be greatly appreciated."

Hello, from quarantine, USA!

 
I have seen a huge number of posts requesting the same thing- ""How do I work from home/ online?"" and starting about two weeks ago, I was in the same boat. I spent the good part of the first week delving into any and all subs, posts, leads, anything that could get me money, while I am at home and no longer working. A lot of these places do take some time for hiring, but this is the list I came up with. Hope it helps some of you guys out there!
 

I had previously used r/beermoney sites and apps, all of the usual suspects, such as Swagbucks, InboxDollars, etc. and never really found a liking, or real use for such low paying survey and ""Paid To"" sites/apps- though there were a few winners that I discovered:
 

-Qmee, QuickThoughts, BigToken, and though the questions are rare, payments are instant and take literally seconds to answer-> 1Q
 

-       Honeygain-> interesting app, you sell unused data. I average about $0.08-0.15 per day just for having it installed on my phone. Minimum payout is $20.00 and when I downloaded I used a code to start with $5 right off the bat.

EDIT: HoneyGain was only applicable to android/ windows users when I signed up. I have since gotten notifications that they have expanded to apple as well, but cannot confirm personally- if someone can in the comments that would be appreciated.
 

ACTUAL WORK:
 

So, as I mentioned I am looking for actual working opportunities. I do not have any secondary education, just a high school diploma. This limited my selection pool, but not nearly as much as I had thought, given that I have an interest in writing and have previously used websites such as Fiverr and Upwork, so I had a small professional portfolio to work with, though it was old content. Freelancing is fun and I will get more into that later, but now the jobs:
 

USER TESTING:
 

User testing is generally testing websites for security, bugs, display, a number of things and projects. These companies offer work in this field-
 

Appen/Teemwork.ai, LionsBridge, TryMyUI
 

VIRTUAL ASSISTANT:
 

Generally requires a landline and wired internet, though not all companies. Fast typing skills and being a personable person is key.
 

FancyHands, VickyVirtual, Zapier, Ttec,
 

TRANSCRIPTION:
 

This is typing out audio from videos, or audio files- sounds easy, but beware, some files can have horrendous audio from the research I have done into this field.


QAWorld, GoTranscript, Rev, Transcom
 

WRITING:
 

As I mentioned earlier, I have an interest in writing and have used freelance sites such as Fiverr and Upwork before (note: those sites can be used for more than just freelance writing), but upon more digging there are quite a few sites to check out if you enjoy writing. I may get shilled for promoting content mills, but hey, we all gotta start somewhere:
 

iWriter, TextBroker, PostLoop, ProBlogger, Constant Content, Crowd Content
 

PAY TO SITES:
 

Much like the r/beermoney apps and sites, these mostly involve surveys and clicking, but figured they were noteworthy and shouldn't be left out of the list:
 

Gain.gg, Prolific.co, ClickWorker, Neevo, Google Ratings, Amazon MTurk
 

 
Best of luck everyone, stay safe and prosperous!

I get it is still work but not having to leave the house sounds great.

Is there any way that I can get a job in the U.S from my country, since it's something remote? Maybe a chat service, idk, just something in that area. If so, where? And I don't care if they just pay me 6 dollars per hour, that would be more than the minimum salary in my country, and I could do it from home while I study for college. Thanks in advance!"

"I am working in a company that is england based but I am remote working from ireland. I'm curious as I have just been given an offer from some friends to live over in Spain, is it possible to move over and continue to work in the same company? I know asking the company directly would give me the best answer but I don't want to make it known what I'm trying to do in case they don't want me to and I decide to see if I can get away with it anyways. I have asked friends and am getting different answers, some say it breaks tax laws and the company would find out, others say the company VPN will mask you as being in the office anways so they will never know. I would appreciate anyone with knowledge on this to leave some advice for myself and anyone with the same question."

"Hi all - I work a 9-5 and make pretty good money from it, but recently got into some medical debt (had an unexpected ER visit and surgery earlier this year) and I really want to pay it off sooner rather than later. I work in HR for my full-time job, and I can type quickly (up to 100wph), I have a lot of customer service skills (I worked in retail for many years before this job), and I'm free pretty much after 5pm on weekdays and on weekends. I also have a Bachelor's degree. Does anyone have any suggestions? I really don't want to resort to babysitting/petsitting/housesitting/doordashing/ubering. TIA!"
"Hello all! So I am in the process of finding a job. I have my BA in English and my plan is to secure a remote job (probably in proofreading, editing, copywriting or something of that nature) that offers insurance and flexible work hours. Im just trying to get a big girl job (and save gas money) as opposed to my previous jobs as a barista/waitress. Also, I don't really care what I do in a sense because I am actually an artist and am just trying to find a remote job that will fund my hobbies and help out my mom.

  
In my gut I feel as if Im closer than ever to finding an online job that works for me, but Im struggling with legitimizing the job offers I get.

  
Every once in a while I get a message from employers (text and or email) asking if they can interview me and now Im wondering, are there questions that I can ask them upfront to deduce that they might be scammers?

  
Im asking this because I recently got scammed by an online employer. It low-key broke my heart a little because the job and pay were practically perfect, and I want to help my mom out with the bills as soon as possible.

  
What questions should I ask these possible employers to figure out if they are legit or not? What are the major red flags? What are the major green flags? Any other information would be much appreciated. Thank you!! Happy holidays!!!"

"Hello, first post here, but I just felt like I needed to bring this matter to attention as I'm wondering if I'm the only with this problem or if others had it as well.

For a few years, I had always been trying to apply for remote work with Appen, but I've never got qualified for one. The last time I tried, I gave up, and the system later on locked my account due to inactivity. That was how it was like back then. So when I wasn't able to sign in recently, I thought it was due to that again. However, I still couldn't sign in even after doing a password reset. So I went to support about this and basically this is what they told me...

>**""Thank you for reaching out. Currently, Appen has made the decision to deactivate your account, and unfortunately, we are unable to reactivate it. As business decisions are considered confidential information, we are unable to provide further details. We sincerely appreciate the time you have dedicated to working on our projects, and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors. Thank you for your understanding.""**

*So when I went to ask further about why my account was banned, this is all I get as their last response:*

>**""We hope this message finds you well. We are writing to inform you that, following a routine review of user activity on our platform, your account has been Permanently deactivated.**  
>  
>**As a committed provider of a safe and respectful digital environment, we maintain a strict policy adhering to our community standards. These guidelines have been developed to ensure that all users and clients feel comfortable and protected while engaging with our platform. It is our duty to inform you that there have been instances of activities linked to your account that appear to be in violation of these standards.**  
>  
>**Our dedicated team has conducted a comprehensive investigation into these activities. While we understand your potential concerns regarding this matter, please know that we are unable to share specific details regarding the investigation or the violations found due to privacy and safety reasons. Our decision is based on the information gathered during this process and is final.**  
>  
>**Thank you for your attention.""**

It seems apparent to me that now Appen acts very similar to YouTube, where they just randomly decide to shut down people's accounts for no good apparent reason. Which explains the lack of transparency here. As they can't even at least tell me why, yet they have the audacity to state that they can't even share details why due to privacy and safety reasons over guidelines that once again aren't even mentioned. All of this as their way to get over and ban me just because they felt like it.

Again, I would like to know if anyone else experienced this as well. It's just strange to me because unlike some, I've never even got a remote job with them. All I ever had done prior to this random ban was me simply trying to apply for remote work, which had always been unsuccessful. My wild guess is maybe they became overly paranoid or something. Telus seems way more trustworthy as I've never had any issues like this with them. Whereas I did at least got qualified with one remote job as an ads evaluator / rater. But that only lasted one year as a contract.

So now I'm still trying to look for more remote job opportunities. The only else that sorta helps out is Prolific which I found from here. Anyone here got any good suggestions or alternatives over Appen?"

"Hi! Not sure if it's the right place yo ask for this but I was tryng to understand the remote work system. The thing is: I'm from Argentina and I've applying for quite a few embedded software positions both in the us and canada. I know quite a few people that work for third party companies, meaning, companies that are allowed to hire people from outside US and make the link with the actual positions needed, others directly open branches in Latin America or Asia. My question is: let's say I want to apply for a job to work remotely from Argentina without actually living in the US, could I apply for a work permit or visa if I won't travel to the country? Does something like that exists? I would really appreciate if someone could throw some light at this. Thanks for reading!"

I'm in the UK so ideally would like Brits to respond however I do want to leave the UK so internationals please also give your thoughts.

I am more of a hands on person, being used to working with my hands. However I know the world has changed and the money flows online now. Some insight into what you do and if you enjoy it would be great as there are many remote jobs that I've seen but I'm not sure if I would enjoy it for too long

I've mostly been using Indeed but I've found next to nothing and even those that seem promising I never get anything back. Thank you for any and all help/advice, it's extremely appreciated!

edit: Wow, I am absolutely overwhelmed by the response this post got. Sorry any sort of response took so long, I'm honestly afraid of this sort of attention. I'm going to answer some common/repeated answers here instead of responding to everyone with doubled answers, I hope that's okay! First being disabled vocational services, I'm applying for my state's version, it's through snail mail but I'm pretty confident I'll be approved! I've noticed some saying to apply to customer service for chat/im/text systems, and I have in the past and they all rejected me because some of the work (such as meetings) require the ability to join video calls. Another one was factory work, which is a good idea! Recently I've gotten a diagnosis that makes it impossible for me to lift heavy objects, but I'll still look around to see if there's anything within my capabilities. Thank you all so much for your responses, and I hope this thread can help other deaf folk looking for work too!"
"When I first started working remotely, people were talking about ""remote work"" (or even ""telecommuting"") in a lot of different ways. COVID has certainly changed how we talk about remote work, but the shift was underway for years. 

I published the [original content in my newsletter](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/the-shifting-trends-in-how-people), but copied the body text here in full so you don't have to click out.

**The Shifting Trends in How People Talk About Remote Work**

I started my remote business in 2017, though it was remote out of necessity, not privilege. My business was a side-hustle until 2019. I still had a 9-to-5 job and couldn't run any business that required my physical presence. But before that, I was paying attention to the burgeoning remote work movement. 

Remote work had been a thing since the dawn of the internet (and arguably before that), but it started to hit a stride in 2014 after a major Harvard Business Review article: [To Raise Productivity, Let More Employees Work from Home](https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home). This interview took aim at Marissa Mayer, the Yahoo! CEO that famously stopped all flexible work arrangements and brought everyone back into the office (no comment on how that worked for Yahoo!). 

Now fast forward to 2020, and everyone's talking about remote work. It's tempting to say it's all cause of COVID (and admittedly a *lot* of it is), but these conversations had been happening for years already.

So for today's newsletter, I'm diving into the shifts I've seen in how people talked about remote work, in particular the evolution over the past five-ish years. 

Without further ado...

## From fad to fan fave

Remote work was seen as a novel thing in 2014 / 2015. Despite it being leveraged by many successful companies at the time (Automattic - the makers of Wordpress - is remote and was founded in 2005), it was largely talked about as either a fad or the domain of some tech nerds but not the bulk of the economy. 

Now, studies abound on the popularity of remote work. A Stanford University [study](https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html) from 2017 shows how much more productive employees are. OwlLabs [State of Remote Work study in 2019](https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2019) found that remote workers are happier and stay in jobs longer. And now a Gartner [study](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time) from 2020 shows that 82% of companies are planning some form of remote work for the future. 

## From individuals to companies

Perhaps the largest shift in the remote conversation came from a shift in focus. 

In 2015, a lot of the remote conversation was focused on the individual - in particular, the digital nomad, or the person who is a remote worker or freelancer for the sake of travelling the world. One entrepreneur proclaimed there would be [one billion digital nomads](https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/) by 2035. From there, major publications from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesleadershipforum/2015/12/22/globetrotting-digital-nomads-the-future-of-work-or-too-good-to-be-true/#271890767594) to the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/16/digital-nomads-travel-world-search-fast-wi-fi) covered the digital nomad craze, questioning whether it was the future of work.

It's also worth noting the gig economy was a strong player at this time, with companies like Uber taking hold. So the whole economic conversation was around gigs, freelancers, and the potential of technology. 

In 2020, the conversation is all about how companies can win at remote work (heck, it's what I even talk about on Remotely Inclined). With remote assumed to become a common way of work, there's less need to highlight the rare individuals who made it work. 

## Remote became a status symbol

I interviewed [Shelly Spiegel](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/our-success-is-because-of-culture), the founder of 80+ person all-remote company Fire Engine Red. The company has been remote since Shelly founded it in 2001, but she didn't start talking about their all-remote status until 2011. But even at that time, companies were hesitant to make too much of being remote. The same thing happened with [Floyd Marinescu](https://remotelyinclined.substack.com/p/you-need-to-build-systems-the-inner), who founded all-remote company C4 Media in 2005.

Pride for being remote started to creep in during the 2010's, but it was not necessarily an outward or marketing thing. 

Just a few short years later, being ""remote before COVID"" is a rallying cry. Having technology or services that can be delivered remotely is a competitive advantage (with obvious reasons in COVID's case). This is something even I've benefited from, having been remote in 2017. This isn't uncommon, though. When things become mainstream, those who did it ""before it was cool"" will always get a credibility bump. 

## Remote washing, bashing, and branding

With popularity comes criticism. That can't be avoided. But it's been interesting to see the progression of how people criticize remote work. 

In the early days, it was simply written off. This was perhaps ironic, since people were becoming millionaires on the backs of their remote businesses, a model that naysayers wrote off as nearly impossible. 

Now we see three new trends. Naysayers can't deny remote work's efficacy (though I happily admit that remote work is not perfect for every person nor every type of work). Instead, we see conversations around: 

* **Remote washing**: slapping some marketing language about how your product works for remote teams. 
* **Remote bashing**: leveraging personal negative experiences with remote work to generalize that remote work is *actually* bad. 
* **Remote branding**: shifting the company's identity to include remote (in some cases, acting like it's always been there). 

Remote washing is almost a compliment. When everyone changes their marketing language to catch onto a rising star, it helps separate out the people who actually focus on it and do the work well.

Remote bashing is similarly almost a compliment. When you're written off out of hand, you are considered culturally irrelevant. If you're being bashed, the underlying truth is that you're part of societal conversation. Plus, it's usually pretty easy to tell when someone is universalizing their own negative experience or personal distaste versus putting out an actual criticism (the latter of which is *not* remote bashing, but honest conversation).

Remote branding is a mixed bag, in my opinion. Sometimes it's very legitimate. For example, if a company always had some work flexibility but now they are making it official, I don't really see a problem with that. But then you hear about organizations ""embracing"" remote work that also [won't let working mothers care for their kids](https://www.thelily.com/florida-state-just-barred-many-employees-from-caring-for-kids-while-working-remotely-moms-ask-what-am-i-supposed-to-do/) during work hours and, well, it's clear they just don't get it. 

## Remote as an office equivalent to remote as a way of work

Perhaps the greatest shift in remote work conversations I've seen is about the concept itself. For years, remote work was seen as an alternative to the office, or a virtual version of the office. This is half-true in the sense that work is done in an office and remotely, but it misses the point of the story. 

What I'm seeing now (which aligns to how I think about remote work) is that people are beginning to understand remote is a *way of work*, not an office equivalent. It's not a cure-all for office woes. It has its own problems. It's not perfect. But it has some amazing benefits as well that the in-office model can't replicate, particularly around freedom of location. 

Personally, I am really happy the ""remote work is just a virtual office"" mantra is on its way out (though COVID gave it a little bump from March to May 2020). When something is held on a pedestal as either a copy or a saviour, it cannot go anywhere and it cannot grow. Remote work is not perfect - and that was never the point. Remote work is a fundamentally different way of work, and people deserve the option to choose it (or not) for themselves."
I currently work from home for a company that does not allow offshore support. I am interested in moving out of the country. Does anyone know of a virtual call center that does offers positions where the person can work not just remotely in the US but in other countries as well - for example Dominican Republic
"**I have exactly zero affiliation with Babbletype.**

I subscribe to a freelance writing newsletter, which lists remote writing opportunities. In the most recent edition, there was a listing for transcription work through Babbletype.

**[Here is a link to the Craigslist post.](http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/wri/5573528231.html)**

This isn't the kind of job I'd generally apply for, but I thought that people over here might be interested, so I figured I'd share.

Just a note: if you're new to paid transcription work, the rates listed are per hour *of sound*, not per hour. So the pay isn't as high as it looks on first glance, but to my knowledge, it should still come out to something pretty reasonable.

**EDIT**: I've never worked for Babbletype, nor have I done remote online transcription work. As such, I'm not the person to ask if you have any further questions about the position. I don't know anything except what's in their Craigslist post.

**EDIT 2**: /u/Alaaaah did the math, and estimated that it would probably come out to about $7/hour. This isn't as much as I would have thought, and it's low enough that it's not worthwhile for me personally, but that doesn't mean it couldn't be a decent opportunity for some of you out there."

Is it possible to find a remote job with these skills? I think I have strong programming foundations down and would be willing, eager and able to learn any language and tools needed for the job. I have a decent grasp of C, c++, I played with python and Java during university. I have messed around in networking in C and in the gamemaker language and believe i understand the theory of it at a novice level. I would be willing to learn any language, even low level ones (played with assembly in uni and really loved it).  
  
Do any jobs like these exist or is it just very wishful thinking? I'm realize it is very unlikely but i figured I'd ask."
"Is there any remote management jobs where they are accepting college student (Still going to college, will be finishing up this year) however I want to be able to work from home. I do have some experience with remote management."
"Is it possible to get a digital marketing, accountant or other types of jobs .. to be work from home for your first job? 

Say you took marketing courses, portfolio, or had a degree. Or, an internship. Would you be able to work from home without need in person experience."
"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I'm college educated, but only have an associates degree for now. Thought about going back to school but want to get my foot in the door with work.

&#x200B;

I've tried my hand applying for traditional call centers like Maximum Research, BR Interviewing... etc. Those are traditionally sales and/or those political survey interviews, and a lot of people these days think you're calling to scam. Some people simply just won't do them, and they got this quota... I just got denied by BR Interviewing.

&#x200B;

I was looking on this sub and found Workbrite. Is that basically like Indeed but for exclusively WAH jobs? What do you get with a subscription? I assume you keep the subscription as long as you're still looking for a job/haven't been hired?

&#x200B;

I'm all for call center work, but give me a job working for, say, tech support helping people with their Spotify questions or something, I don't know how I feel about that survey stuff. Chat support agent also sound appealing from WOrkbrite. A support job where I don't have to actually talk to people on the phone sounds nice. I'm not against talking to people on the phone, mind you.

&#x200B;

So Workbrite is one site but if anyone has any other suggestions feel free to chime in here."
"I've seen some people say they've had success with finding remote positions. I would prefer to work from home and have been regularly checking LinkedIn among other sites for such work to not much avail. 

As far as my background goes I have:

-An English degree.

-3.5 years of teaching English in Japan. (I've looked into teaching online, but it wouldn't be enough to pay rent and my experience with the one company I applied to wasn't that great).

-JLPT N3 Certification (conversational Japanese which hasn't amounted to much success in job hunting obviously though I have gotten a few interviews because of it and other experience.)

-Almost two years working as an office admin/data entry/IT support (current job).
 
-Experience hosting my own podcast, managing multiple blogs (personal projects), and SEO optimization via targeting long-tail keywords and the like. 

I feel like there has to be something out there I can do. One thing I want to avoid are really bad call centers. Having worked in a bottom-feeding cesspit of a call center in tech support before it was hell in the office and I couldn't imagine the hell it would be working from home. 

That said, I technically work at a call center right now (though it doesn't feel like one) so I know good ones exist... but finding one is like looking for a needle in a haystack of needles.

Any thoughts on agencies that might be able to assist with my venture?"

"Hey r/Workonline! I'm the Chief Operating Officer at 4PC and a long time redditor. [The last time we hired off Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/comments/30y3zi/were_hiring_at_4patientcare_awesome_remote_jobs/) it worked pretty well, so we're back again! Check us out at [4PatientCare.com](http://4patientcare.com)

&nbsp;

We are currently hiring for the role of Technical Support Agent for our medical SaaS company (we are looking for multiple people for this position). Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

&nbsp;

A little about us: we pride ourselves in a laid back, yet incredibly self-disciplined culture. Because our team is spread out all over the country (and sometimes world), there's a high level of autonomy involved in all positions. This is a place for people who are willing to take on any challenge that comes their way. ""That's not in my job description"" is not a phrase we believe in. We're more of an ""I'll figure it out!"" kind of team. Transparency and honest communication are highly valued, and we're constantly looking for new ways to improve. We are co-workers, friends, nerds, and gif experts. We are the Dream Team.

&nbsp;

What you can expect:

* Starting pay is $16/hour while in training. The initial training period is a minimum of 90 days. Once out of training, pay increases to $18/hour.

&nbsp;

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively.
* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art?
* A knack for staying organized. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day?

&nbsp;

Basic Requirements:

* Must be a US citizen.
* Must be fluent in English
* Must have a computer and a working Internet connection.

Okay, back to the Technical Support Agent. Your role will be entirely remote, but does require full-time hours (35-40/week).

What we're looking for:

* People with a lot of individual agency and the ability to self-manage effectively. We do not micro-manage and we do not hand-hold. We strike a balance between giving enough training and direction so that you're not totally in the shark tank without a life vest, but oftentimes it'll be up to you to be proactive to problem-solve and get. things. done. If you're lost and without a map, do you wait for someone to notice and show you the way or do you actively reach out to get the direction you need to move forward?

* A natural curiosity and a strong desire to learn. Do you thirst for knowledge and yearn to explore the unknown? Do you like to know how things are put together and what makes them tick?

* The ability to roll with the punches in a dynamic work environment. Do you welcome change and thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing setting?

* Solid verbal and written communication skills. Do you have an excellent phone-side manner? Are your emails a work of art? Is an upset client someone you fear or just another opportunity to turn someone's frown upside down?

* Strong organization skills and attention to detail. Do your lists have lists? Can a spreadsheet make your day? Can someone throw ten tasks at you with specific instructions for each and trust that everything will get done and get done right?

"Hi all,

Right now, I work a normal 9-5 office job in email marketing but my social anxiety gets in the way sometimes, so I think a remote position would be most ideal for my condition. Do you guys know where I might be able to find these types of jobs? My background is mostly in email marketing and analytics. Thanks!

Our latest issue of our Newsletter focused on remote jobs [https://remotists.substack.com/p/first-108-remote-opportunities-from](https://remotists.substack.com/p/first-108-remote-opportunities-from?r=97ulh&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=reddit) Tell us what you think :)
"Hello, I wanted to ask if anyone has any ideas or suggestions maybe for some remote jobs like call center or live chat or moderation or maybe just any kind of jobs that one can apply from Asia or specifically india and require just basic fluent English or maybe some kind of basic specific trainings and stuff that one can take on to apply and work from home. 

I've looked into quite a lot of jobs and companies both local and international, but the local one's pay like 2$ an hour and then the international mostly western ones which are hiring, even when are remote require you to be from a US state. 

My capabilities, well I just finished my high school with science subject(PCMB) and I'm very fluent in English. I've currently applied to uni's and I'm waiting for the offers which I believe I can get as I do indeed have some seriously good grades and for the employment I'm more than willing to learn or take on some trainings for some remote jobs that atleast pay like 12-15$ an hour.

So, Please if you have any recommendations for companies or jobs which either you have worked for or heard of or maybe are working for at the moment. Can you name them below and I'll do my research and try n apply!
                                     
 Thank you, Have an amazing day!"
"I don't have a software engineering degree so that likely disqualifies for a lot of high paying remote work. I would be at entry level for any IT type roles in terms of on paper experience but I think I know a fair amount more than just the average person. I'm not above roles that would just get my foot in the door.

I never get responses back from entry level remote IT roles. Or most remote positions that don't involve micro-tasks.

 Should I ""dequalify"" my self on my resume? I don't want to give too much personal info about myself but should I remove my job titles for things like ""Senior Operation Engineer? I don't want to discuss more about my current industry  to minimize any personal information."
"**Before you tell me to be careful or that I'm doing something illegal,** don't worry, I can do whatever I want at my current job as long as I do the work that's required of me that day. My bosses have literally come over to tell me something while I was playing video games or watching Netflix and they don't give a shit. I'm also alone 85% of the time except for the maintenance workers. So seriously, don't worry about it.

- Goal: Earn $100+/week while also working my current job.
- Hours: Preferably less than 20, but open to any as long as it works out.
- Days: Preferably during the day, anytime between Wed-Sun. Mon/Tue negotiable depending on the job.

Now, the only things I couldn't do would be take phone/video calls because at my current job one of my main tasks is answering the phone. Beyond that, the sky's the limit.

I've tried micro jobs and stuff listed on r/beermoney, but it's pathetic. Taking surveys, transcription, watching ads.....I make like $5/day, *maybe*. I got rejected from Allegiant and mTurk, two of the few micro jobs that seem to actually pay ok. I can type 70-90wpm.

I've been scouring Indeed and Craigslist, and actually made an honest attempt at filling out my LinkedIn profile for the first time. I thought I could easily get a remote **Customer Service** gig, but they all seem to be either Sales jobs disguised as CS jobs, or require answering phone calls. I've looked into Live Chat CS gigs but they don't seem to exist, except in conjunction with phone/video calls.

I'm already in the process of working on something that might bring passive income, but that probably won't give me more than 3 figures per month, *if* that. It might not ever bring me money but we'll see (it also won't be implemented until a couple months from now). So I'm racking my brain trying to figure something out while still applying to the odd CS/Assistant job I can find that seems to fit what I'm looking for. 

Any other ideas would be helpful, thanks!"

"Hello!

I am a 3rd year (Junior year) CS undergrad student from Bangladesh ( South Asia). So please keep that in mind while giving advice.

I am looking for a remote Junior web developer role that pays a minimum of $6/hour. I have applied to many remote positions through LinkedIn and Angel.co (around 200) but I have not had any luck so far.

So I was wondering if it is actually possible to land a junior remote position from outside the US. And if it is possible, what can I do to land such a Job and what am I lacking?

Here is a brief introduction of myself:

I am Junior React developer with full-stack M/PERN (MySQL/MongoDB/PostgreSQL,Express.js, React.js, Node.js) experience. I have used Typescript (type safety for Javascript) and Git (for version control) extensively along with frontend libraries like Material UI, Tailwind CSS, React router, React Query, and Storybook.

In the back end, I worked with the Prisma ORM (for talking to the database), Zod ( for Typescript-based schema validation), and Postman (for API testing).

I have also used Python for Machine Learning and Deep learning with Scikit learn and Tensorflow libraries respectively.

Thank you for reading and I look forward to your responses."

Ex"" looks like the desktop did not allow the application ? To authorize, has been blocked . Is their away around this?

"Everyone on here says you should learn to program and learn SQL and web development and then jobs will fall from the sky.  
  
I'd say at this point I'm very comfortable with web development, I know python, how to make APIs with django, I've built a full stack site with django and react, and have played around with react native but I just don't know how to get a job.  
  
I have one completed site hosted on heroku and another api for a fitness app I plan on finishing (the api is finished not the react native app that will use it).  
   
I feel confident as a programmer and web developer. There's a ton for me to learn still but I know I'm more than good enough for an entry level position. 

Currently I am writing on upwork full time but I want to switch to web development because I love coding. I just don't know how to get a job in it.

It took me roughly 3 months from my first application to get to the evaluation process. I assume this is because of how they schedule training.

Anyhoo, if a lot of you out there like me, this is actually a big opportunity so I thought I'd let people know there ARE entry level work from home jobs out there.

"Hey everyone:

I am looking to work online.  The only working experience I have is 17 years of fast food restaurant experience.  However with situations that are happening right now, it's not safe for me to work with the general public.  I'm not a huge people person so sales jobs would not be an ideal fit for me.  I am currently going to college to obtain a degree in computer support specialist, however my passion is the actual building and repairing of computers.

If not, would love to hear from fellow Europeans who have studied to become a bookkeeper and where they have studied online (and if any certifications) and also if they have found work online?

"I just received a phone interview invitation from sitel to work in technical support full time for John Lewis (UK brand), is it better to take this or work as an independent contractor for a call centre, like Arise/NextRep/LiveOps? 

I feel like they would be more ideal, I don't particularly need money as this is my first real job and I live with my parents who are happy to support me. I could choose my own hours, so I wouldn't have to work on this full time (which people say is mentally draining, working in a call centre) and I could dedicate my time to other independent contractor work I would enjoy (writing mills like contentgather or textbroker).

The only disadvantage I see is that independent contractor work may not be taken as seriously as actual employment on my resume (although my total earnings could be verified in employment checks)."
"In between jobs right now. Really almost broke broke as in no money at all. Does anyone have suggestions on places where I could get a remote tech support job? Preferably they would be able to hire me quickly, as well as appreciate my degrees and experience and compensate me on the higher side of the range, preferably with flexible hours so I can continue my search for a full time role. 

I understand I'm not going to find anything that is perfect which is to say I understand there will be tradeoffs between qualities so I'm interested in hearing various options you guys can spit at me, making a short list, then reconsidering various aspects. 

Thanks guys."
Does anyone know of any legit remote jobs you can do from home that don't require a startup cost?
"Hi!

As many people now, I lost my income due to the corona crisis. I am student and mostly my parents were helping me financially, so I don't have really any professional experience (apart from part-time jobs like food delivery). I am studying computer science and learned some C, but it's probably too basic to get any job. Is there anything I can do? 

I feel like for remote jobs there is an extremely high entry level (full degree in the field, years of experience). I thought about something related to social media or customer service, cause it seemed fairly easy to get in without previous working experience and... no. Still need associated degree or experience.

For most research / survey / similar stuff there are not a lot of offers in my region. I registered and applied for many jobs via upwork and few similar websites (mostly transcriptions, virtual assistants, data entry), didn't get any of them.  I am kinda desperate, as I have problems to find a job in my region and I hope that remote job will be a life saver. Do you have any tips for me where to look? What kind of jobs can I do remotely without experience? Maybe you know some companies that are willing to hire students, even for (paid, even low, but paid)  internship or something?"
"As the title says, I'm currently trying to find a new job, and because of my disabilities (anxiety. depression, autism) it's hard for me to work normal hours at a day job out of the house. I currently have a job, but at the moment I'm barely getting any hours and mainly living off of my disability which isn't all that much. I have a Creative Writing degree, and a couple years of office work experience under my belt from my current job. I can write very well, and type over 90wpm. Most of the online jobs however I've found tend to lead to those scummy survey websites and I have no desire to sit doing surveys for pennies I might not even get. 

Anyone have suggestions? I can do customer service work, but I'd rather not have to make phone-calls (gives me major anxiety)."
"Hey everyone,
Just wanted to share a little side project that I whipped up a couple weeks ago. [Remote-Jobs.io](http://remote-jobs.io/) is a remote work/jobs search engine that taps into Craigslist job postings from all over the world.

Back when I was freelancing + looking for jobs, I relied on WeWorkRemotely.com and RemoteOK.io for finding remote work. While I love both those sites, I still wanted to find more listings. After scouring the web, I quickly realized that Craigslist was an untapped goldmine of remote job opportunities. This is because employers will post ""telecommuting ok"" jobs in their own city's Craigslist site, and many qualified coders/designers from other cities never see those listings! Remote-Jobs.io solves this issue by allowing people to search every city of Craigslist for remote OK jobs.

Remote-Jobs.io will eventually evolve into a full-fledged remote jobs search engine that searches more than just Craigslist. This is only V1, but I'm sharing it because it's already quite helpful + it provides a new source of remote job listings that's currently not easy to access. I hope you enjoy it & I look forward to your thoughts!

"Hey there. I'm from Russia but I really would like to connect my life with English, hence why I would like to travel to America in the future. So for now I'm looking for a remote job in an American company. Currently I'm working as an English technical support worker at a Russian company. I work 12 hours, 2 days on and 2 days off. So I'm looking for a side job with a few hours on. I'd like call centers but it would be also great to find something like chat support or anything I could do while I'm working at a current job. Do you have anything in mind? Is there any resources I could lurk around with worldwide online job opportunities?

"Hey all, Im based in Florida and I am looking for a WFM position. I just moved here from NYC to help care for my grandparents, and every in person job ive tried so far has been a dud. I only have my HS diploma, as I havent had the time to work on getting my degree yet. But gaining some financial stability would get me to a point where I can focus on my education again.

I have years of experience in customer service, been a keyholder at most of my retail positions. Ive managed political campaigns for various state assembly members in NYC, so cold calling/sales is not hard for me at all. Its been frustrating having to downgrade and have jobs down here pay chump change for insane amount of labor. 

Ive never been payed below $13/hr in my life, so its a tough change. Some leads would help tons, thank you all in advance and good luck to others out here job hunting."
"I've been living here since November and lost my previous remote job once I updated my address to reflect my move. I've realized now that's because California has laws surrounding independent contractors. I hate it, but it is what it is. I can't do phone work because I have no quiet place to work from. I also only have a high school diploma and not many job related skills outside of data entry, customer service, and medical lab work. I have been trying to learn some new skills so I can start a career, but that's coming with its own set of difficulties and taking longer than I had hoped. I've been using mturk for a decade now but with the pandemic I can't really make much on it. Prolific surveys are paying most of my bills but I need an actual income. Any ideas? Thanks!"
"Hello, I'll make it simple.

1) I'm looking for a stable-remote job (full-time).  
2) I live in Greece.  
3) - I'm a musician. I have a degree in Music from one of the best music colleges in the world.   
\- Finding a stable job in my field is almost impossible.  
4) I'm fluent in Greek and English (lived, studied and worked in the US).  
5) Skills: I'm a tech savvy guy. I can work with Word, Excel, Premiere, Logic, Photoshop, Illustrator and computers in general. I can type fast, create music(obviously) and videos (I run a youtube channel with 7k subscribers). I'm also the most goal-oriented and driven person I know. I like learning new things and expanding my knowledge.

I'm pretty successful in what I do but not having a stable-safe job is a real burden. My goal is to find a remote job so that I can work on my music and on my business ideas more freely.   
I'm researching extensively. If anyone has an idea on what jobs could work for me, I'd love to hear from you.

thank you"
"Hello! So, not self-promoting here, but I have a few decades of proofreading experience in academic papers and would like to get back into it to pay rent. I've had a proofreading website for about five years now and I'm finally ready to try to get clients. I have WooCommerce, and PayPal, and I can accept credit cards (I'm in the U.S.). I've usually charged $30 an hour, but if you know proofreading you know that we actually charge by the word, not the hour, and we give a bid and a deadline beforehand. I need help reaching out to academic writers out there, but I don't know how to promote my site. Any suggestions? By the way, I already have one degree in political science and in a few months, I'll have a second degree in environmental science. After that, I want to go straight into a master's program, so that is why, being VERY busy with studies, I'd like to go back into proofreading. Or any kind of writing really. Thanks!!"

"Hi,

When you get a moment:

I have recently (past 10 days) been applying to a variety of remote data-entry jobs on ZipRecruiter and have gotten some considerable activity on them.

Question 1: how legit are these jobs? x/100: for every 100 posts, are 40% scams? 60%? 80%?

I can type at about 50-60 wpm and basically live in front of the computer (which is a disaster in all honesty, but the absolute truth). I get the notion from the correspondence that I have had with these ""organizations"" that some of these are ""scam-ish"". I.e., they want to contact you via the Signal messaging platform and are offering text-messaging interviews (i.e. no phone calls or Zoom introductions). The objective is 25 / hr, basic momentum cash flow. *Nothing more* at this time. Trying to start ""as low as possible"" behind the computer in a remote capacity to gain traction.

Question 2: is data-entry not the right move here?

Of course, this all may sound extremely naive, given the fact that I have been behind this machine for 20 years and have yet to truly earn behind it. That said,

Question 3: in your experience: where / what role is a solid place to start? (Tend to perform better with ""task-oriented"" type of work with limited talking; unsure if this is relevant or not.)

What are your thoughts? Any insight / advice / experience is greatly appreciated.

Best regards!"
"Hey, everyone! Don't know if I can do this since I'm new but I was reading through this reddit while going through my list of links I had saved for some places that hire remote workers, etc. I can't work with any of these companies since they either still don't accept hires from my state or require landline which I don't have in my current place, so I figured I'd dump the list somewhere that it may help someone else.

&#x200B;

I don't remember any of the information about the jobs I listed. Some are well-known companies, others I researched at the time I made the list, which was two or more years ago. So if you need to know anything about the jobs, read their sites and do your own homework.

"Hi

I have been working for Appen awhile, since 2017. But Covid years slowed things wayyyy down. Now things have only slightly picked up there, with microtasking in October & November. Still waiting on paid invoices for those, as I had to order a new card due to mine that expired back in early summer.

LLM gigs have been all the rage this year, & I want to try my hand at those. Did go thru some qualifying with Appen & a few of their competitors for those. Some didn't let me quite pass their quizzes. Others if they passed have not loaded tasks yet. They say in 2024 they'll begin, but me like many others keep getting strung along with promises of work, that never seems to come! (Next Week, Next month, etc. they say -- but that time comes & goes & STILL, NO WORK )

And I also love to scout spammers in social media -- in a DIRE need of a gig doing that, I'm great at doing that!! Because not only do I Report/Block/Delete -- I'll take it a step further & send the contact info (if I can find it, researching where the accounts are from, or where the IPs & MAC addresses are found) & send that to law enforcement authorities!

Before you advise - please read this first! --

I tried freelancing sites before (Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer etc. ) & those never got me any customers.. 

I tried UHRS & MTurk microtasking recently too, these are only worth pennies apiece & their screeners never get any paid work. 

I've done the surveys things as well, which screeners mostly disqualify me for almost everything. 

I tried playing games for side hustles, those were all scammers too! Most once you reached the payout threshold - had blocked me from getting them, EVERY. TIME.

I JUST WANT A FUN REMOTE JOB that pays well - something worth the several hours per day put in, that I'll enjoy -- NOT SCAMMERS PLEASE & THANKS !!"

"Good morning,

I'm 27 years old and currently work as a physiotherapist, living in Paris although I'm Italian.

I would like some practical advice. I plan to stay in France for another five years to study osteopathy and save up money to buy a house in Italy. However, my goal is to have a 100% remote job that allows me to live anywhere in the world, working solely from a PC.

I aspire to a digital nomad lifestyle, and in these 5 years while I'll be in France, I'm willing to use my free time to acquire the necessary skills for such a job, which I know it will almost surely be in an unrelated field to mine. 

The job should be:

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.

. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated

. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study

. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

. As stress-free as possible

Which path should I pursue?

Thank you very much in advance for your insights, have a wonderful day"
" Hi! I landed a remote job in another country from indeed. they made an interview and sent me a contract. I feel the contract is pointless. we are in different countries and it has no stamps.

"Hi,

I'm working remotely for a tech international company (Ireland based). I'm under a contract with the company, so not self-employed, but the company don't care where I am based in Europe.

For the last 4 years, I'm based in Spain due to a relationship with a Spanish partner, but recently the relationship ended.

My Salary is quite high by European standards - 150K EUR a year, and I pay quite high tax in Spain (deducted automatically from my Salary), around 60K EUR tax a year,

**I thought that potentially I can move to another European country to lower the tax obligations, and from my new home, I can travel to different countries, etc.**

Few things to note:

\- I don't have an EU passport, I have only a Spanish resident (due to my relationship), so I can only go to places that give digital nomad visas or allow non-EU-passport holders to stay there.

\- Going outside the EU will be complex, because my company do have an entity in Europe, and if I'll move to another country, not in EUR, they will probably start re-negotiate the contract."

Last month I have lost my job and, because of the lock down to which Italy is subject due to the coronavirus, nobody conducts interviews.  I have, for years, carried out matched betting and I am registered on all hit portals (Amazon Mturk, Respondent, etc.) so don't answer whit this kind of website to earn money.

I am looking for a real remote job, preferably in the field of remote technical assistance (including underpaid job) that allows me to gain experience in the sector.  I can write about 80 words per minute in English and 100 wpm in Italian so I would also be interested in writing jobs, I can speak as native speaker both english and Italian too (and also rudimental spanish).

To improve my person I am attending a Duke University course about MySQL on Coursera, I would like to know MySQL very well within a year and all those tools that would allow me to have an extra skill to join in a company when I'll take the master's degree.  Therefore, I ask you if you know sites where I can find a job that meets these requirements and if any of you have any MySql online course (or anything else in the business field) that you would like to recommend.

"Professional video editing has also found its roots in the top freelance platforms where you can apply for online video editing jobs. These platforms enable you to apply and work online from your home.

To increase your chances of landing a remote job, its better if you create a portfolio or a detailed resume with details of your previous projects. Usually with these websites, you have to compete with other professionals to secure a job. Therefore, communication skills play a big role in winning a project bid.

Here is the list of the platforms where you can find such work:

* **90Seconds**: An online platform for digital artists where you can apply as a video creator, editor or film producer. Payments are made through their own **Hyper Wallet** gateway.
* **Mandy.com**: One of the most popular platforms for video professionals. They offer freelance jobs in film, theater, video creation, editing and other commercial music work. Workers are paid directly by the employers.
* **Upwork**: The most popular freelance platform also has a separate category for freelance video editing jobs. Payments are made via **Paypal**, **Payoneer** and **Wire Transfer**.
* **VideoPixie**: Another freelance platform dedicated for video professionals only. You can apply as a videographer, film maker, screen writer, producer, sound engineer etc. Payments are made via **Paypal**  and **ACH**.
* **TheCrewingCompany**: It's a UK based online platform that hires professional video editors to work for them. You can apply to work on site or remote. Payments are made after 21st of each month.

Do share you experiences with these platforms if you've had any. It might help others land a job.

Edit: More details about these platforms and their links can be found in this [Guide](https://www.webemployed.com/online-video-editing-jobs-websites/)."
"Many across the globe have started understanding and making the most of remote work trends which was not the case before. However, until the past year, the entire thought of working from home probably sounded weird to many employers.  


It's not the case anymore. [Check out these stats](https://www.resourcifi.com/blog/remote-work-trends-2020/)!"
"Do you yearn for an intellectually stimulating job without the over-stimulation of life in the US, SA and around the world?

Have you had a taste of working from home and are ready to trade in your suit and office commute for pajamas and Zoom meetings?

There are so many reasons why remote work can be a transformative experience for employees and employers alike: from increased productivity and flexibility in where you live to more time with loved ones.

Yet, with all those benefits comes new challenges to overcome. New ways of communicating, new technologies, and distributed time-zones to name a few. While organizations learn how to manage remote work policies, people looking to go remote need to focus on standout skills to get noticed in a global applicant pool.

So what skills should you focus on to stand-out and land that dream remote job?



TECH-SAVVY

Basic understanding of technology is the new barrier to entry for remote working even if you do not have a tech-focused job. Everyone is tired of one of the top questions of 2020 ""Can you hear me now?"" when logged on Zoom, or having to even explain what Zoom is to begin with.

To execute work effectively in a remote environment you need to feel comfortable using the appropriate tools.

How can I improve?

Common tools to get familiar within the remote landscape include Zoom, Slack, Notion, and Asana. Choose a few favorites and start moving your personal life into these tools. For example, you can create an Asana to manage your To-Do Lists and use Slack to connect with friends and family. Remember practice can go a long way when getting comfortable with new technology.

If things like 2FA and VPN are gibberish to you, brush up on your knowledge of privacy and security online. Creating strong passwords and downloading a password manager is a great starting point.

How can I show this skill off?

Add the tools you are most comfortable using to your LinkedIn profile and CV. Consider sharing your work in a public Notion, acting as a portfolio of your accomplishments. Ask about the tools and tech stack at the companies you are interviewing for.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS

Without the chance of running into your colleague at the coffee machine, or the subtleties of decoding a smile and a smirk, your virtual communication becomes critical.

As communication moves asynchronously, it is important to focus on written communication skills to increase readability of your messages.

How can I improve?

Learn your communication style, and considr ways you can flex to other styles. Start writing messages with a work context in mind. Record yourself on video calls and analyze ways to become more relaxed and engaging on camera.

How can I show this skill off?

From initial contact to final interview, you have many opportunities in the hiring process to stand out. Check that your written messages are concise. Share the most important information, and set clear expectations on next steps. Be authentic during video interviews and let your personality shine through!

TIME MANAGEMENT

Balancing work and kids, pets, and time zones can be a challenge for remote workers. Without the commute to break up the workday it is easy to let work expand into more hours of your day. An effective remote worker is an efficient remote worker. By prioritizing productivity over hours in front of a screen you can accomplish your goals with more time back in your week.

How can I improve?

Create a time management diary. List your top priorities, and all other tasks and meetings. Analyze your estimated time to complete, and your actual time to complete. Over time (pun intended) you will begin to see what traps you are falling victim to. From there, you can plan a schedule to complete your most important and urgent activities first.

How can I show this skill off?

When emailing with Hiring teams share your availability and time zone. Communicate expected turnaround time for your responses. Share examples of work you have completed with dispersed teams. During interviews discuss your approach to scheduling in focus time, meetings, etc.

"I just had my interview yesterday and was hired.  I put my application in at the beginning of August so it takes awhile.

You have to meet their PC requirements as well as hardwire your internet while working and have a headset.

It's part time and the pay is $12 an hour.  She also worked with me for the hours I'm available so I start in the morning after i take my kiddo to school and stop in time to pick him up as well as being available all day on the weekends.

It helps if you have previous telephone customer service experience, as well as knowing how to troubleshoot your PC if something is wrong with it. They may have also taken into account that i have previous experience working from home."

I need a job because I have recently lost the one that I had. 
I have applied to 5CA now and did their test, waiting for the reply. But I would like to explore other options, I also work with teemwork.ai sometimes, but the projects are like once a month.

"Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm really having the good leads on an employer that would want to take under their wings a person like me. I am someone who's desperately looking for home-based jobs but I'm not someone who's a developer or great in sales or marketing. Since I do not have the experience, probably some employers are not open to newbies like me, but I can prove that I'm a fast learner and I'm really enthusiastic in doing my job. I do know some skills there, such as SEO link building as I was a content writer for the past few weeks of being a freelancer but a lot of sketchy and short-lived jobs have been given to me. I was actually a corporate worker for 3-4 years and recently, I quit my job to have a better and healthier environment. For my work experience I was a Researcher Analyst, a Compliance Assistant, an Administrative Assistant and I've been in the Customer Service industry for 6 months (non-voice/email support) for a gaming account.

&#x200B;

I really am open to any legit work that does not involve paying for training or something else and as much as possible would not require a noise-cancelling headset because at the moment, I don't even have the money to buy one. I am hoping someone could really give me leads to data entry or virtual assistant work that doesn't involve calling that much. I've already been to a lot of freelancer sites but sadly, I still don't have a job. Here are some of the sites I've already tried:

RatRace

Upwork

Onlinejobs

AngelList

&#x200B;

I've also tried LionBridge and Appen but I'm waiting on that but I'm hoping for more recommendations as well. I also am from the Philippines so I think it narrows down the search.

&#x200B;

If anyone wants to train me for any work ( even if it involves sales or marketing) or let me test a program that you've done and could pay me for quality testing then I'll be willing to do that too.

&#x200B;

Hopefully, someone can help me because I'm desperately needing money as this will help me in the future."
"I'm looking to leave the rat race and work from home. I'm currently a System and Network Administrator and I have over 12 years of experience. 

My goal is to do consulting work remotely, with the possibility of traveling a small percent of the time as needed. My family and I would like to move to the Northeast, so if needed, I could travel to a city like NYC or Boston in a few hours. We'd be living out in the country.

**That being said, my question is this:** Does anyone know of a good recruiting company, head hunter, or job placement service that is specialized *specifically* in remote work? I've found sites like SkipTheDrive, weworkremotely, etc, but I want to be sure I'm looking at all of my options.

Any help is appreciated!

"So, I finally have a job that's livable wage and even better it's work from home. There's drawbacks in that I'm an independent contractor, but for the next two years or so, it should work for me. 

I do have one question though. So, my shifts are generally traditional M-F 9-5. And today is my first day. And I've never worked remotely before. My boss had called and said he'll be sending some emails throughout the day to go through what to download and things like that...but I really have nothing going on until 1.

My question is, am I on the clock right now? For those hours 9-1 when all I'm really gonna do is a few downloads here or there? They stressed these shifts, I'm just wondering if they'll like only pay me for my training from 1-3, or if I'm on the clock fully. Surely I'll be busier when I'm fully on boarded but I am expecting since I'm here at home and available that I'll be paid for this time? 

Any clarification helps!"

After lots of hard work, I'm happy to share the new site!

If you're looking for a job in customer support - that is 100% remote, check out [Remote Report](https://remote.report)! There are 85+ jobs, 15 of which I just added in the past 12 hours! 

If you're curious about what types of roles are posted or what ""support focused"" means: roles will range from Customer Success, Customer Support, Technical Support, Support Engineer all the way to Director of Operations. The common theme is that the jobs are focused on supporting customers in some way, be it through simple service or more technical roles.

Does the same apply to online jobs? I've applied, gotten the obligatory ""we've got your application message"" and now I'm waiting and applying to more. Ive noticed some of the jobs from a month ago Ive applied to still have the postings up.

What's the usual experience here when it comes to online? Just wondering, at least for customer services jobs and the like."
"Hello, I'm looking for a remote job where I could make at least around 1000 euros per month. Mostly I am looking for some customer support jobs, like answering with emails or chats. I worked like that for Epic Games, but not directly, with the outsourcing company.

My skill set is narrow, but very sharp: I am a music producer, sound engineer and designer, mixing and mastering engineer.  This is my main path and if I could find something related to this I would be extremely happy. 

I am good with troubleshooting computers, software issues etc. Also, I have more than 3 years of experience of working in sales. From regular sales manager to Head of sales department in a rival company, but I'm not looking for sales job. I want something with less money, but also with less stress.

I have tried some stuff, like surveys, but the most I could make there were couple of euros. I have applied for few remote job positions as well, for example cyberbacker, but they told me that my desired salary is higher than they can provide, I did ask what they can provide and they did not even answer :) 

I also do some stuff in photoshop, after effects, premiere pro, but I don\`t think that I\`m on that level when people would pay me for that."

" I plan to start businesses and provide online income opportunities throughout the COVID19 disruptions by partnering with people who can provide services that will sky rocket in demand. In this post I will outline the types of opportunities and timeline for these becoming available.

**Week 1 - 2:** Commission based jobs for people who can generate clients for products and services.

This sort of business is easy to run since the costs of paying you come from the profits of the business. This makes the time to launch much quicker. Income opportunities can be offered without any risk on my part. When you help to make money you are paid a commission on that. Some commissions may be recurring depending on the nature of the product/service.

**Week 3 - 4:** Paid to post jobs.

Low paying jobs that will help the promotion of new businesses. These will pay fixed incomes but they will not be that much. Through this time the businesses aim to build up client bases/cash flows to become self sustainable, so overheads need to remain low.

**Week 5 - 6:** Customer service and community management jobs.

By mid month two some income from the efforts of weeks one and two should be starting to show and there will be more available for staffing. At this point better fixed income jobs will be available. These will be paid at whatever rate is viable, so it may start lower but increase as business picks up.

**Week 7 - 8:** Content production and brand ambassador jobs.

By now the fundamental systems to run the business well should be in place. An upgraded version of the paid to post jobs can be offered. This will pay people to produce content (blogs/videos/images/etc) for ongoing brand awareness promotion. These jobs will be paid with a basic rate with performance bonuses on top.

**Week 9 - 10:** Managerial roles.

Hopefully by this point there is too much going on to personally oversee all areas. If there is, there should be a decent amount of cash flow available for advanced jobs. Supervisor role, HR and project management sort of positions will become available. These will also be paid at a rate that is viable, so may start lower. The initial time for this would be a training period and then rate of pay increasing as you become self reliant in the position.

**Week 11 - 12:** Depends on what's happening.

This is around the time we may start to get indications of how bad the real effects from COVID19 may be. In an optimistic scenario around this time things may be difficult but there will be an end in sight and normality can resume. Beyond the virus itself the economic issues caused by all that has occurred could take a lot longer to get back to normal.

It is easier to bail out an immediate problem then work out an underlying problem, and it is easier to close a business than open one. If businesses are unable to open the job market is going to swamped. Supply/demand can lead to lowering of wages and it being far harder to get these lower wages. This may be the start of harder times which can be more enduring.

I hope this does not happen, but it is possible. So while I hope for better I am going to start to prepare to be in a strong position if this the case in a few months time (A long time. Remember a month ago it was all okay?). If unemployment gets high I should be able to set up various ""Get paid to"" type of online incomes which I will run at break even to offer maximum income for as long as is required.

If things improve after only a short period of time there will be some changes to some businesses, as is required, but they will still continue to run. So ongoing income opportunities are available in any case.

I have to be a bit vague on the products and services the businesses will offer at this point since many of the things I am looking at doing are relying on partnerships. I am still doing due diligence to ensure quality of things before making any decisions on what to go with. I'll elaborate on this as things move on.

The time-line for the launch and building of these businesses is a tight one. Ideally things would be a bit more spaced out, but everything is happening right now. Working fast and hard for a good solution today is better than an excellent one next week. Much of the success of this will hinge on me finding good people to work with to power stage one (commission sales). Focused, driven and determined people that make things happen. I'm one of these people and I know there are others out there. Those who help me get this going I will reward disproportionately when things pick up.

The effects of COVID19 on the future job market are at this time hard to predict, but bad could easily turn into terrible. I'd urge those of you who have the wherewithal to create jobs for people to begin to work on doing that. For those who are out of work, it'd be a good idea to work on improving skill sets that will make you more valuable to online business owners."
I've been contemplating working from home as a CPA. I tried looking for remote jobs but none appear to pay that well compared to a brick and mortar firm. I'm contemplating consulting work but I know that will take a while to build business and I need to leave my firm to avoid the non-compete agreement. I have a growing family too so financial security/health care are important. I'm wondering if anyone has successfully done this and can give me some pointers?
" 

I  have tried freelancing in Upwork. I  got rejected and in freelancer, I  am not getting clients and yes, I am  building a portfolio website with a  lot of testimonies, both video and  text for increasing trust.I  suppose, this portfolio website can be great  for getting a remote job  too.

I  have emailed companies  which posted job offers from LinkedIn and also  I've emailed companies  with Google ads related to my niche, which is  tutoring but failed to  get any replies for some reason. Can anyone here  give me some tips to  get a remote job? Like where to search and how to  email and other  things I should remember to get a remote job?

Also, what is important in getting a remote job or any job for that matter? Degree or experience or certifications?

Thanks in advance."
"So I'm a software engineer from a third world country where the pay is very laughable. I want to seek the option of a remote job for a country with better pay than mine such as US, Europe, Canada...etc.

however due to the type of work i did over my career so far i have nothing to show for my work since the projects i have worked on are either internal or still in development and i also have an NDA preventing me from claiming them as my work anyway.

what I need advice about is what can i do to stand up for recruiters and where can i find possible postings for such jobs. I'm willing to take entry level and junior level jobs because even those pay significantly higher than what I earn and I'll be overqualified for such positions. i also don't mind part time jobs, i even prefer them over full time.

I'm not looking for an immediate position rather I'm looking to improve my chances for finding a job for the near future.

thank you all in advance for any suggestions or advices."

**Salary** From $45,000 a year

**Job Type** Full-time

**Number of hires for this role**1

## Qualifications

* Copywriting: 1 year (Required)
* US work authorization (Required)

## Full Job Description

**Copywriter**

Does this sound like you?

* You fall asleep with a book in one hand and a pen you use to fix typos in the other hand.
* Your friends accuse you of being the 'grammar police', and you say, 'No; I'm a grammar Navy Seal.'
* You take pleasure in making readers cry at your short stories, social media captions, and emails. Then, you make them laugh five seconds later.
* If you blindfolded one of your prolific readers and spun them around three times, the reader would still be able to pick out your article on the wall among hundreds of others articles just because your writing voice was that strong.

If you read this list and said, ""It's like they wrote my biography,"" then you might be the worthy one we've been looking for to lift Thor's hammer.

**Just One Dime** is made up of invested and talented people that are passionate about helping online entrepreneurs obtain financial freedom so they can do what they love with the people they love. Just One Dime is growing aggressively and needs writers to help grow our library of content.

Here's a sample of the qualities we value:

**Tested Skill**:  
We need a writer who has already gone through their growing pains. You've humbly received feedback from fellow writers and editors and applied it. You can learn more about our business and ecommerce, but you must already know how to write a compelling ad, email, script, and social media copy. And yet, you remain teachable.

**You Take Action**:  
If you don't know about any particular bit of being an online entrepreneur or how the industry works, then you will seek the answers out. If you have a problem, you will seek out the solution. To you, there are no dead ends.

**You Take Pride in Your Work:**  
When you send out any completed assignment, you can look at it and say, ""This represents how good of a writer I am."" To you, tasks are more than tasks; they're opportunities for you to make a statement about your skill. You take ownership of every bit of writing you do.

**Good Human**: We're building a team of people that respect each other, who build others up, are humble, teachable, and make us laugh. You must be able to take feedback with humility and a thick skin.

If everything you have read so far feels right and you meet the requirements below, let's talk.

**What We're Gonna Have You Do** (at least some of the things)

* Work directly with the Content Manager to produce marketing emails, blogs, scripts, social media captions, and more that will grab readers by the horns and keep their attention.
* Create opportunities for Just One Dime to expand its reach. When you write, you will think of all the ways we can repurpose the material in creative ways, so that we all work smarter, not harder.

**What You Already Bring to the Table** (at least some of the things)

* One to five+ years of marketing and copywriting experience with a strong emphasis on digital, social media (especially Youtube and Facebook), and email marketing. You might be able to sneak in with less paid experience, but then your portfolio better melt our faces off with how excellent it is.
* Experience in writing with a brand voice and the ability to chameleon your writing style from media to media.
* You make the attention to detail and organization of NASA scientists look like a joke.
* Strong time management and being able to juggle multiple tasks are a must.
* You're resourceful. If you don't know how to do something, you find out how.
* Savvy with Apple hardware, Google Docs, and project management software. You don't require any hand holding when it comes to technology.

"This came across my Twitter feed tonight, and I thought that it might interest some people here.

The city of Tulsa is offering $10,000 to remote workers willing to move to the city. There are other benefits, including:

* Free housing stipend for fully-furnished apartments in the heart of the city, plus utilities covered for 3 months
* Free co-working office space
* A local community ""designed"" to be supportive of remote workers

The requirements are:

* 18+ years old
* Eligible to work in the US
* Must be a full-time remote employee or self-employed outside of Tulsa County
* Can move to Tulsa within 6 months
* edit: Must be willing to live in Tulsa for at least 1 year

There also appears to be some sort of interview process involved, it's not an automatic approval.

For more information and to apply, [check it out](https://tulsaremote.com/#hero).

Personally, this seems to be targeted at those working in the tech industry, since remote workers are usually working in that sector. That makes sense, I know that Tulsa has been making a push to be more attractive for tech companies. I actually live 2 hours from Tulsa, so I'm sort of considering it.

I hope that this is a push for more cities to offer programs like this."
"I'm still looking into this and in discussion with the poster but always follow the if it's too good to be true, it usually is rule with posts on here. Paying $500 to an unlimited amount of people to ""remotely test"" a product and $150 per referral makes me skeptical. They also had to stress ""AT NO POINT WILL WE TRY AND SELL YOU ANYTHING!"" which usually means they will or your sensitive data is what's going to be for sale.

"Hi! I'm a girl from Portugal looking for a remote job where I could make around 900EUR per month.
I have a certificate in hospitality management and tourism.
Any ideas?"
"Scams are increasing at a high rate, especially while searching for a remote job. We, at [DailyRemote,](https://dailyremote.com/) are researching and writing a blog post about how to identify legitimate remote jobs and avoid scams. Read it [here](https://dailyremote.com/remote-work-blog/are-remote-jobs-work-from-home-jobs-scam/).

Be on a lookout for the following while searching for a job, and be cautious before accepting any offer:

* Check the company's contact information including phone number and physical address.
* Check out their website, LinkedIn and other social media accounts.
* See the company's reviews and ratings on Glassdoor.
* Any news and press coverage of the company.
* Try to network and interact with the existing employees of the company.
* Ask them for a video call interview, don't trust a facebook message or online chat.
* NEVER pay money upfront for the interview."
"Hello!

I applied for a job thinking it was remote (or at least partially remote). The office is 1.5 hours away from where I currently live, and I have laid my roots here and don't really have any interest in relocating. I applied for the job because despite there being no mention of whether it was remote or not in the description, it popped up under ""remote"" on Indeed.

I had an interview last week that I thought I blew. She mentioned the role being in office a few days a week but that they were still ironing out the details. She asked if I would be open to commuting. I said yes, but mentioned winter weather potentially being a challenge (we live in the mountains).

Anyway, I thought that was that because I wasn't feeling very confident. I'm now entering the second round of interviews this week, and I can't remember if they'll either make the decision after this or if I'll have a third interview.

I'm worried about wasting their time, knowing realistically I cannot commute more than 1-2 days a week. But at the same point, it is more of a mid-level, higher salary, role... with COVID I know I can expect to be working remotely at least for a few more months. 

Do you think this is something I could negotiate should an offer be put on the table? Or should I bring it up again in the interview?

For context: it would be a graphic design position. I can see needing to come in for some things like providing art direction at product photoshoots for example. The company is small (25 people) but they do have a few people that live out of state and work fully remote."
"My in-office (can't be done from home) job is hanging by a thread due to the pandemic. Does anyone know of companies that are actively hiring remote workers right now? I have experience with admin assisting, data entry, writing/editing, photo retouching, and graphic design. 

I know a lot of companies are on hiring freezes right now, so if anyone has any leads please list them below. Thank you!"

"Hey guys,  
   
I recently found a job online about a remote job for a company called Mixtiles. From the looks of it, it seems like a customer service, email answering type of position.   
   
Does anyone know anything about the company? Is it legit? I'm a bit skeptical because of their perfect rating on Glassdoor. Can't find anything about it here on Reddit otherwise.

Thanks! "
"*(TL;DR version: I need a new job, but am feeling hopeless and am afraid of scams or anything not worth my time)*

I would like to apologize in advance if this post is a bit strenuous to read through, my brain isn't working at 100% right now and I'm looking for some help from the great folks on reddit.

Without getting too in-depth into my mental health history, let me just say it has been a bit of a rollercoaster. I've been prescribed various antidepressants and other medications. I've been misdiagnosed in the past. I've undergone various therapies.

That being said, I've been a top-performing sales consultant (nationally) at a few retail positions that I've held the last decade. My metrics at all my previous jobs have been good enough to always earn a raise come time for a review. My point being, I am a good and hard worker. I achieve and often exceed expectations. I know I can be a strong person.

But my brain doesn't let me enjoy a good thing for too long. It never does.

I've been struggling really badly for about two months now, and had already been considering going back on antidepressants prior to today's events.

Today, for the first time ever in my life, I had a severe mental breakdown at my new retail job, spoke with a manager, and quit with one hour remaining in my shift. I was already feeling overwhelmed from lack of any training of any kind and that I needed to ask so many questions. The straw that broke the camel's back was right at the beginning of my shift when one of the managers I had never met or heard of located me on the salesfloor, and began to unprofessionally scream commands at me, out of nowhere, while I was 10min into my shift and already doing the task that *my* direct manager had asked me to do while I was clocking in. I continued to work, now on this new task, feeling completely embarrassed, completely worthless, disposable, etc. My brain was telling me to walk out right away, but I thought I could last my whole shift. I was wrong, and now I have no job.

I have a 120-hour TEFL certificate, but no classroom experience.

I have a passion for writing, but have no academic achievements in the field nor any experience in writing as a job.

I've done transcription online and enjoyed it, but found I was spending hours upon hours of work for a quarter of what my province's hourly wage is.

I have interest in voice acting but also have no experience.

I seriously can't think of much else right now but I've also tried a few ""task-worker"" sites but none seemed to pay enough to cover any of my bills (if the site even offered CAD payouts). I'm at a loss and can't deal with scrolling through a list of sites that might all not be worth my time.

Basically, I'm broken and can't do retail anymore. I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow and moving forward with my health as best as I can. I love to work. I need to work. I just need a human response for my problem and was hoping I might find someone here who knows of any opportunity I might want to check out right away."
"I am a 25 years old female who lives in a remote area in the US. I speak fluent Cantonese (mother tongue), mandarin and English.

"Due to the pandemic, the city I'm living in has ordered lockdown so my entire team has to work from home. And so I'm looking for tools to help us collaborate more efficiently. Currently I'm trying the current 3:

1. Skype: for team communication and video call if we really need it. Normally our team does not need to call much, but we may need to do so in the future for interview. My friend also recommended Zoom but honestly I'm not sure how different it is compared to Skype.
2. Todoist: to make my own to-do list. I've been trying this one out and so far it seems great. The interface is quite easy to use and I can connect them between my phone and laptop. Unfortunately its task Reminder feature is locked behind Premium package... which I'm not exactly need all of features included in it.
3. Trello: it works quite fine for now as project management tool. Its free plan is pretty generous, making it suitable for small teams like ourselves. Still I would hope to get more recommendations regarding project management.

I bet that there are many other tools I have not tried out yet. Probably this is not the right place to post this kind of question but still it's better to ask rather than doing nothing. So if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

Thank you in advance!"

"Hello there,  


I have been surfing through this thread for a while, trying to find the best thing that may suit me. Having said that, most of the websites that have been on top of the suggestion list so far are mainly made for those living in the US, the UK or some other European countries. It is even more super frustrating that even though some are proved to be an online job, yet after I completed filling in my personal details and doing some free training tasks, I figured out myself that there is actually nothing much to do based on my current location.

So yeah, as you can already guess, I am Asian and to be more specific, I am living in a SEA country. Please kindly give me some more recommendations on what I could take a look at. These are the websites that I have already done:  


**- Appen:** Appen is so weird for me.  It keeps sending out quite a few Emails reminding me of the available positions once in a while, yet even though I passed that round and also tried to apply for the opening projects, I have never heard anything from them. It is really difficult to reach out for them by Emails (I have no idea whether there are any other ways to contact them). I  technically give up on this site.  


**- UserTesting, TrymyUI, Test Worker:** I am qualified for all of them, yet it seems that there has been no tasks that really fit my database YET. I can see that there are so many people earning a lot out of them, so I am still giving some hope.  


**- Mturk, Microsoft Rewards, Prolific:** Sadly, they are not available in my area."
"This first year of working completely online has been educational. Not only learning what jobs are out there, but also which jobs I excel at. By far, I've learned that I'd much rather edit and turn other people's pieces of work into eloquently crafted and polished copy than write it myself.

Most, if not all, of the sites I have seen suggested on here are for writing the content, not editing. Just curious if anyone knows of any sites that recruit editors? I'm more than happy to go through an application process, but I will NOT consider sites like Upwork. Looking for fairly consistent work from one or more sites, kind of like content mills for editors. There's got to be a lot of demand for this type of work out there, specifically in English.

Anyone know if anything like what I'm describing exists?"

"I saw a post about a newcomer to the remote tech support scene and there was a lot of interest about it, so I figured I'd post this as well.

[Loyal Techs](https://www.loyaltechs.com/techs) (not a referral link) is a Boston-based startup that connects local and remote technicians to people looking for help with their technology. Most of the local work is hardware-related (e.g. setting up wi-fi or a printer) whereas the remote work is, out of necessity, software (e.g. install Microsoft Office for me, virus removal, etc.). The pay is 20+ bucks an hour so, although it won't make you rich, it's not a bad side gig. 20 hours a month nets you 300 bucks, minimum.

**Edit**: Here's a better breakdown of pay*:

**$15**/hr for Data Backup/Transfer

**$37.50**/hr for Software Install/Uninstall

**$56.25**/hr for New Computer Setup

**$60**/hr for Network Setup/Troubleshoting

You don't have to have a formal educational or professional background in tech. As long as you're the unofficial tech in all your family and friends' lives, you'll do just fine.

You get to work whenever you want, no set hours. Everything is through the app, from getting notifications of available jobs to accepting them to getting paid for them. It's available both on iPhone and Android.

Hey there,

I am seeking to hire approx. 80 inbound call center representatives. The job is fully remote, legitimate, no commissioned sales or sales of any kind, cold calling or outbound calls. Laptop will be mailed to you to use.

You will work M-F, 8am to 5pm. Hours are strict. No weekends. All government holidays off. Pay increase after 90 days, which will also include full benefits plus 401k. You will be working for the government, going over state medical plan prescription benefits.

Full/paid training.  You coworkers are nice, not a lot of micro-managing, you can schedule time off for appointments, days off, etc, with plenty of growth opportunity.

If you are interested, please reach out to me as I am hiring ASAP. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY. Don't waste my time and I will not waste yours, okay?

DM me, tell me a bit about your background and work experience. If I like you, you are pretty much hired.

The following states are excluded from this current job role: California, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Montana, Washington, DC, West Virginia, Connecticut, Ohio, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Washington and Massachusetts.

EDIT for clarity:

Edit: I find it extremely odd that so many people have downvoted a legitimate job offer. So let's recap, for those who seem unable to understand or are making false accusations.

1. This is a temp to perm position. You are hired via temp agency for a temp-to perm job. Your temp position with the temp agency lasts 90 days. If the company you are temping for (this government project job, MMC, Inc.), sees that you show up on time, and do your job, you will get hired for a perm position. That's it. United States ONLY, and please read the states that are excluded. I am hoping to have at LEAST 20-30 people screened and ready to hire BY MONDAY. But I still need up to 80.
2. The reason I am pre-screening for my friend, the hiring manager for the temp agency, is because I do a somewhat similar role in a non-qualifying state. As such, I would like to at least be able to speak with the individual I am recommending for hire, and determine if their ""phone presence."" is nice enough. It's that easy.
3. You need to pass a background check. Don't apply if you know you can't. Again, this is a government contract job. You are pulling info such as address/social security numbers, etc. As such, we want to make sure you aren't doing anything shady with the info.
4. If I like you and I think you are a good candidate, I will forward your resume along with any other details to the hiring manager. If you want to go over the job in further detail, you can ask her.
5. Please, please please do not ask me if we can adjust your schedule, or let you work weekends, or come in later or earlier. We do not set up the schedules. You are working government hours. Strictly 8-5, no weekends.  If you can work that schedule from M-F, then let me know. Again, this is U.S only, some states are prohibited.
6. I do have a job for Cali (we need 80 reps, somewhat similar role), for a job starting in Nov, potentially, but I don't have more details until next weekish, maybe.

As it stands, I still will be speaking with each potential hire, should you be interested. To make it clear again, I am helping her find new hire reps. I don't get paid for this, and I will not be responding to rude behavior. If you think this is a scam, then congrats. You talked yourself out a legitimate job, and that isn't my problem."
I'm looking for something flexible and preferably online that I can work at on my days off to make some extra cash. I've seen lots of survey/ crowdsourcing sites but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that would suit my educational and professional background. Thanks!

"I've had conversations with professionals who work from home from all over the world so I could understand some of the struggles with sleep. From newcomers who are just getting started to seasoned veterans who have worked remotely for years, I've learned that there are some unique challenges with sleep. And as I continued to talk to more and more people who work online, I've discovered some patterns and common pain points with sleep.

# The flexibility of choosing when to work

One of the benefits of being a remote worker is flexibility around getting work done. For some, that can mean choosing their own hours or the location that they work from like a dedicated space in their home, a coworking center, or maybe a local coffee shop.

Here is how this flexibility was described in one conversation:

>""Because I can bring my work anywhere and anytime with me, I didn't follow a set schedule for work. Work can creep in even in family gatherings, dinners and even in bed.""

# Trouble with ""turning off""

With a regular 9 to 5, there is a distinction between when you are working and not working because you leave your home and go someplace to work. The commute can serve as a sort of time to decompress. When you work remotely from home, the lines of work-life balance can become blurred. 

Here is feedback from a remote professional about having trouble with winding down at night:

>""Running your own business and working from home requires a lot of discipline to avoid sleep issues. It is all too easy to stay up late, working on the computer, when the office is a few steps from the bedroom.""

# Unexpectedly waking up in the middle of the night

Waking up in the middle of the night occasionally is normal. Perhaps you drank a lot of liquids before bed, or maybe you had a stressful day. However, it becomes a problem when it starts to happen frequently where you are waking up exhausted the next morning from not sleeping well. The cycle becomes worst when you sleep in because you are tired, feel guilty from getting up late, and then work later and later to try to ""catch up.""

Here is how someone talked about this challenge:

>""I've been waking up almost every night around 3am, and I have trouble falling back to sleep, so I usually reach for my phone.""

# Recommendations on how to handle these challenges so you can sleep well

If you want to have restful sleep without feeling exhausted in the mornings, then one way to do that is to create a schedule as if you were working set hours such as a 9 to 5. The other part of this is being aware of how technology such as the blue light from screens can affect you and making some changes to reduce screen time at night.

\- Create a dedicated space in your home for work

\- Be intentional with your work schedule, so your hours remain stable from day to day

\- Use boundaries to avoid working on ""just one more thing"" late into the wee hours of the night, and so you have some personal time to relax

\- Enable night mode on your phone to minimize blue light after sunset. F.lux is a great option for your computer.

\- If you struggle with waking up in the middle of the night, then [try deep breathing for a few minutes](https://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/health-promotion-wellness/psychological-emotional-wellbeing/Combat-Tactical-Breathing.pdf) instead of reaching for your phone. Deep breathing also works for staying in control under stressful situations.

Keep in mind that this isn't all or nothing. 

It's a journey so start with changing a couple of things. Then move on to the others later on when you are ready. The strongest resistance and discomfort will happen across the first few days, and it's also the period in which most people give up. If you are serious about getting a good night's sleep and waking up refreshed in the mornings, then it's absolutely worth it.

**I'm curious, which one of these challenges have you had the hardest time with as a remote worker?**"
"I am not sure if this belongs here, but I have found a list of tools to build efficient workflow, provided by kinda big guy in the Middle East project management scene. Thought you guys might find it useful.

By the way, the guy is running a webinar this week, covering topics of the PMP program. It's a nice deal for those who would like to get prepared for the exam, as it costs only $50 instead of $500 PMI's cost. https://ppmwebinar.caseinpointco.com/

So here's the soft he recommends: 


Team Collaboration Software: Sucoco

Sucoco simulates a virtual office-space with a laid-out blueprint of your ""office"", which allows you to see who's clocked in and who hasn't yet. Employees can change their status according to their availability, instant message each other using the integrated Slack app and also effortlessly conduct spontaneous meetings just by ""showing up"" in one virtual room and then simply enabling their microphones. You can even receive notifications when someone enters or exits your office.

Video Conferencing Software: Cisco Webex Meetings

We've discussed having a virtual office where you and your team can be in the same place at the same time, but what about hosting video conferences with those from outside your workforce? When you're trying got maintain the trust of vendors and clients, the last thing you need is lag and connectivity issues during your video call.

You can professionally send invites to meetings, chat with other team members within the software itself, share documents or applications during meetings and even integrate it with other apps like Trello or Google Drive for a more productive and seamless workflow.



Time Tracking Software: TSheets and BigTime

TSheets and BigTime allow you to see exactly how much time each employee is spending on a particular task or project, create invoice templates, track your budget, share work schedules and even allows you to assign tasks to employees with just a few clicks. The apps also provide progress reports that show you which tasks your employees are spending most of their time on, discrepancies in workflow and what needs to be done to fix that.

Content Collaboration: Google Drive and Dropbox

Keep your files in one, safe place and accessible anytime. Dropbox and Google Drive are two classic content collaboration software that never fails to deliver.

You can both share files internally and externally using these two software and grant access to specific users to certain files on the cloud. You can also access these files from any device you want. These two applications allow your staff to share, create, synchronize, upload and download files in real-time while also sharing work with people outside of your organization."

"Hi everyone, maybe not a new reason, but, due to COVID19 I'm looking some side job from home. Not necessarily full-time, even better half-time, or per contract.

The only thing I can't do in Excel is VBA. Other than that: charts, graphs, reports - you name it, everything. All served on a plate with custom formatting (yeah, kinda hate defaults ).

Used to create content for healthy food website, so content creation, research, data entry, the whole enchilada - can be done.

I can also work quite decently in Photoshop. I wouldn't named myself a guru, but hell, I can retouch a picture,  create coloring book, and I definitively know why is the difference between raster vs. vector, and 72dpi vs. 300dpi.

So, if you have something for me (not fishy, spammy, I smell those from afar) please write.

Thanks."

"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I started my first 100% remote job a year ago next month. It's a great place to work but there's a huge problem on my team at the moment with employee development. We're cycling through so many managers and team members, it's always a round-robin of training and catch up.

&#x200B;

I'm still looking to move up in my company, but also applying elsewhere. I have a pretty solid resume in terms of content and a respectable, although not entirely specialized work history. I am currently a Senior Analyst in IT and that basically means I do everything from project management, project delivery, on-boarding, training and QA, scrum, and more. I have light skills in all of those areas but apparently it's not enough or I'm approaching all of the remote companies wrong :(

&#x200B;

Anywho...hoping someone has advice. I think my biggest problem is these days you need a reference to get into any company. that's how I got into the company I'm with now."
"Lets say I am a person who speaks english fluently (no proof), but no US citizenship and no experience . I live in US time zone, so i should logically apply for US or Canadian firma. But how that happens even? What will they ask for? Just my passport? How will they check my english knowledge? I got my note from private school and final exam note. Will they care if I am from Ukraine, for example?"
"UPDATE!! It was a miss on the recruiters end lol 


I'm supposed to start a new role tomorrow haven't gotten any Comms about when I'm needed to go in. I'm fully remote all I'm doing is meeting my mentor as well as getting my tech gear and meeting any team member that's in the same state im in. I signed all the papers and everything so not sure what's happening lol I was told I'd get confirmation by the weekend on when I have to go in and I sent the recruiter emails today and they are not sure why my team is not responding back. They are pretty relaxed so I'm either supposed to be going in later in the day or be there early morning. The commute to the HQ is an hour and half from where I am 

I was going to go in the morning and just find someone in the HQ...not sure if this is good start? Should I be looking for a new remote role in case? "
"So I just got out of an 8 month stint doing remote data work for a US company. I'd found this job posting on r/workonline and its the best paying work from home job I've done. Fulltime, weekends off,  $11/hr and weekly payments. They even provided health stipend and paid and sick leaves. That's over 2k$ every month. The work was mind numbing but for someone from a third world country used to getting paid once a month after slogging it out, this job was a luxury! So please accept my thanks the r/workonline community. 

As you can imagine, it's been hard to find a similar job. I've tried transcription which is shitty pay for the work, and even APPEN/LB but haven't heard anything despite passing their qualifications. 

Is there any way I could land a remote CS job without experience in customer service and being non US? What companies are hiring? I'm pretty good in written and spoken communication because I am basically a copywriter but only do gigs for a couple of clients and haven't been able to do it full time. However I'm more into my personal writing assignments right now. Which is why I'm concentrating on full time CS jobs. Please help :) Thank you.

"
"""Work from home"" sounds like something invented by the RTO crowd to make it sound like we're all just chillin in our jammies on the couch. I can easily understand why some people wouldn't want to work at home all the time and are averse to the concept of ""WFH."" But it's nonsense.   Remote work can still mean working in an office. it doesn't mean ""work from home."" it means ""work wherever the heck you want as long as you can still do your job.""

Realizing that if the task can be done on the computer than it can be done from just about anywhere on the planet is something managers and property investors are desperate for people to not grasp and making ""wfh"" the colloquial term serves that purpose.  I've been working remotely for 15 years. sometimes I rent an office, sometimes i work at the beach.  ""work from home"" is intentionally reductionist and intentionally uninspiring.  i would ditch the phrase entirely."
"I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. The money was decent and I had the potential to grow my salary, but at that point, the money was not worth my mental health (I was almost hospitalized from burnout). I got a new job that is 5 days in the office and took a $10K paycut (which I thought would end up not making a difference, but it really does smh). I bought a car and of course, with the car came expenses for gas every week and a half, required maintenance and the dreaded insurance. At my job, there is also heavy pressure to go to happy hour and drink heavily, as well as spend money to participate in activities for ""the office culture"".

  
I realized immediately I made a huge mistake taking this in-office job. I know that I can start bringing lunches from home, say no to happy hours and activities, etc, but along with taking a paycut, I am losing so much money.

  
I am debating finding a remote job again so that I can save money and hopefully get a higher salary. I also hate going into the office. Is this a good idea? I would still have the car and its expenses, but I could potentially sell it. 

  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "
"Hi everyone!

Right now I'm 100% remote and I make 115k in a HCOL area.

I'm working in software development in healthcare. I find the job incredibly boring. I was working in space/satellites before I made the transition to healthcare two years ago.

I've casually been looking for jobs back in space and I've made it through the final rounds interviews in a job that is in a research lab that develops software for satellites. I'm just waiting to hear back to see if I got the job.

Obviously the base salary difference isn't a big difference however this potential new company offers 25% of your salary into your 401k without any contributions on my end. I could potentially retire very early which has always been a dream of mine.

I'm getting cold feet about leaving my job. I love working from home but I don't see myself in this job forever and this opportunity sounds like a great step for my career.

In addition to the 25% to my 401k they offer health care through an IBA that's worth 25% of my salary. Any money I don't use that month on healthcare I receive back. My total compensation would be around 182k.

Just wanted to vent/ here others peoples thoughts.

I hope this was coherent!

Edit: My commute would be less than 25 minutes and my hours could be flexed. "
"I work for a media and advertising company with rather large clients and huge campaigns. Thankfully everyone  can work from home and there is no plan to return to office!   


  
The other week I was visiting my parents for a long weekend and would work from their guest room for one day. They have been retired for a few years but owned their own in-person business when they did work. They had an office and at one point 10  employees. Growing up, sometimes one of them would work from home and since they were the boss they still had some autonomy over their schedule. 

  
When I was taking meetings or in a flow they still would walk in and interrupt the meetings or my flow periodically throughout the day. Some meetings were with the  clients which through me off when interrupted.   
I explained to them numerous times to please not interrupt me while I am working. I tried to communicate that it should be like I am in an office and on a schedule as they did when they had to go into their business.  However, the only viewpoint they have is from their own business. In their mind, if I am home, I should feel like I am at home.   


So does anyone else have family members that does not understand that work from home is still ""at work."""
"I have a work from home job but I hate working from home given my current living conditions. What are alternatives besides ""a coffee shop"" of where I can go to work. It seems like all the we work closed down."
"What did you wish you'd known? I am moving as my wife took a new job, and am too valuable to lose so I am now one of the few in my company that is 100% remote. This makes a lot of sense because I operate basically as management for an internal MSP (IT that works with many offices around the country that are own3d by the same company but operate aonewhat independetly) - I work remotely with every site but the site we sit at. Now I just add one more remote site to my list, so not a huge change, but right now I only work 1 day a week from home. What are some challenges and advice you can tell me about?"
"I have been working from home for 5 months now and while I love all the benefits it brings, I actually hate my role. I work in HR so it's difficult to ever get a remote job in this field and my employer made a very special exception for me. I've looked all over and most of the jobs are hybrid and that will require me to move 2 hours north of where I am currently living.

Anyone ever feels stuck in the job they are in only because it's fully remote and no one else is offering it around them? All the other fully remote jobs I've looked at require a 50% or more paycut and also has thousands of applicants (I would also be taking a step back in my career)."
Your thoughts
"I am interviewing for a position that pays $13,000 less than what I am making now. It is the exact same position but it's 100% work from home. They said that their offer cannot go up at all as it's what is left in the budget. 

(They apparently have 401k match, really good benefits, decent vacation/sick, and end of year bonuses.)

I loathe my current company and that's why I am looking for a new job. I had to stay for a year in order to fulfill my sign on contract and that has ended in the beginning of June. This would be the shortest time I've ever stayed at a company. 

My current company is a 35 minute drive in and a 45 min drive home. I work from home two days a week. 

My car is getting louder every day, I've just replaced the alternator and battery in October/December.  So, I am in the market for a new car because of the travel I have to do for work, otherwise I would hold out until I can't drive it to the grocery store.

I'm a bit stuck here because $13,000 is a really big amount! 

Edit: Current is 118k and new would be 105k. 

What would you do? Do you have any advice?"

Every time there is a CEO giving ultimatum to RTO or quit, just remember if it were up to them, we would be working 7 days are week on a below minimum wage. I am still trying to understand how forcing back in to the office and checking attendance is helping get more productivity out of them.

We should use this logic when supporting the WFH argument. "
"I was hired post-Covid, as mostly WFH, in a senior position in an agency with 50 members of staff. Unlike most of colleagues, I live 200 miles from the office. 

I am one of the only remote employees left (the other three have either been fired or quit).

All staff have to go into the office four times a week and my boss asked me to go into the office three times a month (because of how far I live). I drive in and yes, it's a long commute. But it's a good job for me, in the sense that I enjoy the work. 

This arrangement has been going on for over a year and a half. The commute isn't the main problem here. 

The problem is that, as more people get hired into the office, my strange set-up becomes more and more... unusual. I feel like I have to keep justifying it to everyone, even though I work really long hours, I am really focused, and I do great work remotely. 

HR are openly anti-WFH, turning away any candidates who mention WFH or hybrid. They honestly despise remote workers, assuming them all to be lazy (probably because they can't WFH themselves tbh, and they assume no one can; either that or they're jealous. Or both.)

I've just gotten to the point of being sick and tired of people assuming I don't do as much as they do because I WFH, of people feeling jealous, of people being petty and purposely not including me in meetings (because doing it online 'isn't the same', etc.), of needing to always explain what I'm doing - to people who aren't my boss and assume I sit around all day, or feel like I owe them an explanation.

The irony of it all is that, while in the office, people waste so much time being unproductive!

My question is, what do I do?

Should I search for another job, one where I can WFH alongside a team who respect this and also work remotely? With a team who aren't catty and jealous and hostile to my setup? 

Part of me feels like I shouldn't care and if I do the job well, like the job, and my boss is happy that's all that matters. He hired me after all, and he and I get along well. But I also crave an environment where I don't have to constantly justify myself or 'perform' my productivity to others. Or feel like I'm going to be fired because they're so anti-WFH. 

This all said, perhaps I am in a grass is greener mindset. After all, all jobs have nasty people, jealous people, malicious people and ultimately it's up to oneself to decide what to care about.

What do you think I should do?"
"Advice needed.  I currently work a 100% remote role for a company that happens to have its HQ office about 45 minutes away from my home.  There are a handful of employees in this same boat.  I have been with the company 2 years, am a high performer, and am well-liked.  There is no requirement for ""locals"" to come work out of HQ, though many do drop in one a week or so.  I do not (with rare exceptions, like a holiday party or a baby shower) because I am infinitely more productive at home.  No one cares that I don't drop in.  My supervisor does care.  My department manager doesn't care.  Whee!

The trouble is, my partner does not WFH and was recently laid off.  He is job hunting and has reached the final round of interviews for a new position.  It feels like an inevitability that he will get this job.  The catch: we would have to move out of state if he takes this job.

I would like to keep my current job.

My company is, again, 100% remote and has employees located all over the country.  On top of that, there are already employees at my company working in the state where we would be headed.  I was hired as a remote worker with no expectation of being in the office despite being a ""local"" to HQ - they do encourage locals to come in but it is not mandatory and like I said before, no one has ever given me any grief for not coming in.

But if my partner gets this job and we start the wheels of moving, I'll have to let my company know that I will be relocating somewhere not-local.  Half of my team is located out of state so in theory I feel like this is not a problem.  In practice, I'm afraid that I will lose my job because there seems to be rumblings all over the place in this job market that companies want a RTO.  This would be impossible with my company given that we are all scattered around the country, but I'm afraid that my choosing to no longer be ""local"" will be frowned upon.

If my partner gets this job, what would be the best way to approach this conversation with my manager? The core message I want to deliver is ""I love working here and I would like to keep my job when we move, please let me do that because it wouldn't change anything about the way I work because I never come to HQ anyway."" (But more eloquent and professional than that.)

Conversely, a friend of mine who is a former employee of my company (was pushed out of her job due to shitty politics which is another story for another day) told me to keep my mouth shut, quietly move, maintain residency in my current state (which wouldn't be hard as we are not planning to sell our house, we are going to allow my cousin to move in with her family and I would be visiting a lot to see them and my friends here and would be working here occasionally). and see how things shake out.  This advice seems highly problematic.  However, she used to run payroll at my company for our hundreds of remote workers nationwide, so her advice isn't exactly uninformed.  On the other hand, she was pushed out of her job by a manager who had an agenda and it was really upsetting and she's understandably angry at the company and I know that is coloring her advice.

Another colleague who is a friend and works on my team currently in my same job function has also advised me to keep quiet if my partner gets the job.  She is not local to HQ.

I really feel like it's not smart to not say anything if we are moving but I honestly don't know if this is a problem if I am still technically maintaining a residence in my current home state.

What do I do?

And before anyone asks - I will always be the trailing spouse in my relationship because my partner out-earns me by 3x and that is not likely to ever change due to his experience and his industry.  I also, while I love my job, consider it to be a ""day job""/""health insurance job"" because I am a working musician and consider that to be my real career.  I just happen to have lucked into a day job that I genuinely enjoy and I don't want to lose that.  I don't have a ""career track"" in my day job's industry the way he does.

Any advice would be appreciated, especially if you are a manager who has been in this position with a remote-classified direct report who moved to a different state.

EDIT: Should have mentioned this more clearly, but I think the advice I've been given is terrible advice and in addition to figuring out how to address this situation with my manager I wanted a sanity check that the advice was as terrible as I thought it was."
"While I didn't mind being in the office at first, the crappy company culture combined with....well, having to drive an hour each way to get to said crappy company culture just really turned me off of it. If I'm going to have to deal with gossipy coworkers and folks trying to undermine me, I'd prefer to do it from the comfort of my own home! 

I am taking a smidge of a pay cut, but it's for a much larger company, so I don't mind. Plus, again, it's 100% remote. Excited to start soon! I did remote work a few years back for a startup, so I'm looking forward to bein' back (this time, with a much-upgraded home office lol)."
"Serious question, albeit maybe obvious lol.  I wfh. 100% as my office is out of state.  But when I say home, I mean home.  I don't attempt to work a shift while driving, or at an airport or in between appointments or anything.  If I need a day to do one of those I use pto. 

I have several coworkers who almost never work from a home office or similar.  They are in cafes, in their van, or at the airport or wherever.  Imo, there is a massive difference between these regarding productivity, focus, availability etc.

 Are cafe shift folks ruining it for those that actually have an office to use at home?  The folks I see doing it are distracted, flustered, on and off Slack and generally less productive and/or available."
"When I started my job from the office, it's always been 37.5 hrs/week considered full-time salary. I went on ADA for several months, then COVID hit and everyone was WFH. Recently, they've been demanding folks go back into the office for -at minimum- hybrid; however, they've left those of us who were ADA alone. 

Last week, I finally received approval for permanent WFH; shortly thereafter, I received a separate email indicating my hours were now 40/week. 

I don't understand the difference and it's not explained in employee handbook. Thoughts? For reference, I'm in PA.

Edit: I'm unsure why there were so many downvotes when I gave truthful statements; this post wasn't seeking advice, but rather the logic of the difference. I've seen (via searches) a couple others ask the same question from time to time, but have never seen a solid answer. 

I neglected to mention I'm also 70% disabled veteran status, but those conditions weren't factored into the ADA accommodation, so I didn't think it was relevant. I also did speak with my boss (he's the one who mentioned even he didn't know why the hours changed). 

Solved! Anyway, for those interested, big thanks to u/vtinesalone for the suggestion to go back to the employee handbook. I was basing my original hours off my offer letter and also looking in an incorrect place in the handbook.

The employee handbook has been updated to include employee classifications that reflect hours based on location (such as home office +2 other locations) 37.5 and 40 (other locations) as Regular Full-Time,"" and they've added remote workers into their own category as 'all other locations and remote' as ""regular part time,"" so it looks like there's the logic I was looking for. 

Thanks to everyone who made some genuine attempts to help figure out the variance!!

Edit 2: Upon further review, both the FT and PT are listed based on location and hours (up to 40); I will review what I'm listed in workday to confirm and go from there. "
"I posted here earlier about regretting leaving my remote job. Not because it's hybrid, mainly because the job wasn't what I expected, I hate it, and my boss lied about flexibility.  

I am salaried exempt. My old job is the only remote job I had. They didn't care about tracking or hitting x hours as long as I was available during core hours and got my work done. This was perfect for my schedule since I typically drop off and pick up my baby when husband can't. 

Prior to accepting new job I was told the core hours and typical work week schedule.  New boss said I could start at 9. What I didn't know was that it meant making up those hours to hit x amount of hours each day whether it means working later evening, skipping lunch (which by policy is 45 min). If you run late from a doctor appt. you need to make it up later.. she seriously expected me to stay at the office until 6pm (when everyone usually heads home earlier) just  to hit my hours, but I negotiated to skip lunch. Everyone also announces when their lunch is running over, if they have a doctor appointment and when they will make up their time. They will send a group message, ' have a doctors appointment! Running a bit late but I will be making it up this weekend!' to the team. 

I feel uncomfortable announcing that. Old jobs, I just told communicate to my boss and blocked my calendar.

I hate reporting and feeling restricted and it's interfering with my life cuz then I only see my daughter 1.5 hours before bed time....

I am seriously considering asking for my old job back if flexibility is actually a rare thing. I would hate to apply to other jobs again only to waste my time. This time I am only applying for remote."
"Here's the deal:

- Traffic's a Nightmare, Right? More folks working from home means fewer cars jamming up the roads. Less traffic equals fewer accidents and a smoother ride for everyone.
- Hunting for Parking Sucks: With less people driving to work, finding a parking spot won't feel like the Hunger Games.
- Delays Be Gone: buses on time more often thanks to less traffic 
- Breath of Fresh Air: With fewer cars on the road, we're not just cutting down on noise pollution but also slashing the amount of noxious gases choking up our air. This means a significant bump in air quality, making those deep, city breaths a lot less toxic.
- Healthier, Happier Cities: Embracing remote work could mean not just cleaner air but also fewer sick days for all. With less crowding on public transport and in offices, we're giving contagious diseases fewer chances to spread.
- Local Love, Global Work: By rooting for remote work, we're supporting an economy where spending isn't confined to city centers. It's a shift that promises to rejuvenate neighborhood businesses, as remote workers distribute their dollars closer to home, breathing new life into local markets.

Bottom Line:

If you can't work from home, you should still be all for remote work. Less hassle getting to work, and quicker rides. Plus, driving without playing dodge-the-idiot? Priceless. Remote work's making everyone's day a bit easier, even if your office is still your second home."
"I recently started a position with a reputable, well known and trusted healthcare company that is hybrid 4 days a week WFH and 1 day a week in-office (conveniently located about 20 minutes away from my home). I was so relieved and excited to have gotten the job since it is a competitive position that I worked very hard for, and was looking forward to the change of pace as I've been going through the stress of IVF and recently discovered I am pregnant. I wanted to be in the comfort of my home in case I needed to frequently use the bathroom, give myself the IVF meds or suddenly feel the urge to puke. The job itself is also a perfect fit and my colleagues seem to be really great.
However, what I didn't factor in was that they are expecting me to train in-office, and there's a catch: I won't just be training at the office near my home where I'll be working, the other people in my position who are training me are located all around, in offices up to an hour away from my home. The traffic during rush hour coming home has been also been awful, yesterday an hour and a half, and has impacted my IVF medication schedule and causing tons of stress.
I am a very professional and reasonable person, and initially understood and did not at all mind coming in person to shadow and learn the new documentation system and work flow. But the other issue is that no one knows how long this will be going on for, since I still do not have access to the remote EMR after three weeks (I did the training already and access was requested by the manager) and they are essentially just having me shuttle around so I can be paid to do something. As of right now, I feel like I can start my job at home without issue if only I could get the remote access. I feel like I'm back in the rat race every morning and come home completely drained. Don't know if I can do this another few weeks.
Did any of you experience this type of training prior to doing remote work? Would it be reasonable to ask when I should expect to go remote or does that come across as snarky? TIA"
"I've been remote now for just over two years. First job was working for government contracts. I didn't love the job, and I was micromanaged but overall.. still blew the hell out of doing the same job from a cubicle. 

Now I work in insurance sales, and while my income isn't nearly as good as I'd like it.. I've done a lot worse. But working from home is just truly amazing. 

I have virtually no stress for work. I have a very hands off boss and I'm very competent at what I do for only being a 1-year employee.

My job starts at 9. I usually wake up around 6, naturally. (Wife is a teacher so her alarm gets me up even if I don't wake up first). I have 3 hours to do whatever I want. Lately it's been studying for school. 

It's so nice knowing there's no ""getting ready"". No commute to prep for. No mental gymnastics of timing things out to make sure I'm not late. All my time just saying my own. 

Oh shit it's 8:59am and I'm downstairs? Walk upstairs, sign in, done. Complete control of the room. AC set at a temp that best works for me. Shirtless. Comfortable gaming chair. Feet up on the desk. Snacks at the ready. Everything I need to be as comfortable as needed. It does SO much for my motivation to succeed and do well, and it shows in my results. 

I've never had a problem working in person, but now that I've worked from home I'll have a very hard time not doing it."
"These companies are still out there but my god the job market is really bad and honestly I just got lucky. Hundreds upon hundreds of applicants all fighting over the same positions. If not even thousands for remote jobs.

Any way, y'all got any tips and tricks for me to make my life / job easier from you vets?"

" In my job search for remote work opportunities, I've noticed many listings mentioning required travel despite being labeled as remote roles. As a professional with relevant experience interested in fully location-independent work, I want to understand this trend better.

Is ""remote"" evolving to include regular travel between offices? Or do these roles not fully match my goal of finding a work-from-home position without a travel requirement? I'm open to learning more about the expectations and logistics. My priority is finding the right long-term fit where I can contribute my skills without routine travel disrupting my home life. Help me understand if these positions align with a true work-from-home arrangement? I'm optimistic but it defeats the entire point of a remote job if I still have to commute. "
"Has anyone moved from a fully remote to hybrid setup? My current job is fully remote with no chance of RTO (small startup) but I have a job offer for a hybrid position 3 days a week in-office with a \~45 min commute one way with expectation to attend some trade shows (4-5 a year). I lucked out with my remote role as a jr. The work isn't too bad but I feel very stagnant in my current role along with never really being offline since it's a startup. The job offer would be slight leg up with a 5k pay bump in a large company and industry I've been hoping to break into but the 3-days in office is really putting me in a bind. I don't have a car and live in a very HCOL area with no parking available even if I did get a car. One of my relatives works near the office so I'd be able to hitch a ride to the office but the way back home would have to be through public transport since said relative gets off earlier than me.

I've grown to appreciate the remote, flexible work structure and unlimted PTO at my current company and I also have an elderly dog that I want to stay with for as long as possible but I'm also wondering if I'm dooming myself career-wise by not taking a larger company role. I'm aware this is a question I'd probably have to figure out myself but has anyone had to do something similar? What would it take for you to move from a remote to hybrid job?"
"I'm currently extremely unhappy with my employer. I work for a university and my role is generally remote throughout different departments. I was hired as a remote employee as I live three hours away from the office. 

My manager has been micromanaging me to the extreme, she has to be CC'd on all emails and wants me to send an update every single day for tasks. She keeps calling me to the office in the middle of the week randomly for ""training"" purposes. It takes me 6 hours to do  commute for a 2 hour training session that can be done remotely. The training session consists of her making me sit on her computer and do menial tasks with her watching over me. 

I'm constantly under stress of commuting 6 hours to the office every week as she calls me whenever she desires and according to her schedule since she lives 15 mins away. I don't make a lot of money and a majority of it goes towards rent and commute. 

I've brought it up multiple times that the commute is causing me financial hardship and an entire day is wasted and I have to work additional hours in the week to catch up. She doesn't seem to understand my hardships and is very critical of everything I do. 

I'm dealing with so much stress. My last paycheck was not received and my manager decided to call me on Friday today and I finally refused. I've complied to all her in office requests but due to not receiving my paycheck , I just cannot afford to commute and plus I already have plans on babysitting my niece. 

I'm stressing out so much that she will say something when she doesn't see me in the office as even though I said I will not be able to come, she still insisted and I got way too annoyed and didn't even reply. There have been instances where she has called me in but hasn't come in herself as she messed up the calendar and I'm just making my three hour commute back. 

I feel she is not a good manager and I'm not being heard. I'm at the verge of quitting as this is causing me too much stress and I don't like the work. 

I'm just too stressed today as this is the first time I stood up for myself by defying her orders."
"This is pretty cool, I wonder what other types of jobs which always seemed to require in person can also be done remotely"
"Starting a new job and the offer looks pretty good, but I'm naturally nervous of being scammed. An HR person from the company saw my portfolio and messaged me off Indeed and did a ""text based"" interview which was odd to me but allowed me a little more time for the answers. They offered me the job this morning and want an answer by EOD. 

They will be sending me a work laptop and want me to buy specific supplies through an ""approved vendor,"" not sure what this means.

I looked up the HR person on Indeed and found their profile and everything matches. This is a big company who is recognize able too.

How are sensitive documents like tax documents normally exchanged?"
"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/us-workers-are-getting-remote-jobs-with-international-companies.html

It's getting harder to find a remote job in the U.S., but you might have better luck working from home for a company based abroad.

The number of American workers hired by international companies grew 62% last year, according to the State of Global Hiring Report from Deel, an HR platform that specializes in global hiring.

The report is based on 300,000 contracts between Deel customers and workers for both contractors and full-time employees, and roughly 85% of those contracts are for remote positions.

American workers are most likely to be hired by companies in the U.K., Canada, France, Singapore and Australia.

The spike in U.S. workers vying for remote jobs headquartered overseas ""feels correlated with the elimination of remote roles"" stateside, says Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz. He knows from experience people are quitting jobs with return-to-office requirements to be remote: ""A couple of our competitors did that, and we hired their best people. So I welcome them to keep doing it.""

Workers with unique, in-demand skills being hired internationally

Global employers want to tap into the U.S. talent market because it's so large and has produced some of the most influential companies in the world, Bouaziz says. International bosses want to ""leverage more U.S. talent to bring some of that culture that leads to the biggest enterprises in the world to their home country.""

Americans who work remotely for international employers tend to live in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Austin and Miami. These U.S. economic powerhouses are ""a playground"" to hire highly knowledgeable workers with ""unique skills"" in product, growth and sales, Bouaziz says. Some of the most common jobs are in research, sales, software engineering, content and product.

""A lot of those companies are thinking, 'How do we build the right playbook that they've done in the U.S.?"" Bouaziz adds. ""One way is to bring U.S. workers to their companies.""

By age, roughly half of American workers with contracts via Deel are between 25 and 34 years old; 18% are between 35 and 44, while 25% are 45 years or older.

The upsides and downsides

Working remotely for an internationally company isn't as straightforward as simply working from home.

Aside from figuring out taxes and other HR compliance issues, Bouaziz says it's important to consider differences in time zones. A Californian working for a company based in Europe may have to adjust to early hours.

A lot also rides on how the company's distributed workforce is set up: Are you the only American employed by a company abroad, or are you part of a larger group stateside? Do you work from home, or will you go into a satellite office? Does your whole team work the same hours, or do you overlap for part of the day and rely on asynchronous work for the other?

Then, cultural differences come into play from the small things (like holiday time off) to the big (communication norms). ""Jumping cultures can be quite intense,"" Bouaziz says. ""It's something you need to be malleable for. It's not hard, but you do need to understand"" and accept norms "" to make everyone comfortable and do their best work while being considerate.""

That being said, accepting the norms of a different country's work culture can also be a big plus. You may enjoy a different style of communication or perspective on work-life balance. Or you might thrive integrating into an organization with more diversity, Bouaziz says, especially if you get to work with colleagues across multiple countries. Those benefits can extend beyond the workplace, he adds: ""Different perspectives help you have a different lens on the world.""

Being able to bring a company to a new U.S. market can be an interesting challenge, he adds, and you may get to be among the first to bring U.S. culture to an international organization.

If you're interested in landing a remote job for a company based abroad, start by using job boards like LinkedIn and filtering for remote jobs based ""worldwide."" Another resource is Otta, which lists jobs at international startups and trending companies that are more likely to have remote flexibility. (For what it's worth, Deel is hiring for 190 open roles around the world, a spokesperson adds.)

Ultimately, ""don't overthink it too much,"" Bouaziz says. ""You'll find that people, wherever you go, tend to be nice."""
I've been applying to a lot of different companies for various roles. My application and resume isn't a contender. I have bartending management and serving experience listed as my most recent job titles. What can I do to get an interview? What jobs should I be applying for based on my customer service background?
"The struggle is finally over. My two week notice at my current job ends tomorrow and I'm starting a new fully remote job. I graduated 8 months ago and landed a job that I commuted 1hr 45 mins each way for. I had no life. Now with a fully WFH, I'm hoping my health and fitness will be back on track. 
Please share any tips you have for working from home? Not sure what to expect but excited!"
"Hi Reddit,

I've come here after being laid off today. I'm trying to brush up on my resume to get a fully remote or Hybrid IT job. I've worked IT for about 10 years now doing stuff like IT in an Amazon FC, Apple Retail Support, and just recently Help Desk Level 2 in a warehouse 3 PL company being the go to for 9 buildings. Any help on how to find my first remote job or any advice about working fully remote IT? This last job near the end I was mainly hybrid so I know how to work from home and manage my schedule. Just lost... I've applied at job listings on ZipRecruiter and Indeed and landed interviews for a few hybrid or in office roles, but looking to really push Remote. I have my CompTIA A+ and will be taking my Net+ end of next month. 

Thank you all!"
"I know it sounds like a no brainer but hear me out.

**Hybrid job:** 175k TC with a large multinational corporation. Company has huge brand recognition and would be good to have on my resume. Requires 2-3 days a week on site, the office is about 35 minutes without traffic and about an hour with traffic one way. Sounds horrible but my last job was fully remote and I honestly missed leaving the house and interacting with people. I was laid off from my last job too so the idea of working for a stable MNC sounds kinda nice. The team at this company also seems very enjoyable to work with and despite the traffic, I expect decent work-life-balance. This job is also in a part of town where I have a lot of friends who I don't get to see as much so this will give me more opportunities to do so after work.

**Remote job:** 200k TC with a fifty person start up. The company itself seems like a shit show based on all my interactions with them during the recruiting process. This job will also require lots of early mornings and late nights because I would be working closely with many offshore teams. Its a slightly more senior position than the hybrid job, but it will likely be way more stressful because its a startup and they seem to lack a lot of business processes.

*tl;dr:* A higher paying more stressful job that is fully remote or a more chill, more secure job that pays less but requires a commute"
"I've been working in banking for the past five years under the impression that moving up in my career would potentially grant me the opportunity to work from home. I've always known banking professionals to work from home and have flexibility. I have always wanted this for myself as my work life balance is important to me. So when everyone got sent home to WFH in 2020 I was so excited! I absolutely loved it and felt more like myself than I ever have. I got to work this way for over two years.

Last year my company announced mandatory RTO two days per week and last week they announced they would be increasing the requirement to three days a week. I am now wondering if eventually I will be working in an office five days a week again. One of the reasons cited in the announcement is that other banks are also requiring three days in office so to remain competitive we will be doing the same.

If banking and finance are moving away from WFH, I don't want to go down this career path anymore. I will do anything to get to work from home again, including a career change. I will go back to school, get certifications, whatever, but I want a career the aligns with the work life balance that I want.

So for those of you who WFH, what field do you work in? What career path should I consider if I value flexibility and remote work? Where do I even look for WFH jobs that aren't a scam?"
I've recently started a new job and for now I'm in the office everyday for training as it's much easier however once training is done we'll be WFH 2/3 days a week. Today I was told the company doesn't give out laptops to employees but the employees remote access the work desktops - (I can't see this being a budgeting issue as it's a global company making billions - and so was curious how this will work? Will I have to use my personal laptop/desktop to work from and if so will they be able to see my files and personal data on these?
"I've been working remotely for 5+ years, and never liked the area I was in. Lots of family here, but not much to do for us.

I am thinking of moving to a small town area, and it's only a few hours away from a big, big city. 

My husband and I just like the smalll town feel. We like the area when we lived there, and worst case we move to the big city if things don't go well for whatever reason. But yeah, we want to be able to do a lot of things there without having to fly from state to state and it's just a nice place. We're still young, so maybe that's why our families think we're crazy, but in our mindset we have the security money worst case and close to a big city for jobs worst case too. Fam and I are just different, we love them of course!

Any similar stories?"
"I'm starting a new position next month that will be remote full-time. I'm looking for suggestions regarding supplies to buy or ways to organize my space to make it as functional as possible. Unfortunately, due to the space in my apartment I don't have space for a desk. I'll be doing most of my work from my dining table."
"I work for a hospital now as an analyst and the implementation of remote work here is inconsistent amongst those who are able to. I'm currently 2 days a week hybrid and even that was an act of god for that to happen. I'm looking for positions elsewhere and from the hospitals I've searched so far in varied places across U.S., there have only been a sparse amount of IT positions that seem to be on board with full remote work (just a few ive seen hybrid). Is anyone else able to confirm what I'm seeing that healthcare IT isn't remote friendly as a whole (or maybe I just need to keep increasing my sample size?)."

https://archive.ph/xfIda

Laying off employees is complicated. New data suggests that managers tend to have an easier time showing remote workers the door.  

Workers logging on from home five days a week were 35% more likely to be laid off in 2023 than their peers who put in office time, according to an analysis of two million white-collar workers conducted by employment data provider Live Data Technologies. The analysis showed 10% of fully remote workers were laid off last year, compared with 7% of those working in an office full time or on a hybrid basis.

""When a hiring manager gets news they have to cut 10% of the staff, it's easier to put someone on the list you don't have a close personal relationship with,"" says Andy Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm. Much of the disparity, he says, is that it's simply harder to build attachments to people you don't see face to face.
Some companies have been more intentional about putting remote workers on the chopping block. Wayfair
, the online home-goods retailer, recently told employees that remote workers would be more likely to be affected in company layoffs. Executives also told staff they believe most workers should be in an office most days.

""We went overboard in hiring during a strong economic period and veered away from our core principles,"" Chief Executive Niraj Shah wrote in an earlier staff memo. Wayfair said while the company believes its best work is done in person, it will continue to have remote roles when warranted.

Out of sight, out of mind

Given that many layoffs over the past year have been concentrated in tech--a remote-friendly industry that overhired during the pandemic--it's not surprising that people working exclusively from home have been harder hit, says George Penn, a managing vice president at Gartner
, an advisory firm, who consults with companies on workforce restructuring. 
Other managerial perceptions could be at play, too, he adds. A Gartner survey in 2021 found that 68% of executives and managers believed in-office workers were higher performers than remote employees. 

In Albuquerque, N.M., Liana Robertson, 56 years old, who was laid off this month from her client support job, says she struggled in her fully remote role to get on the same page as her manager.
""Bosses don't think you're actually doing work, because they can't see what you're doing,"" she says. ""They assume everything takes 10 minutes, and why haven't you finished it?"" 
Ron Porter, a Korn Ferry
consultant on workforce issues, says he is hearing from clients that fully remote workers are getting cut more frequently than their in-office and hybrid colleagues. Part of it, he says, is natural human reluctance managers feel to cut those they have to face in person. It's also possible that workers who are remote 100% of the time may be more marginal to start with, he adds, with managers preferring to keep their strongest employees doing the most important tasks close to them at the office when possible.

Easy come, easy go

Alyssa Ciesky, 40, a talent acquisition specialist based in San Antonio, says that as a fully remote worker, she's aware of the risks. ""They're easy to get rid of, you can't put a face to the name, there's no personal connection."" she says of workers like herself. When Ciesky was laid off at the end of 2022 from her fully remote role at a semiconductor company, she says, her manager was based in England. She said she wasn't surprised.
Still, she says that as a mother of two young children, she's willing to take on the prospect of instability for the flexibility of remote work.
""It's worth it,"" she says, adding that she also likes the feeling of autonomy and the ability to focus that working from home offers. 
David Risch, a recruiter in the supply-chain industry, says that especially in today's weaker job market, he cautions candidates to keep their eyes open with all-remote roles.

""We warn them, easy come, easy go,"" he says. ""A company's going to invest in someone who's investing in them."" 

Remote workers are also more likely to quit. According to Live Data Technologies, 12% of fully remote workers left their company and began a new job within two months in 2023, compared with 9% of those who worked on a hybrid or in-person basis. 

Some CEOs say that while they personally don't look at an employee's remote-work status when determining job cuts, they understood why work-from-home status could put them at higher risk. Other data and studies indicate that executives are rewarding in-office employees with promotions and favorable assignments. 
""If you have a person working in finance who's not coming to the office, why wouldn't you hire that same person in India or in the Philippines?"" said Christian Ulbrich, chief executive of real-estate company Jones Lang LaSalle
, noting that in many cases overseas workers can do the same job for less money. 

""If you don't see anybody, somebody at all, you literally may forget how valuable that person is.""

"Hi All,  I recently applied for a role that's traditionally in-office, but after my initial interview, the general manager expressed interest in exploring the option of me working remotely due to my experience. I'm excited about the prospect, but I could use some advice and insights from those who have successfully convinced their workplace to allow remote work.  
The general manager has requested a meeting this week to discuss how the remote work setup would function and has asked me to prepare an outline detailing my thoughts on this transition, including measures of accountability and inclusion.  
If you've been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear about your experience. How did you approach the conversation with your employer? What points did you highlight to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of remote work? And how did you address concerns about accountability and team inclusion?  
Any tips, advice, or personal anecdotes would be greatly appreciated as I prepare for this meeting. Thanks in advance for your help!"
"I hope this isn't against the rules but I really need advice on this and I feel like this is the place to get it. 

I currently work fully remote. My current company was acquired by the same place that acquired my old company and laid me off so I decided it was time to look for a new job, also in the industry I used to work in which is different from where I am now. I've been looking for two months aggressively and had no luck. Hundreds of applications, a few phone screens, and probably 6 interviews two making it to third rounds and getting ghosted or rejected and they just repost the job and don't hire anyone. Apparently others are saying this is a terrible job market right now. I can't even get a hybrid job and before the schedules would be 4 days at home one in office but now that's rare to find apparently and they all want 3+ days in office.

My current job is making me extremely depressed but it's fully remote which helps my depression a little. Going to an office always made/makes me anxious, depressed, and exacerbates my fatigue so when remote work became popular it was a huge relief for my mental health, to the point I have been adamant about never going to an office job again unless I have no choice. I've gotten so desperate to the point I've considered applying to an in person one which I feel like I could get and just continue looking for remote jobs but then I'm worried that would hinder my ability to get one because now I look like a job hopper and they'd ask why am I looking to leave somewhere after only being there three months. And/or being forced to stay 1-2 years because I can't find another job. It feels like a lose lose but the longer I stay here the less experience I have in the field I want to be in and I'm honestly convinced they're going to lay us off any day now. 

Has anyone had to do this and successfully left the onsite job after a short period of time? How did you explain it? Being unemployed isn't an option so to me right now the alternative to quitting is taking an office job and keep looking because apparently the market is so bad that even hybrid jobs are competitive. If my current job was in the industry I'm looking to be in I'd probably just stay but it's not.

Update 2/1/23: my boss just moved me on to a new project today that is even worse than what I was doing before. I'm afraid this is the sign I was looking for to suck it up and apply to something else even if it has to be onsite. "
"hi everyone,

i started a new job about 6 months ago which has been a 100% wfh position. the company and all the other workers are interstate which makes it difficult to connect with people. 

ive decided to take some annual leave and travel internationally. the plan is to stay overseas and secretly work from home overseas (hopefully they wont find out).

im guessing this wont matter as i work remotely anyways.

has anyone been able to work from home in another country with success?

love to hear any stories/tips"
"I have worked at a restaurant for the last twelve years and recently got a remote office job with an insurance company.  I'm really excited to have a normal schedule and reliable pay but I'm really nervous about how I'll adjust from walking around a restaurant and interacting with people all day to sitting alone and working for 8 hours straight.  

For some context, I live with my parents: my father who also works remote and whose office is down the hall from my bedroom and my mom who doesn't work but does ministry over Zoom along with regular housekeeping duties.  So, I'm not totally alone, but still somewhat isolated.

Any suggestions for adjusting would be greatly appreciated!"
"I am in a bit of a bind. I just graduated recently and am having a lot of difficulty finding a remote job. I graduated with a BS in June and the only relevant work experience I have is working at a Best Buy but the pay is terrible and doesn't sustain my lifestyle. I really want to travel to Japan and Europe and work from there. For my resume, I tried looking for internships while in school but didn't find anything relevant that was actually a remote job opportunity. I had one offer obtained in December but the division didn't have any work for remotes so I declined thinking I could get one elsewhere. Believe me I tried so hard to negotiate as much as I could to work remotes but I was told by the recruiter no and they set a deadline for me to accept.  

I have been using LinkedIn and Indeed and been using this religiously. I got my resume looked over and trying to write cover letters. I applied to like 100 places that have any keyword that says 'remotes' but haven't gotten a single response. I am getting desperate. I really want a remote opportunity because ever since I was a kid I dreamed of having my own office just like my dad because he had remotes for everything. I loved everything about it and especially the way they work shooting out lasers wirelessly. My favorite remote was always the remote we had for our stereo system because it had these funky buttons and I would pretend it was a cellphone. I am so passionate about remotes since then and I want to get into designing and fixing them. I also love the remote for my 43"" TV because I love putting on Netflix through the little red shortcut button on it. Also love my garage door opener remote. Feels like I am in charge of the opportunity to open and close a huge door to my future. But no place out there is giving me an opportunity to work on any type of remote. Is it because its outdated tech since everything is switched to app-based now? 

How do I land this type of remote job opportunity that pays well?"

###### ""New data shows employees in the UK spend more time working remotely than their counterparts elsewhere.""

"" 

**Satellite view.** One-third of US-based workers are still remote, according to [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/22/remote-work-family-socialization-time-use/), despite an increase in return-to-office (RTO) mandates. But there's a marked difference in who's working remotely: The Post reports that women, who are more likely to also act as caretakers, work from home at higher rates than men.

""I'm finding that companies, as well as their employees, are really getting themselves to strike that right balance and really strike the balance of productivity as well as flexibility,"" Dawn Fay, an operational president at Robert Half, [told Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-job-or-not-return-to-office-hot-labor-market-2023-6#)."""
"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask this in.

A few months ago I started a remote accounting position with a local bank. Coworkers are nice and helpful, pay is okay, and my supervisor is a bit cold but not really a micromanager. (so far...)

The problem is I feel really misled. I went for this position because it was sold as a basic accounting support role. As an introverted person that's the whole reason I even picked this field. In the actual job I quickly found out that I'm actually on the phone a lot. Lots of A/R and collections type of work. I can do it but I really don't like it and feel pretty annoyed that this was never brought up. Not to mention it just causes unnecessary stress in my day. I understand that this is a part of the accounting field but to have it be a MAJORITY of my daily work is different...

I have an interview from a local CPA firm for a similar role but it is in person. During that interview I would make sure to inquire if I'd be doing a majority of collections type of work. That position would be a 10 minute commute and pays slightly less.

I don't know if I should stick it out with the comforts of a remote job but spending 80% of the day doing something I really hate versus having to be in office but not having to spend the day doing something I hate.

Any advice?"
"Posted a couple weeks ago how I recently left my job of 5 years. We worked completely remote for two years then mandated RTO 3 days a week. I was commuting 1.5hrs there and 1.5 hrs back. Sitting in traffic hating my life. I was able to get a job opportunity closer to home making my commute 30 minutes but the catch was I would have to be in the office 5 days. The job also paid slightly better. I decided I would give it a go to get away from the awful commute and I have been at my current job 
 for 3 months. I have learned that I hate the office. I love working remote and can focus so much more and I'm so much happier. My office is an open floor plan and you can hear everyone's conversations. There's office drama I don't care to involve myself in. Something I would not have to deal with at home. I'm going to stay here at my current job till I can find a new fit and will start applying today. Should I include my current job on my resume? Will it look bad if I am applying places and I've only been here 3 months? I can easily explain I'm looking to switch to remote but I wanted some advice. Thank you all!!!!"

"I work in IT/research and my job has been remote with people across the country from the beginning.  We would basically go into an office to work and have remote meetings.  Even our small staff meetings were conducted via Zoom with all of us in our offices!  We officially got sent home 100% of the time in March of 2020 and now our supervisor wants us to come in twice a week and work from home 3 days a week.  Sounds like a good deal except when you realize that there's no reason at all to endure that hellish commute, pay for parking (we do not get stipends) and sit in that stale environment in a high crime neighborhood to do my job.  I've been so happy and content with my job this past year and I've really started to enjoy my work.  My productivity has been through the roof, I'm fine with taking meetings at whatever time of day and I'm here all of the time for my disabled husband who also suffers from depression (which has been markedly improved over the past year or so).  I also got the best review of my life for last year's work.  

I've been with this place on various projects for almost 20 years.  So leaving isn't something I want to take lightly.  I do like and respect my co-workers, even though I am a total introvert.  But I'm in the twilight of my career (the last 10 - 15 years or so of it) and life is too short.  If I were younger, I'd count my blessings but I'm old and I'm tired of just putting up with this.   My husband is older than me and I want to spend more time with him. I don't mind coming in on occasion when there is a physical need for me to be in the office or even for our quarterly, all day planning sessions. But I don't want to have to come in every week for no reason just to make someone else feel more in charge, even for just two days.  I meet with HR next week to discuss this further because I won't just blanket agree to hybrid, which I believe is probably a slippery slope back to 5 days a week because everyone in charge is an extrovert that loves that office life.  Any advice on how to present my case is appreciated!"
"I get pissed off when I read articles about people being forced to go back to the office. Working for a remote-first company for 4 years now I can't imagine ever working in a crowded and loud open-space office again. But the reality is that most companies aren't mature enough for remote work. They switched to it because they were forced to do so, did a poor job executing it and now they want to go back. 

My recommendation to people who want to continue working remotely: find a job at a remote-first company that does remote work well. 

I wrote a blog post on the topic and came up with 5 basic requirements to make remote work work. They're also a good checklist to separate the better remote companies from the rest when looking for a good remote job. Check it out: https://matejlatin.com/blog/2022/06/14/remote-work-is-not-for-everyone/"
"I've been at my current job for 8 years and I accepted a position last week for a fully remote position.  I really like the people in my department, but it has been becoming a meatgrinder and the powers that be fail to see reason, so this all kinda came at the perfect time for me.  I'll be making 25% more money, and it encompasses maybe 10% of the work I'm currently doing in an on-site position (in addition to some pretty solid extras).  We did do remote for a year and a half at my current job, but the powers that be wanted RTO more than anything, even though some of them didn't even know how long we worked remote.

That is what it is though.  I'm currently able to work from home when the need arises (sick, but not in bed all day sick/need to make a doctors appointment/worker coming to the house for repairs/etc) so I'm used to being able to work remote, but I guess I don't know what it's gonna be like to have a fully remote position.

During the pandemic I literally did my job from a Microsoft Surface while sitting on my couch.  After the RTO I ended up moving a desk to a room in my house and we set up my personal machines and work provided some equipment which has made a big difference working remote for me.

My new position is providing the basic setup - laptop, dock, keyboard, mouse, two monitors.

I purchased an electric standing desk, a filing cabinet with storage, and a walking pad.

I think four times or so a year I will have to fly out and go on site, but from my understanding it's generally for interaction and community within the company as well as some various instances where on-site work will need to be completed.

I'm beside myself excited and very pleased with the position.  Every benefit is better and I've wanted to work from home since before 2020.

Is there any general advice or tips anyone feels would be helpful to this transition for me?  My wife works in an office close to home, we are childfree, and have a few cats and a dog.  I get plenty of interaction from friends.  I just want to do well and hit the ground running and I want to avoid bad habits since a lot of movement is now removed from my day (though it just seems like it'll be easier to exercise during the day now).

Literally any advice is appreciated.  Thank you for your time!"
I realize this may be a silly question but I was wondering if anyone knows if there are recruiters who specifically connect with remote jobs? I'm trying to shift to remote work which would involve some amount of career shifting and have been a little unsure of how to try and hone in on what kind of job to look for

"I feel like this has been asked a few different ways, but I can't find the exact scenario I am facing and/or solid advice on how to proceed. 

I have a second/third interview coming up with a large organization in Illinois. I live in Mississippi. The job is advertised as remote, so remote work is not the problem. The problem is this nugget I got from their HR: Company X *not registered to do business in Mississippi. This means that the  Company X paycheck would deduct federal taxes, but not any state/local  taxes;* ***the employee would be responsible for submitting any state/local  taxes to the appropriate  authorities.*** 

So....this is giving me pause. Everything I have read says that companies MUST register with a state and withhold state income tax for employees that reside there. I would be fine if they said they were going to double tax me and I had to file the out-of-state Illinois return to get a refund, but this seems odd to me. You all will probably be SHOCKED to know that the MS Dept of Revenue is less than useful and told me to consult an attorney. I will ask my CPA before accepting any job offer, but was curious if you all had any insight. Would it be as simple as estimating my state income tax throughout the year and just paying come tax time? I am fine with that too, but certainly don't want to fun afoul of any tax laws and/or get in a situation where the employer wants to let me go vs. the headache of registering to do business in another state. I have no idea how arduous that process is and my job is literally one of thousands at the company and not THAT important (no matter what i tell myself!). "
"I am a tech professional with 15+ years of work ex based out of India. There are so many jobs that I am a great fit for, which are published
d as being remote, but only people in US, and some of Europe can apply. I fail to understand the logic behind this. 

""Yeah, we are a 100% remote team and will be forever, but you have to be in one of these countries to work for us"" 

What is even the point? I mean, you are OK with people being in US, UK, Australia and a Singapore, but god forbid if there is someone based out of India!

Edit: so many of you have made good points. I
Didn't articulate well - it was more of ""what should be"" vs ""what is"" kind of post. I get it we can't work around the laws and taxes and stuff. Thanks for all your comments.

Edit 2: Great answers and insights! Thanks everyone. 
PS: Let's not say all (workers from a given country) are (this bad word) or (that bad word). E.g. for India, there will be all sorts of people in a billion!"
"I don't like to use my work computer for personal use. Sometimes out of laziness I will get on Reddit, but that's about it.

Recently, I've been remoting into my personal desktop from my work laptop because I need to run some tools that I can't do so on my work computer without installing stuff that would take too long to get approval for. I'm doing some SQL based tutorials and it's easier to run software on my personal PC. My boss doesn't seem to care so I moved forward and I'm not dealing with any pushback.

I was curious if employers can see what I'm doing on my remote PC though. Let's say I were to go on travel and wanted to do personal things after finishing my work, would it be reasonable for me to log into my personal computer using Google Remote Desktop to do my personal things. I don't like the idea of traveling with 2 laptops. It's annoying."

To the person who suggested applying to WFH jobs that don't have offices in same state as you to reduce chances of getting called to offices nearby...good suggestion BUT most out of state fully remote jobs won't hire unless you are in particular states! Its in all their little disclaimers. how are people getting hired for fully remote jobs when you're not in their ideal time zone or state?"
"As a parent with a child in the school system, it's absurd how little flexibility is given to parents for pickup and drop off times.

"Had a talk with management a few weeks ago and he said to WFH for now and they'd figure it out.  He seemed surprised but generally agreeable to my reasons for staying home.  I haven't heard anything since and it seems like it's just being accepted. I offered to come in once a month or an as needed basis but I pretty much said no thanks to the full time office or scheduled hybrid thing.  It was a risk but I'm glad I took it.   So far, so good.

I've seriously worked from wilderness areas with a cell booster while I should have been on vacation because I don't want one complaint about me not being in the office.

"Hi all, I work for a company that has been remote since the pandemic. Our company encourages us to use our global offices, but is not permitted.
I had scheduled a trip home to see my family weeks ago. I didn't let my boss know since it's same time zone and wouldn't effect my work schedule/hours.

I've received a calendar invite for a work dinner with my colleagues on the date that I'm traveling home. How should I go about this? Flights are too expensive to reschedule now. Is it unprofessional if I request to move the dinner earlier in the week? What's the right work etiquette to navigate this situation. Any help from managers on this subreddit are appreciated. Thanks!"
"
I've been at my company for about 2.5 years and with my current team for about 18 months. I love my job, my boss, and my team. I work as a data analyst, mostly doing data visualization. Lately my boss has been bringing me into more ad hoc analyst asks, which I have enjoyed. I'm also wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science in Spring '24. My career change from biz management to data analytics/CS is all but complete. I get roped into some CS work - like right now I'm doing some NLP in python to get sentiment analysis, common words/phrases used in customer feedback, etc 

Anyways, I moved down to Florida for my first job with this company in the midst of the lockdown in 2020. I've been in office maybe 10-12 times. This job I actually applied for was listed as fully remote, but HR changed me to local because I was here. Didn't love that. I think it's fair to say my team works best remote. My direct boss strongly aligns with how I feel, as does our Sr Engineer. We also have two junior analysts - one of which is remote because he was hired and lives in the Midwest. So there's precedent on our team.

We've gotten a new CEO. He spoke highly of hybrid work and hinted at imposing a 3 day a week mandate next year. For now, he's ""encouraging"" us to come in. He's pro hybrid, but not pro fully remote. I have been remote the last five years of my professional career. It's what works for me. I never want to sit in an office. I will come in bi weekly, quarterly, as needed. But I am building dashboards and doing ad hoc analytics. There's no need to sit next to my team. We communicate fine via Slack. When I work in office - I lost 2 hours of sleep, don't have time or energy for grad school at night, am just generally miserable. So far its been a non-issue, but our CEO has heightened my anxiety. My only leverage is I basically own our entire BI platform. It would be hard to replace me on a whim.

We're currently in our ""peak"" season. Everyone's swamped and stressed - especially my boss. But I'm losing sleep over this. And to make matters more complicated, I want to move out of Florida when my lease is up next May. I'd like to move to the Midwest in a state we also operate in. I am miserable and lonely here. I miss being near any family. I just can't stand it here. And there's no reason to stay.

Im just looking for advice when to talk to my boss and how to professionally discuss this request. My anxiety has me prepared for the worst. We speak weekly in one on ones but it's usually all time for actual work. I try not to rock the boat or be difficult, but being remote is the most important thing to me. Part of me thinks it's best to wait for peak to end, the other part of me thinks I shouldn't have to live with the anxiety. I'm glad she seems aligned with me on preferring remote, and I originally planned to speak with her in august when we do our yearly bonus/career conversation, but that was moved company wide to January. I'm just tired of constantly hearing about the office, office surveys, etc. I think our CEO was speaking generally vs specifically to me and my team but I hate the lack of certainty. I just cannot do the office and all the social and financial drain that comes with it - especially since I am so high performing. Before I was hired, we had this project contracted to a consulting firm where 3 people did my job. We've completely streamlined it since. 

Any advice?"
"I work from home on the computer all day, and I tend to get really sleepy a few times throughout the day, even when I get a full nights rest. Any advice plsssss?"
"I'm looking to hear from others in my position. I'm looking into potentially making the shift to WFH. I, like many of you here, hate the commute and mindless talks about weather with coworkers I barely know. 

I am a school psychologist working for a public district. My grad degree is in school psychology. I feel a bit pigeon-holed looking at remote jobs. 90% of what I see is software, data, and project management. Stuff I have zero experience in. 

I obviously don't want to make a lateral move here and would be looking to increase my income at least a little. For those that made the move into a different line of work, what did you do? Do I need to take some online courses, just apply and see what sticks, just keep looking?

I'm honestly open to anything except sales."
"I currently have one remote job, and seeking another to do along side it, I have an interview with another role that similar to my current role

If the new role ask for a reference from my current job what's the best way to answer, as getting a reference from my current role would notify my current company, which I don't want


Any advice?"
"I'm the owner of [SkipTheDrive](https://www.skipthedrive.com). I've been working like crazy on getting a lot more jobs in my database, and have \~27K remote jobs to choose from. Unlike some of my competitors, there's no charge for job seekers, so search away. Best of luck."
"Just looking for advice.. I work in an administrative type role and I am a salaried employee. I did not sign any kind of contract regarding hours at the time of employment. 

I have had set Monday - Friday hours since I began, no weekends or holidays. I found out today, that a new client has enrolled in our service and was promised / sold 24/7 access to speak to someone in my department.

We do not have staffing for this, and they anticipate volume to be lower, so instead of hiring overnight employees they are utilizing a call model. 

Today we received our new schedule and we are expected to take an entire week, 62 hours to be exact, of call on top of our regularly scheduled 40 hour week.. with the expectation that you will take one week per month. The call hours include weekends and holidays. 

I voiced my concerns to my supervisor, however unfortunately this is pretty out of their hands. They were sympathetic to the opposition I had to so much call, but stated their hands were completely tied. 

I overall enjoy my job, and of course am beyond grateful for the opportunity to work from home... but after today I'm honestly left a little shook that such a large scheduling change was just thrown at us. 

I have severe PTSD and require a sleep aid to sleep at night. I am mainly concerned I won't wake for the call in a manner that allows me to do my job, and therefore will have to go 7 full days without good sleep / nightmares. I voiced this to my supervisor as well. 

I am mainly looking for any advice or suggestion that would help me navigate this bizarre situation.. I am just at a loss. 

Thank you all for listening to me, and thanks in advance for any advice that can be given."
"I am moving from a large employer in-office job to a fully remote job with a company based in Florida. I will work from my home in Texas. The new company is a late-phase startup that offers limited benefits (health, vision, and dental plans, 401K with no company matching and that's it). Is there anything in the salary structure or benefits I can specifically ask for my new job that suits WFH?"

"As the title says, we are moving from full time, in person teaching in K12, to remote jobs this year. We also have an 8mo baby who will continue to be watched at home by my mother. 

It's not a huge place, it's 3bed/1bath, with one of the rooms built as an office. Desks are bought. My partner plans to use our bedroom, I'll use the office. We can't really roam from there since the soon to be crawling/walking menace will be around.

I couldn't find tips on the subreddit, even after searching. What are some ""new to WFH"" tips that can help make the transition as smooth as possible. 

What are some routines your family uses?"
"It's getting laughably obvious at this point what these corporate lackeys are trying to do. If you care to read it (I didn't), [this is the paper they base their article on](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqbngD8pemqxAkZmWCOQ32Yk6PXK9eVA/view)."
Since many of you work remotely full time I wanted to ask very broadly - what is your work culture feel like? Have you noticed any remote work norms / wfh etiquette that would differ from an in-person environment?
"Asking for a friend. 

I have 3+ years in inbound insurance sales (since Covid), and I am super grateful to work from home.. also paid pretty decently as far as customer service roles go ($24 an hour), which is good for Ohio cost of living...  

But I truly am wanting to know which careers (entry level?) one can get into that are not back to back phones based. 

(I  am interested in HR, but have no experience in it - even entry level roles I've seen want some experience in a human resources role).

Also not looking at the moment, as I'm pregnant and will be going on maternity leave in December... But thinking instead of coming back to my current job, of finding one I may enjoy more! 

Thank you! 

P.S. if it helps I have a bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management as far as education goes, but evidently have not used that degree in some time."

""In a new Gallup survey, the share of remote workers who said they felt a connection to the purpose of their organizations fell to 28% from 32% in 2022--the lowest level since before the pandemic. The findings are from a survey this spring and summer of nearly 9,000 U.S. workers whose jobs can be done remotely.

By contrast, a third of full-time office workers reported a similar sense of connection, nearly the same as last year. Hybrid workers clocked in highest, with 35% saying their companies' mission made them feel their jobs were important.""

"Just got a fully remote customer service job. Only doing incoming calls and still not sure what my schedule will be. They're sending me equipment in the next couple weeks.

General advice from those in similar positions? Pros and cons? Things you wish you knew or got ahead of time?"
"I work remote 90% of the time but go in as needed, but yesterday was the first time I stayed all day at the office and it was horrrrible! The planning, packing, rush hour, lack of stuff at the office since no one is practically there anymore, etc. Anyway, my step dad in law does not understand why we get to work from home and annoyingly tells me all the time it will not last lol I told him it is old school way of thinking but he said remote work is too new.

Also, the HR reddit page seems to hate on me too. I get snarky comments about working from home, I feel like I do not even want to go there for advice anymore. Not too many HR jobs are remote, so I wonder if it is just jealousy. I basically needed advicr about a coworker who is on-site and everyone basically was like poor her, she works at the building give her a break, you have a cushy remote job delegating tasks. But that was what she was hired to do lol we needed someone on site to check mail, file, and so she knew it was not remote. 

I only get grief about remote work from older people and people who don't get to work from home. It is a huge life change in a good way and I swear I work better comfortably and happily when I am home."
"I work at a company that transitioned from analog products to a SaaS company. It's been in operation for 20+ yrs.

I began work there during the pandemic (on the engineering side) and we were all wfh except for a warehouse employee and the owner. Although we're a SaaS we still have a hardware component. 

My boss was open to maintaining wfh for a while but says that sales have been less productive working remotely and he can't see how you could effectively train new sales people. Since the spring he has mandated RTO for all sales people and a hybrid schedule for non sales team members. 

I feel if we could effectively help get to a point where we could train a sales team for remote work we would be in a better position. For further context, most of our sales are initiated with an outbound approach. 

Does anyone have a good book or other resource to help us update our methods for a more remote friendly setup?"
"I have a Master of Science in Cybercrime and almost 3 years of remote work experience (I actually started just before the Pandemic). I've been applying to tons of Jobs on LinkedIn, Indeed as well as looking at local companies near me to see if anything is available.

2 months ago, I was let go from a remote Image Annotation job for a Machine Learning/A.I. company. I do prefer tech roles and I am learning to code but it will be several months before I can land a junior developer role.

In the mean time I need something. It seems tech jobs have become insanely competitive and a lot of tech companies are on hiring freeze. 

The only other WFH jobs I really find are call center type work or sales. I've never done that before, are there any good companies to work for? I don't feel comfortable with sales.

Even if a job only pays $35-$40K a year, I'm ok with that for now. I just need steady income."
"While I don't have issues setting boundaries outside of work hours, I struggle with taking a regular lunch break and disconnecting like i normally would in the office. Maybe it's because I'm already comfortable at home, whereas when you're in the office you can't wait to get out?  

I'm currently taking a break to go pick up a prescription and feel like I'm doing something I shouldn't..but nobody really cares because my manager is on vacation and I'm a proven hard worker. Has anybody struggled to move from their desk being remote?"
"When researching work from home jobs, i often have a very difficult time finding ones in iowa, for reasons that obviously are clear. Does anyone know of remote/work from home companies that also hire in Iowa? Thanks."

I work in a different state from my company and all my coworkers live 100s of miles away. How do you socialize while wfh? Coworking space? Coffee shops? Extracurriculars?
"I work from home and have not been into the office since December of 2018, even prior to that I had only gone in person a handful of times.  My boss and I have everything set up on a server and I use all of my own equipment, the only item I have is a flash drive from 4 years ago that is no longer used. 

I will be handing over my resignation via email and following up with a phone call as that is our main method of communication. I'm giving 3 weeks notice and have all my ducks in a line at the moment. 

How likely is it that I will be asked to go into the office? Is this commonly asked when you resign from an in home position? 

My new job is also 100% remote and I have terrible driving anxiety so in all honesty this unknown is what is worrying me the most about quitting.  I don't see why he would change things as I'm leaving and I don't really have anything to turn in but you never know.  Are there any ways around this if it does come up in conversation?"
"Hey all, 

Looking for some info! I currently work from home 4 days a week. I connect via VPN and I know team viewer runs in the background. 

Now I'm assuming they can access my laptop to view what I am doing / check up on me. My question is, at stages through the day my screen pixels will glitch but I've also noticed that lines will flash over my other devices such as phone , tv iPad etc. 

Could this be caused from them joining remote access? But would this affect my other devices too?? "
"Just a heads up that you can find plenty of remote/wfh opportunities on [SkipTheDrive](http://www.skipthedrive.com). Jobs range from web-dev, to customer service, data entry, project management, sales, etc.

"I'm in a very red state, and my family is not so red. It's becoming clearer day by day that it's unsafe for us to stay. I have been looking around for awhile for remote work, but I always seem to have the dumbest of luck. I've seen scam after scam, I've improved my resume a ton (even had some professional help), and I'm getting no feedback from applications. Just automated rejection. Being how things are, I'm feeling discouraged. I want to keep my family safe, and coming into a remote position would really help so we could move to anywhere without limitations. How do I find a REAL wfh job? Where do I start? (I've been on your typical sites like LinkedIn, zipRecruiter, JobBot, etc.)"
"If anybody has any leads on work remotely jobs that are hiring entry level please let me know. With our new baby coming any day now, I'll have to work more from home for the foreseeable future. I will still be open for taking private commissions on paintings, but my commercial art and mural output will see a hit im sure. Besides art, my experience is in team management, logistic problem solving, data entry, scheduling, marketing, and project management. I'm still going to go through the process of updating the resume, and hitting up all those ziprecruiter and monsterjob sites, but if I can work through or with someone I know I of course would enjoy that."
"Hello to all, I'm an EU national, mid-30s, an engineer working as a PM.

My wish is to leave my office job in Q1 '24 (before is not possible, for several reasons). 

Ideally, I'd like to find an asynchronous and remote position, so that I can travel with my van permanently (not mandatory tho).

Could you give me some suggestions on high-demand skills that I could acquire in 1 year of study? 

i.e. which SWE languages are mostly requested, other jobs that suit the description, etc.

I'm not looking for high-paying jobs only, I can live with a very basic income (800EUR/1000EUR) if nothing better pops up. Important detail: I don't want a PM position anymore, even if remote.

Many thanks for the help!"
"Hey everyone, the title says all. I just accepted a remote job and I'm really, really worried about the loneliness part. I'm actually one of those people that prefers the office, but I live in a small city and remote jobs pay way more than anything around here. 

I've looked at shared office spaces and I'll probably do that, but they are expensive. I want to try the first month or so from home. I also want to move to one of the cities where my company has offices, but I'm unable to for at least a year (mortgage stuff).

The hard part is living in a medium-sized city in the south and being single at 31. All my friends are married and have kids now and never want to hang out. I get most of my interaction with people at the office.

Sorry about the rambling. Just getting everything out there I guess."
"It's been tough trying to find work with this record and with not much job history to show for myself. I've been trying to turn my life around and I'm hoping that a remote job opportunity will give me the chance to prove myself.

I'm open to any and all advice on where to look for work-from-home or remote positions. I'm willing to start at an entry-level position and work my way up. I have a strong work ethic and I'm a fast learner. I'm just looking for a chance to show that I'm dependable and trustworthy.

I've been doing some research and have found a few companies that hire people with criminal records, but I would love to hear from anyone who has experience with this or has any advice on where to start. I'm also open to any suggestions on how to improve my chances of getting hired.

Thank you in advance for any advice or support you can offer. I'm determined to make a better life for myself and I appreciate any help I can get"

I asked to verify herself and she sent me a picture that to an unknowing eye had some clever edits in it but wasn't %100 clear of artifacts (digital evidence of editing) when I asked this person who posted to also verify herself I was told that if I was uncomfortable I don't have to continue ""a lot of people are looking for this job.""

I have to say this was heartbreaking, I'm one year into recovering from spine surgery my spouse left me and i'm running out of workers comp. I'm in desperate need of a job and vocation change as my back can't take labor anymore and I need to support myself. all I have is a clean identity and was sooo desperate to be given a chance I didn't see the red flags until she said ""Welcome to the team"" and then started to ask for personal information. it was at that point she wouldn't verify with me beyond this questionable picture. theres a part of me that wishes someone here would tell me its real, im that desperate. but if it isnt and it looks like its not. the hope given/ripped away from me is criminal. Reading all these posts calling them it all left me in tears. There may be soooo many people who like me need something like this to live to survive and if this is a scam god knows how many people are affected or destroyed by it beyond where they are at that moment. I'm desperate I need change I need to control my life and that starts with finding remote work and this experience crushed me, my spirit and has left me feeling hopeless.  If anyone can tell me otherwise I pray you can but confirming this isn't real either would be helpful. 

PS

If anyone here can maybe send suggestions for where to apply for remote work that would be greatly appreciated as I am in great need to get to work asap.

How can a person find a remote job from entry level. Like which field should they look into.
"I've been with my company for over 10 years, been a manager for 4, and am currently the succession plan for the department. During COVID, we worked fully remote for a year or so, then they instituted a hybrid policy. The company is not entirely opposed to remote work, but it's certainly an exception. My family and I have decided to move to another state however, and I informed my management of this recently. We technically have an office in the state I'm going to, but I'll be nowhere near it. This is good news because it means I can remain an employee and continue to have benefits, vacation, etc. rather than convert to a contractor like the one person who's done this before me. 

My boss and our VP are positive about the move, citing nothing will change from a raise or promotion schedule, they won't dock pay only adjust up for COL, they'll work something out with the company to pay for my return once a quarter, and to ultimately not worry: I have a job. What my role really looks like, and the career trajectory is at this point is an unknown, because again, they were targeting me for VP and running the department. Those promises sound great and all, but I'll be the first to do this and remain an employee at my level, setting a big precedent, and it still has to be approved by the president, and maybe the board. 

My question to this community: what do I need to get in writing so that I'm not screwed once I move?

"Hey Guys,

I'm new to the group. I was just wondering if any of you had thoughts on what makes remote working easier for you? Is it software, tech, furniture? Is there anything your employers could supply to make the adjustment easier?

I personally think I could do with a good desk, I'm currently working from my sofa A trip to IKEA might be needed!

Let me know your thoughts, I'm interested to hear!"
"Picture this: You're in your work environment, and you receive a scan of a document. Accompanying it is a file that you have to edit/correct based on the information in the document. For instance, maybe the file is missing the name of the person it's about. So you sift through the documents included to find that person's name, you type it out in the ""Name"" field or whatever, and then you release record. You do this over and over again a few hundred times, and then you clock out for the day.

I used to have a job like that, but because it wasn't remote, they provided the computer. I'm wondering if remote versions of this job exist, and if they provide the equipment for it. Because it's not like a call center where you need a special phone. Just a computer and a means to access/transmit the information. To that point, if you have one of these jobs, is it freelance? Because it sounds like the kind of job where you bring your own computer and they pay you as an independent contractor. Sort of like those ""Fill in these Excel sheets"" temporary gigs. 

I would like to do this work again, except full time and from home. I'll buy a Chromebook for it if I have to."
"My current manager allows us hybrid (2 days a week at home). The main reason we're not fully remote is because another group in our department has to always be on site. So the days in office are for ""collaboration"" (which barely even happens) and likely so the other group doesn't totally hate us if we were fully remote. I have a pretty open line of communication with her and I'm very experienced in my position so I know she values me. What it be worth mentioning that I'm considering applying to another position in the company that allows fully remote to give her the chance to reconsider? Or is this maybe not a smart idea?"

"I am being promoted to a leadership position from a short-lived team lead position (I was an IC before that). I am a software engineer for a fully-remote tech startup.

I personally prefer to do most things async on Slack/Notion/Google Docs/Github - and people have told me that I keep track of various Slack threads better than others. I find video calls to be highly disruptive to my productivity.

Others are more overwhelmed with Slack threads and prefer to do Zoom calls. They share that for them, it is the opposite: async communication is disruptive to their productivity.

For those working from home full time or are part of a remote company, how do distinguish between  using async communication vs having a synchronous video call? My mandate now revolves around making the entire team more productive and efficient, not just my personal work output, and I find this difference in working style to be a difficult gap for me to bridge."

" 

I'm about 27 years old, originally from Italy, and currently living in France.I am living in France because my profession is paid nuts in my homecountry.

At the moment, I'm a physiotherapist, and I'm about to start a 5-year osteopathy school, which costs 30,000 euros and will occupy 4-5 days of every month. I decided on this path because I signed a contract that will grant me about 30,000 euros (essentially covering the osteopathy course cost) if I stay working as a physiotherapist here for 5 years.

My net worth right now is around 20,000 euros.

I'd appreciate some guidance as I'm quite confused about my next steps.

My ultimate goal is financial freedom with passive or semi-passive income streams.I know it's challenging, but it's what I aspire to.From my research and learning, I concluded that building an online business might be the answer. However, I currently lack any IT skills.Moreover, I believe that establishing an online business is intricate and might demand a lot of time. Reflecting on my major goal of financial freedom, I realized that dealing with many people physically every day is draining me physically, psychologically, and emotionally. Additionally, I feel trapped in this city and country when I'd love to experience life in different parts of the world, something my current job doesn't allow.

I considered an intermediate step to study and acquire a skill that would allow me to have a 100% remote job that I can perform anywhere.

My questions are:

1. In your opinion, is it easier to find a 100% remote job starting from a position where I have no qualifications, or is it simpler to establish an online business?
2. Is it feasible to find a well-paid or even moderately paid remote job without any qualifications but by committing to serious study for some time? If yes:

. Which skill should I focus on? Perhaps web developer?

. Where should I study?

. Realistically, how long might it take?

3) I should start osteopathy in September. However, as I've mentioned, I dream of financial freedom and a remote job that allows me to travel and live in different parts of the world. Is it truly worth undertaking this course? The only potential advantage I see is leveraging this additional qualification to create an online business later. Moreover, if I want that 30,000 euro bonus, I must stay in France for five years; otherwise, I'd be obliged to repay the initial money given to me.

Thank you so much for your answers"
"I was contacted by a recruiter a couple weeks ago about a job that would be a good next step for me and come with a nice raise. The description mentioned remote or in-person, so I clarified with the recruiter that I live 3 hours away and would not be able to be in-person regularly, although I would be willing to travel on occasion. He confirmed with the employer that fully remote would be acceptable, as most of the team is only in once a week. We scheduled a call and talked for 20-30 mins, after which he agreed to move me forward in the process.

He set up an interview with the hiring manager, which went well. We discussed my location and the fact that I would need to be fully remote, with occasional travel as a possibility. I was told again that they are open to having someone fully remote in this role.

Yesterday, I got an invitation to an interview with the CIO for this afternoon, which I spent the last 24 hours preparing for. I join the zoom call and he asks where I'm calling in from and we chat a bit about my location and why I chose to move here. He then asks if I'm aware that this is a one day a week in person position and I have to explain that no, I spoke in detail about my situation with multiple people and was told that fully remote was an option. He tells me they have this policy and can't make exceptions. We agree to end the call, because I'm not going to commute 3 hours each way (honestly more like 4 with rush hour traffic).

Huge waste of my time and energy. I'm lucky that I have a remote job already, but you would think companies would work this stuff out before the 3rd goddamn interview."
"Hi everyone, I work from home for a large company in New Zealand. I'm an accountant. 

I used to live in the UK and I'm planning on moving back.

I would like to take my job with me as it's a remote job and it will be one less thing to do when I move back. Plus I would like to apply for a Spanish digital nomad visa in the future, so continuing this job and having a track record of working remotely will be really helpful.

The problem is the time difference. NZ and UK are almost exactly opposite - their day is our night and our day is their night, there's very little overlap where I can speak to my colleagues on Teams/zoom etc. Despite this, I am willing to try and make it work. I mean, we do have the weekly team meeting on Teams but other than that I mostly communicate with my colleagues through emails and chats (not phone calls). I am willing to finish everything a day or two earlier (so deadlines are met NZ time and also to leave a little time for questions and reviews) and stay late or wake up super early to make/answer calls if it's absolutely necessary. I can even go part time so that I am able to finish everything on time NZ time and perhaps leave behind work that requires constant communication. 

How do I convince my boss to let me take the job to the UK? Do you know anyone who works remotely in a different time zone? Please help me, people of the internet  Thank you so much in advance."

"Hi everyone,

I'm a recent grad trying to break into IT, but the only job in the field I've been able to land is project-based and I'm only working about one day every two weeks. I am supposed to have the car I drive handed over to me, which requires me to pay for insurance. I'd rather not have to quit the only job I'm getting usable experience from, and I would rather not juggle a second in-person job with a commute until I can make sure the car is as fixed up and reliable as possible.

Does anyone have any ideas (IT-related or not) for part-time remote work I could do while I get a few more months of experience in IT? I've tried applying for data entry and CSR positions, but many of the data entry positions seem sketchy, and I tried a few simulations while applying for CSR positions and many of those, especially the phone-based ones, really overwhelmed me with their KPIs and other metrics. So if I am going to be a CSR I'd prefer if it was chat/email-based. I am also not super comfortable with sales and recruiting, particularly cold-calling.

I know this is a lot of restrictions, but I was hoping that with a bachelor's degree I'd at least have a few options. The field of study is information systems and supply chain management, with a concentration in information systems, if that helps."

"In my search for a new WFH job, I am searching for strictly remote positions on LinkedIn and Indeed.  However, I see a lot of posts that list a city and state, and remote next to it in parentheses.

"Hi all; was hoping someone out there had some advice for me. 

I graduated with my masters in human resource management last December after getting my bachelors degree in multidisciplinary studies (AKA three minors in communication, business administration, and economics). I never felt particularly drawn to a certain field of study or career path, so I figured HR would be good as I am a very empathetic person who gets enjoyment from helping people.

About three months ago, I started my job as an HR associate for a college in the city I moved to after graduating. What I'm quickly realizing is that my social anxiety (paired with my general anxiety and depression) can get the better of me when I have to communicate with a large amount of people. I also don't enjoy much of my work, which consists of vague instructions and parameters from my sometimes rude teammates. I enjoy the days I get to work remote (away from the random pop ins at work and random characters on my commute). Essentially, I'm not very happy.

I'm hoping somebody out there knows of any job opportunities that would be fully remote, low stress, and that I will be qualified for. I've always enjoyed proofreading and helping clean up friend's papers and resumes, spending hours getting lost down a rabbit hole on the Internet reading about obscure topics or finding niche and specific information, organizing and tidying things up, and simple/basic math. I don't have any coding experience, so that field is pretty much scratched out. Direct and straight job tasks would be ideal. Additionally, I would probably need to make above the mid $50k's to support my household. 

So in conclusion, I'm looking to move away from my current HR job to a fully remote opportunity that's low stress and introvert friendly. Any suggestions would be great!"

"Has anyone noticed employers listing the same position in multiple cities (where they don't seem to have an office) rather than listing them as remote? I'm thinking specifically of postings on LinkedIn which has ""remote"" as a location option, but I'm sure there are others.

I suppose they could be trying to only get applications from states they already have employees in to save a paperwork and keep payroll costs down, but they are also ruling out a whole mess of people  those states who aren't near the dozen cities they advertise in. 

I guess the take away is: if like me, you have a fairly specialized skill set and want to work remote from a more rural location, you might want to look at job listings in the nearest city or two of size and investigate the ones you like. If you see they don't seem have an office in the city its probably remote, especially if you also see it posted in other cities without offices.

I was also just approached on LinkedIn about two different positions that were not advertised as remote, in cities that are 4+ hours from the city listed in my profile. I wish I'd asked why they weren't advertised as remote, but in both cases the employers said they would be fine with me working from home."
"I'm 6 months into a fully remote leadership role in a large NGO (think: World Vision/Oxfam). I love the small team I supervise (4 of us in different time zones), salary is 90k, and organizational culture is great. I've gathered with my 15 person department in person a couple times in Chicago and DC and they are all the real deal. I feel so fortunate. 

Don't get me wrong - I love the flexibility of remote work. My previous job was a hybrid situation with tons of flexibility. I would not ever go back to an in office 9-5 unless there were dire circumstances. I'm 40 with a couple kids in a MCOL city and love the flexibility + access to jobs like mine that I couldn't get before without moving. 

All this good stated, I'm having a hard time with the remote experience. I am energized by (the right kind of) people and meaningful communication. I do like the quiet of my house a couple days of week, but every day being alone and grinding it out/all the Zoom meetings are not life-giving to me. I have a co-working space membership and a few favorite coffee shops, but they just feel like places I get distracted...the relationships I can make there don't lead to the trust-building needed to get complex work done as they aren't my colleagues. 

I miss having my top 3 colleagues from my previous job in the vicinity where we huddle up, whiteboard it out, crack open a few beers after.  WFH can't offer a direct equivalent for this, but I wonder what you'd recommend I try after getting a sense of my situation/personality.  I need life giving work rhythms. 

For example, one thing I do is block an hour for errands or running in the middle of the day so that I get out of the house intentionally. Another thing I'm trying is to plan coffee or happy hour meetings with friends throughout the days for intentional connection (though not work related). 

That said, I am still not fully content with the rhythm of my days. What suggestions do you have?"
"So a quick background:
I'm 22F with a part time job at a daycare at the local school. It was my first official job and I have been employed there since 2019 in various positions. Most, if not all, of my experience is in child care since I have regularly cared for my 6yo nephew since he was born. I have never been interested in college and I have no plans of ever enrolling. 

The thing is, I don't like children. I do not see myself being able to work in my current position for much longer. I do not see myself furthering my career in that field. My goal right now is to find a different job in a work-from-home/remote position. Ultimately I want to have a fully remote career (with decent pay obv) so eventually I can start traveling. 

I have been looking into finding some kind of position in tech since I've heard that's where most wfh jobs come from, but I've become very overwhelmed by the amount of options. I'm not even sure if I even know all the options. I'm not even sure if tech is the right option/career field. However, I have started (veryyyyy slowly) trying to teach myself how to code through Codecademy. 

Is it possible to find something without any experience/degrees?  
Any recommendations/tips would be very appreciated. Any advice or steps to follow would also be extremely helpful."
"Good morning,

I'm 27 years old and currently work as a physiotherapist, living in Paris although I'm Italian.I would like some practical advice. I plan to stay in France for another five years to study osteopathy and save up money to buy a house in Italy. However, my goal is to have a 100% remote job that allows me to live anywhere in the world, working solely from a PC.I aspire to a digital nomad lifestyle, and in these 5 years while I'll be in France, I'm willing to use my free time to acquire the necessary skills for such a job, which I know it will almost surely be in an unrelated field to mine.

The job should be:

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.

. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated

. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study

. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

. As stress-free as possible

Which path should I pursue?

Thank you very much in advance for your insights, have a wonderful day"
"Hi, I'm new to reddit but basically I just got let go from my dispensary job after a mass layoff. It took me a year to find this job with almost a decade of customer service experience with a bachelors degree in criminal justice. I'm not too worried about finding something in my field at the moment, it would be nice to find an activist organization or something to work for but with covid I'm honestly not sure what to do with my degree and law enforcement is not an option for me. I have customer service experience so I wouldn't mind doing it from home especially after my last job caused a lot of anxiety because I have honestly never dealt with customers this entitled and abusive even working at a grocery store for 5 years prior and I can't bear the thought of going back to retail. I remember how hard it was to find a remote job with all the scams the last time I looked for one (I got scammed by American Income Life on LinkedIn lol) and I'm just wondering where I should look? I feel like I'm going to run into the same problems and it's going to drive me insane like last year and I genuinely don't think I can live like that again."
"Hi everyone,

I'm new to Reddit and I'm excited to join this community and learn from all of you. I'm currently working from home due to the pandemic, and I'm looking for ways to improve my remote workspace.

I've noticed that my productivity has been a bit inconsistent lately, and I think it might be because my home office isn't as comfortable or functional as it could be. I'm hoping to make some changes to help me focus better and be more productive.

Here are a few ideas that I'm considering:

1. Upgrading my chair: I've been using an old office chair that isn't particularly comfortable or supportive. I'm thinking about investing in a new ergonomic chair to help me stay comfortable and reduce back pain.
2. Adding more natural light: I don't have a lot of windows in my home office, so it can feel a bit dark and gloomy in there. I'm thinking about getting a desk lamp that simulates natural light to help me stay alert and focused.
3. Organizing my workspace: My desk is currently a bit cluttered and disorganized, which can be distracting. I'm planning on decluttering and reorganizing to create a cleaner, more efficient workspace.

Do you have any other suggestions for improving a remote workspace? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thanks in advance for your help!"
"In a PwC survey of 120 US executives, 83% said: ""the shift to remote work has been successful for their company."" On the other hand, only 5% of those executives believe they can maintain company culture with a fully remote workforce.

Answer: It's a trick question. It doesn't have to be one or the other.

You can take the benefits of remote work--flexibility, efficiency, etc.--and still retain the benefits of in-person work. In short, there is a middle way. 

But to walk that middle way, you need a roadmap. You need a remote work policy.

So in this post, we'll start with the basics: what a remote work policy is and why you need one. Then we'll get into the steps required to create and implement a remote work policy.

To wrap things up, we'll share a remote work policy template that you can adapt for your own organization. 

## What is a Remote Work Policy?

A remote work policy spells out your company's rules for remote working. This could include, but isn't limited to, rules governing:

1. Who is eligible for remote work
2. How much remote work will be allowed
3. Professional expectations for remote workers
4. Home work station equipment requirements and allowances
5. Network security
6. Time tracking (for hourly workers)

In short, a [remote work policy](https://www.hugo.team/blog/remote-work-policy) spells out guidelines for employees who work from any location other than a company office. The policy's goal is to maximize the benefits of remote work for the company and employees.

## Why You Need a Remote Work Policy

There are both strategic and logistical reasons you need a remote work policy. In the next two subsections, we'll cover both these categories.

### Remote Work as a Competitive Advantage

Remote work policies fall under the purview of human resources. But the strategic impact of these policies is company-wide.

In fact, for some organizations, such as InVision, GitLab, Synchrony, or Atlassian, successfully enabling remote work is a key competitive advantage. Yet InVision and GitLab are fully remote, while Synchrony and Atlassian are testing a hybrid model.

In short, these companies press the advantages of remote work in different ways. 

The key for your organization is to understand where and how you can (and can't) press the advantages of remote work.

Among other things, a few advantages and benefits remote work provides include:

1. Reduced real estate costs (i.e. office rent)
2. Expanded access to a larger pool of talented workers
3. Eliminated or greatly reduced commute times
4. Improved ability to attract and retain talent
5. Enhanced employee productivity, well-being, and freedom

Once you've done the legwork to determine how remote work best fits at your company, you need the policy to codify your findings.

### Planning Your Transition to Hybrid or Remote Work

There was no planning for the transition to remote work caused by Covid-19. But sometime in the future, the virus will stop dictating terms. So there's time to plan.   


And according to Nicki Bellington, Atlassian's head of talent programs, ""\[Remote work\] is not like a light switch. We want to crawl and walk and then see how far we run.""  


Both the process of creating your policy, and the document itself, will help you and your employees start to crawl, walk, and then run with remote work."
"I'm the owner of [SkipTheDrive.com](https://www.skipthedrive.com/), a site for people seeking remote employment. I'm constantly bringing in jobs from companies, and have nearly 27,000 jobs in my database. Today I noticed some popular companies with opportunities, namely:

* Twilio
* GoDaddy
* Culture Amp
* Translucent
* Bynder
* and more...

I'm always looking to improve my site, so feedback is welcome."
"We believe the nature of ""work"" is changing and moving away from the traditional ""home vs. office model"". We hope to help with that transition and make sure it proceeds smoothly.

"This will be my first WFH job; training will be in person, but fully remote after that. Potential for permanent job depends on turnover, so the position I'm taking on will go away.

"I was hired through a recruitment agency for a job as an Order Support Specialist for a pretty large company. I was told because of my pretty decent typing test scores, that I would be ideal for mostly data entry and as an overflow for the phone support focused employees. I have a few questions for anyone in a similar situation.

Context: I've worked 8 jobs at this point in my life ranging from taking insurance claims in a call center, to working as a customer representative, to driving a forklift in a warehouse. I've never worked a remote job, though most of my background and education is based in Computer Science. So therefore I really have no idea what to expect. My last job was a warehouse so I was lifting up to 50 pounds or more regularly throughout a 10+ hour shift. I'm used to really pushing myself physically to maintain a high level of work performance. I'm worried about going stir crazy sitting without chain-vaping or constantly snacking and drinking lol.

1. Any experience with remote training where you have to be on camera for 8 hours? Not sure at all about etiquette as far as eating and drinking. And I know this a dumb question but I have to ask. Is a discrete drag from a vape, very occasionally without distracting others, acceptable? Common sense says no but....
2. Anyone with a similar job, am I likely to have time once I start the actual job, to get up and go check in with my fiance and 3 year old daughter? I guess I'm asking if it's at all common to have some downtime throughout the day when you're doing a job that's mostly just responding to emails. Even if it's just a few minutes here and there. It's a little hard to imagine completely ignoring them from the next room over for 8 straight hours not including my break. Seems like some of the appeal in having a remote job. I'd probably be a little disappointed if I was glued to the chair the entire shift every day.
3. Any random insight that you think might be helpful? Anything will be helpful at this point.

Thanks in advance to anyone who offers up some insight!"
"Long story short, we work from home across the country (USA), not just in one state. My coworker has a disability that is triggered mainly by sounds.

We take phone calls daily, as well as answer emails and texts. My coworker has asked to be allowed to work on non-calls throughout the day, at least for the majority of their day.

Originally it was declined due to ""business needs"", however they are now hiring new employess for a role that does emails only. At the same time, they are telling my coworker that if they don't adhere to their required phone time, they will be fired.

Any advice for this coworker? They have other disabilities but I want to limit information for privacy's sake; the seizures are the main issue anyways."

"Hello everyone, I'm wondering if there is a site or list of all the companies that are fully remote and let you work from anywhere in the world? Or at least almost anywhere. I've seen a lot of companies offering remote options, but most of them don't specify if you can work anywhere or it's only remote within the US. I plan on not staying in the US long term, so I'm looking specifically for companies that don't care where you live in the world. I'll maintain an address and residency somewhere for tax purposes, but I want the freedom to travel to different places around the world while I work and not have to worry about my employer caring or finding out. Which companies allow this? Has anyone made a list or should we compile one together?

Your thoughts?"

"Hello, I've recently recovered from a huge depression in my life and decided to get back into the workforce, I don't have much experience or marketable skills so I catered my CV towards entry level roles like customer service/data entry. (I have a BIG employment gap)

 I recently got a remote role in customer service but the company has horrendous reviews from previous employees, typical stuff for these service roles (bad managers, cruel hours, terrible office) and the contract previously advertised (9 month 9-5) has changed to a 1 year 11-7.   It has a base salary of PS18,500 with KPI ontop so is not entirely commission dependent and the entirety of the role still hasn't been made apparent to me. The role is just 'Customer Service RDT'.

I've been a sedentary person all my life but the prospect of face to face work ontop of crazy commutes where I live made remote work very attractive

I'm getting some crazy anxiety and mood swings thinking about it, did I make a mistake? Also, what professions are remote friendly and how do I go about getting appropriate qualifications and credentials for future remote friendly roles (like data entry or something idk)

Apologies in advance if this is the wrong subreddit to talk about this I was gauging /r/anxiety or this."

"Is it possible to get entry-level job or internship at an US, UK, Australia or Canada (any good international country) company with that much experience? My main goal being work life balance and positive company culture.
I have been trying to apply jobs but as I can't relocate to those countries, I need companies which have worldwide remote teams, prefer WFH culture and pays good.

"I've been looking at a few different companies in search of a remote job, and I often see some jobs that say remote US and some that say remote CA, TX, etc. What are they saying here? Does remote US mean that you can work remote from anywhere in the US, whereas remote CA means you can work remote, but only if you live in California?

I'm assuming that is what it means, but it doesn't make sense that I would have to live in a specific state if I am working remote anyway."

"Hi everyone, my name is Angel and I am working on a project helping remote workers! I figured that some of us who work from home might be in the process of changing a job right now and I could probably help!.  
Basically, it's a simple job board, but it's probably the most complete and well-updated one out there (at least I haven't found others like it). What makes it special is that it's remote-exclusive frontend and backend jobs aggregator, sourcing data from more than 22 different places (most popular job boards) in a single place.  
Everything is checked and all data-discrepancies are filled manually by me (for now). So if you are only looking for remote frontend jobs with salaries, this is the place to go because I am trying to extract that information from each offer and classify it so it's easily visible in the job description :)  
I've already sold a couple of featured ads too!

I hope my project helps any of you who are looking for a remote job. I am also open for feedback (any kind of it really), so please share it!

Here are the links [https://remotefrontendjobs.com](https://remotefrontendjobs.com/) and [https://remotebackendjobs.com](https://remotebackendjobs.com/).

Thank you all,

Angel"

"Working with IT in NY and planning to move to a cheap state. Just got a new job recently where I'm currently working from home but that will change once life gets back to normal. I have a good relationship with my new boss and I can work very well remotely. I feel more productive remote than working at the office because I don't like office BS and imposed socialization.

The rest of the time I could just respond to emails from my phone if necessary, and no one would be the wiser."
"I just recently graduated from college with a Bachelor's in Network Administration, and would love to be able to put it to work, as you can do many admin tasks remotely these days.

My issue for this, however, is that I have years of desktop experience that I was unable to turn into server experience.  I got my degree so that I could have the basics of Windows Server (which centered on 2012), but a lot of what I find they want 5 years experience on top of the degree.

Where could I look for WFH jobs where I could get my feet wet with just the educational knowledge to get real world experience?  I'm not solely stuck to Windows.  I have experience with Linux (not scripting but I can set up services and modify config files) and macOS so I would hope someone would find a varied background as a plus.

Thanks for any tips!"
"Hi all 

What's the easiest remote job to get into using just a laptop?

I want to earn about EUR200 a week for 20 hours a week when I travel next 

EUR200 a week goes far in South East Asia 

Not sure Customer Care type stuff would suit me

My strengths and CV for remote working would lean towards audio editing and voice overs, both seem to just have one off gigs though 

Is there anything I can train up on for EUR200 a week from a Umedy course? 

This is for 2021 as this year is a complete write off  

But I'd like to start training/preparing for it now while I've some free time 

Thanks"

The [FlexJobs career coaching team](https://www.flexjobs.com/career-coaching-resume-review) offers these tips to remote job seekers who do not hold a bachelor's degree:

For Jobs that Say They Require a Degree

Job descriptions often state that they require an advanced degree, which is frustrating for job seekers who know they could do the job even though they lack this credential. Here's what to do:

* If the job description requires a general ""bachelor's degree"" or ""college degree,"" you can apply even if you don't have one. As long as you're confident you could do the job based on your experience and skills, go ahead and apply.
* On your resume, in the Education section, add a line such as, ""10+ years of experience in lieu of a bachelor's degree"" or ""2 years of coursework completed towards Bachelor of Science in Accounting"" so the keywords ""bachelor's degree"" appear on your document.
* In your cover letter, do a thorough job explaining how you meet many of the other requirements.

For Jobs Where You Don't Match All the Requirements

If you match 60-70% of the qualifications, consider applying. A job description is a wishlist from an employer and they'll almost certainly not wind up hiring someone with most or all of the qualifications. Studies find that many job seekers, especially women, hold themselves back from applying if they don't match the vast majority of the job requirements.

These skills and experience can be helpful to securing a job without a college degree.

* A high school diploma
* Some college experience
* Equivalent work experience
* Fluency in a second language
* Special skills, such as Microsoft Office proficiency
* Volunteer work
* Demonstrated growth mindset and taking initiative to educate and train yourself

"Remote work is great for some jobs. Maybe even millions of jobs. But early-stage startups? Maybe not. The spontaneous collision of insights is vital for an early-stage startup.

I'm considering relocating to Germany. Will I be okay to continue remoting into a desktop in Canada from Europe, so long as my internet connection is solid?"
"Hi friends. I'm working from home using a remote access network that lets me virtually use my Windows 10 (version 1903) from home. It works pretty well, except I get a huge amount of lag when the system is displaying very basic system animations. For example, resizing and dragging a window or scrolling down a page, or closing windows. It seems like it is anything where the window ""fades"" as it is closing, or is moving a big panel of text around.

Is there any kind of setting change in Windows I can find to reduce these graphics?"

"If you work remotely, asynchronous communication is a necessity. That's why it's important to understand the difference between asynchronous and synchronous communication, as well as when it's appropriate to use one or the other.

Asynchronous communication allows for asynchronous dialogue to take place - meaning that people can respond whenever they have time, rather than at a specific time like with synchronous communication.

## Definitions: Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Communication

**Synchronous communication** is when two or more people communicate at the same time, like in a chat room where everyone is typing messages simultaneously.

**Asynchronous communication** is when each person communicates one after another. Yes, this can be slower than synchronous because there are gaps between responses. But, it can also be more thoughtful and structured, and it works even if you aren't in the same place, time zone, or continent.

## 7 Tips For Better Remote Communication

Rather than debate the merits of async vs. sync, it's easier to understand when to use either mode of communication through these tips and best practices of how and when to use either.

### 1-Set expectations for asynchronous communication.

When you're working on a project with a remote team, assume asynchronous communication is the best method. Then explain to your team that people should generally be checking in at their convenience and not necessarily exactly when they receive an email or message from another person. That way, people won't be constantly monitoring their inbox, and can instead focus on their work.

### 2-Always send follow-up messages if you don't hear back from the other person.

If you don't hear back from someone, send another message to check-in. If it's still not clear that there was an issue with the communication channel or if your colleague didn't get your original email or Slack message, try doing an audio call as a Slack huddle or even using a regular voice call and ask for clarity.

>**Remember**: Asynchronous communication can get missed, so be sure to follow up with your team and ask for clarification.

### 3-Meet in person if you're working on a project together or are able to do so.

Even if you're a fully remote team, from time to time it's great to get together in person. Being together in a space will help you develop deeper bonds with your colleagues, which will ultimately help you with onboarding new hires.

When you are working together in person or can get together for a meetup, asynchronous communication is not as necessary because the context of the conversation is much more clear since there's no possibility of miscommunication through asynchronous means like email.

Meetups also allow remote workers the opportunity to get out of their homes or workspaces and interact with other people in real life.

### 4-Use asynchronous communication for work conversations that need structure, and synchronous communication when emotions are involved.

One of the most important things to remember is that asynchronous communication isn't appropriate for every type of conversation. If you need a quick answer, or if feelings are involved, it's best to have synchronous conversations so people can respond as soon as they're able.

When working with your team on projects and tasks, asynchronous communication usually works best.

Synchronous communication is best when dealing with urgent issues, such as emergencies and disasters.

### 5-Remember asynchronous vs synchronous isn't always black and white.

Some conversations are more suited to asynchronous or synchronous methods of discussion depending on the circumstances. Sometimes a hybrid approach is necessary.

A meeting is a good example. Before a meeting, collaborate asynchronously on the meeting agenda, sharing discussion topics and any materials to review beforehand. This makes the synchronous time--the meeting itself--far more efficient and valuable. After the meeting, again, you can follow through on action items asynchronously.

**Go Further **Use a meeting management tool like Hugo to manage all the async aspects of your meetings (agendas, notes, tasks, etc...)

### 6-Be aware of the impact asynchronous communication can have on your team and how it makes you feel.

It's important to know that asynchronous communication is slower than synchronous, which means people will take longer to get back to you when using asynchronous methods. This also takes a toll emotionally because you're not able to communicate in real-time with other people.

First, be respectful of the other person's time by sending messages at appropriate times rather than constantly checking in to see if they've checked their inbox yet. Asynchronous communication can feel emotionally draining, as you're not communicating in real-time with team members and instead have to wait around for responses, so if something is urgent, make that clear.

If this sounds like something that might affect your productivity or happiness on a remote team, consider changing up how much asynchronous vs synchronous communication happens on your team. If you need to give feedback on this, do so.

### 7-Know the strengths of async vs sync.

Asynchronous communication is better for planning and asynchronous tasks, while synchronous communication works best in urgent or emotional situations where you need an immediate response from another person.

Synchronously communicating with your team will give them a more realistic sense of what it's like to work on a remote team since they'll be able to check things off their to-do list faster.

Synchronous communication is always better for urgent matters, but asynchronous actually often works best when you need people's undivided attention and time on a project or task.

And remember that async vs sync isn't an all-or-nothing type of thing, even for remote teams and hybrid teams. Many conversations happen somewhere in between, with elements of asynchronous and synchronous communication.

"I'm having a very difficult time onboarding, probably made much harder by remote onboarding. In the past, I've onboarded much more easily.

It's been about 7 months, and feel like it's month 1, if that, in terms of how onboarding at my previous company went. Something has to change.

I'm not sure if it is because I'm onboarding as a senior engineer as well, I suspect that might be adding to the coldness and struggle to get relaxed and informal handholding help from someone. I don't want to bias and say where I'm working, but this is supposedly one of the best places to work in the world, and I nearly doubled my already pretty huge salary by accepting an offer here. I'm just totally mind blown that either I @#$%ing suck (part of it) or just their onboarding is god awful. I don't want to say the company as it will probably reveal who I am, but it's similar to Netflix in size and culture I would guess (at least it's public image before I joined and am fairly disappointed LOL!).

Some examples of challenges faced:

* I don't have a mentor
* I'm was given a mentor after asking, but they don't do anything close to what I do, was nice to talk to them a bit but the person always rubbed me like I was wasting their @#$%ing time, so we decided to stop meeting
* My manager isn't technical and can't help in any way other than say ""do it in parallel for greater productivity"" and similar. And also way too busy to help.
* On my first project, was able to find a mentor out of the closest person to this project.
   * Typical responses to questions were hours
   * Whenever we met on video, he would just dominate the conversation and go off on stories and hours pass without making much progress on the questions I'm screen sharing and want to discuss
   * I spent a lot of time building in our system and dealing with bugs here. Even while screen sharing, he never pointed out a very simple tool I should have been using that he uses every day to cache and speed up the build. Even when I explicitly asked several times, ""Surely you guys must have something to cache builds here? Is this what you do?""
   * Refused to screenshare and let me see how he worked, said it would be a waste of time
* Now 3 months in, on my second project, was also able to find a mentor out of the closest person on the project. Also have a new manager. Again though, the manager isn't technical, extremely busy, no help.
* Entire team is dead silent. There's no chat group, people talking about things, very little shared code and code review. No emails between teammates that I can tell. Everyone does their own thing and owns their own project with their own customers. We do somewhat similar things. I've asked just about everyone if there's a chat room I'm missing out on and told there isn't. I made one. No one really uses it, yet. I suspect/hope there are others like me that just were afraid to look different or make the first move.
* Throughout this time, I've been setting up 1:1s with people regularly (2-3 per week rotating around the team, nearby teams, and meeting people I see in the code blame), taking notes on what people do, trying to ask everyone a few questions and read and study the documentation as much as possible
* Everyone I've asked for a ""can I look over your virtual shoulder on how you use tool such and such"" or even just ""mind if we do a short pair programming or pair work / pair think for 20m, just grab me whenever for a video call"" have been shut down.
* I gave the ""can I look with anyone on what they're already doing"" ask in a team meeting as well, and my manager spoke up and said it was a poor idea and a waste of people's time, couldn't imagine why I would benefit from that. I explained that there's so much tribal knowledge and disconnect between the docs for the tools and actually using the tools, such as the check it and uncheck it random box is the secret to building some things (that no doubt wasted two hours of everyone on the team unless they got help or picked up on it from watching someone do it), that watching others work fluidly and being immersed will help a ton. (I didn't think this needs to be explained to anyone, but here I find myself)
* I eventually got a few people to screen share, and it was the weirdest experience. This one person shared the screen of a docs and was reading docs with me which is cool, finally getting somewhere. Then it turns out he was coding in a different monitor. When I realized this, I asked, can you share the coding screen or somehow work in one monitor for this session? He sighed, said no, that he works in two monitors. I asked okay can you share the one with code then? Another sigh and did it. He silently coded a few things, and then a long pause. I didn't want to interrupt him or anything, but after 5 minutes went by with silence and nothing happening, I asked ""watcha thinking?"", and he replied ""I'm thinking this is a waste of both of our time""
* The other person I screen shared with, this time I got to drive (woohoo, was not expecting that) would just bark micromanaged orders at me. ""Barrel equals"" ""drop dot seventeen dot data dot getBarrel parenthesis"" delete that line"" ""semicolon"" ""hover your mouse to the right"" ""more"" ""one more word"" ""Hit F1"" ""ctrl N"" , etc. for about 30 minutes. And this is the best help and mentorship I've received so far! HAHA

&#x200B;

I'm just flabbergasted as I reflect on what's happened actually haha. This is a company that I've read so many things about, such as on Quora, Medium, etc. and pays some of the highest salaries that exist for software engineering, as well as builds all sorts of cool stuff. I'm just really not sure what's going on. It's 7 months in now, and I feel like I don't know any of the people on my team, what they really do, what my manager wants me to do (I drafted up a document, but the yearly goals change nearly every time we meet, which is sometimes twice per week, and the weekly goals change constantly). I could solve it by driving it. But I don't understand the ecosystem enough to drive well. So I am sort of trying to make up things to do and shoot in the general direction, but it's sure slow going, as well as super annoying when what I did one week is not what I should have done and am somewhat reprimanded and put on the spot for it in the next week's meeting.

But here's the catch 22 - in order to switch teams, I have to deliver and perform. Any advice for improving? I'm definitely improving and slowly figuring things out, but by god would a little help from my teammates would be nice. When I onboarded two people on my last team remotely, I was one hell of a mentor compared to this. I would pair program and trade who's driving for about four hours a day for two weeks. And I got the time back right away because they were productive and doing great work on the projects I hired them for. I just don't understand what's so hard to get about that but whatever, I just need some advice to get past this and make the best of a bad situation.

I'm also not sure how healthy it is to rant like this. I have a nagging feeling I should ignore it and focus on the positive as much as possible. I'm not used to having so many things to complain about, so many expectations not being met in other words. It's a high paying job, and I'm sure once I'm over the onboarding and ""in"" with the team it would be much better. I have many friends on other teams here, and I know they would never do this crazy stuff I'm experiencing. The only explanation is that I landed in an extremely cliquey group that is not the norm here. Although if it's an ""in"" thing, I don't care to give the same experience to the next new guy or stay on the team.

EDIT: After thinking about this more, I am wondering if it's an everyone is enjoying the wfh life, working 4 productive hours per day with relationships they already have built up instead of 8 (or more), and just enjoying life more than working and grinding at the moment. And Mr. happy to jump in and work and debug and see what people are working on is ruining that for them. They can't explicitly come out and say that because I don't know, but maybe that's it. They are sort of playing the ""be busy and hope he bothers someone else game"". Just a thought. I'm not sure. I guess I have to figure out what video games these guys and gals play, or whatever it is they do and join the circle that way. From small talk before meetings, seems like everyone works all the time including weekends, but judging by how formal everything is and how unresponsive people are, pretty sure it's just optics for the big boss. I have met a few people on distant teams through the surf group and have gone out surfing, great people and exactly the type of nerdy extrovert ""build it all"" type people I would expect to run into here, so these two teams I'm onboarding with just really have thrown me a curveball.

**TL;DR:** Remote onboarding @#$%ing sucks, at least on this team, and no one is helping me help them, which I don't get. When I was the team lead on my previous team during the pandemic, I'd pair program, encourage people to informally chat and do team building exercises, and I got a return on my investment very quickly. Hit me with any advice on ways I can recover the situation into a more win-win, thank you.

Edit: After since hearing so many stories of this exact same thing here, I'm very convinced I'm not alone and won't be identifiable by saying the company is Google."

"In my experience it's not different to, and in fact easier than, achieving this in a non-remote work environment. Just knuckle down and get shit done and you will be seen, because too many people think that remote work is a good excuse for a paid holiday. Ask questions, make suggestions for changes which result in improvements, and where possible take charge of situations. It helps if you love what you do and believe in the company that you're working for."
"Uh, not helpful. Nice sentiment, not actionable.

Give me specifics. How does someone do that, in the context of telecommuting?"
"This is way more about the company you work for and how open they are to remote work, rather than how willing you as a person are to do it. Companies that value and trust their employees won't spy on them.

Remote work is a micromanager's worst nightmare, however. They hate the loss of control and can't wait to force people back into offices."
"Are you offering a service or a product? My understanding is (if you are independent contractor [W-9/1099]) you should only have to worry about the laws where you live. (State, county, and city. County is most likely to end up not-applicable. Be warned that there are extra federal taxes for independent contractors.)

I'm less familiar how telecommuting affects W-2/W-4."
"Seconded on the income tax being applicable just from your home state. Things should be pretty simple for you as an employee. The part that becomes a pain is really on the employer - with employees in different states, you have to deal with all of the different nuances of payroll withholding by state. Good overview here - https://www.sba.gov/blogs/payroll-concerns-remote-employees

I'm not sure how workplace law translates to the remote work situation. I think where-ever your HQ is is what laws are applicable but..definitely not 100% sure on that one. Can you think of an examples that might be different in Virginia compared to Florida, OP?"
I highly recommend Rat Race Rebellion. Give them a try. They have daily job listings and a huge list of companies to do telecommuting.
"For remote work you need to market your experience and skills, so that potential employers can easily see your ability to produce good results.

For me that means creating and maintaining open source projects on Github, and having a history of successful and visible apps and websites that I've built. Basically my digital portfolio. 

Build things, complete them, make sure they are high quality and look good. The more quality portfolio you have, the more confidence potential employers will have that you can be trusted to do the job."
"I second the comments below that a good way to start as a remote worker is to build out and incredibly solid portfolio and Github account. From the eyes of the person recruiting they just want to constantly be reassured that you are the right person to deliver the work that they need so to be able to actively demonstrate the exact skills a role is looking for is very important. 

Being able to offer a spread of skills is also very important. It looks to me like your skillset is focused mainly on backend web development at the moment and I think that being able to say you have some experience with something like ReactJS on the frontend would be a big selling point to separate you from other applicants. 

I run a website called [JustRemote.co](https://JustRemote.co) which promotes remote working positions. One thing I have noticed is that the majority of companies offering remote work at the moment are start-up's and small businesses. These companies often have fewer than 20 employees and as a result are looking for people who can offer a range of skills and are able to switch roles. Effectively the more skills you can offer companies like these the more chance you have of securing a role. 

In summary I would therefore do the following: 

1. Create a strong portfolio of well written code
2. If you can, try to display your portfolio in a visually appealing way (if you're design skills aren't great then something like [squarespace.com](https://squarespace.com) might be able to help).
3. Continue to develop your skillset with the aim of eventually becoming a full stack developer as then you'll be offering most value. 
4. Ensure your applications are well written, clear and considered.
5. Try to build a network of connections with other people in development. Referrals from an actual person are incredibly powerful and so attending start up events, dev meet ups etc can be very useful. 

I think it's especially hard when you're coming fresh from University as you have less work to back you up but don't give up! It's a numbers game and you will only need a single position to establish yourself as a remote worker in the eyes of future employees. 

Another option if remote work doesn't seem to work would be to try and work for a company like [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/en-uk/). I'm not sure where in India you're from but i've worked with many Indian developers in the UK all of which came over as consultants through Cognizant. This experience would help give strong credibility to your applications and it also allows you to build up a network of people who in the future may be able to offer you work. "
"I don't mind relocating to anywhere because there are no simply no jobs where I live. Also I have few of my batch mates doing remote work being a fresher since past few months so yeah they had an office job but they are working on totally different technology and did totally different things. So I'm hopeful to get remote work as well. 

So I'm not denying the fact to get an office job, my parents are also forcing me to do that so I'm already given 40+ interviews till now"
"One of the big advantages of jobs in the tech industry is the opportunity to work remotely from a home office. I've been working 100% remote for the last three years. There are some definite advantages, but one of the possible disadvantages is isolation. However there are a few things you can do to mitigate this:

1.) Stay in contact with your colleagues as much as possible, via instant message, video meetings, email and phone. Don't be reluctant to bounce ideas / bond socially over these mediums. Everyone else on your team needs this interaction and you'll find the bond can become greater between you and your colleagues as a result of these efforts.

2.) Get out of the house as much as possible. You can become isolated working alone if you don't take the necessary steps to get out and do activities you enjoy outside of your home office / workplace. Do the necessary things you need to with the important people in your life. Also, go work in a coffee shop one day a week - you'll have the ""buzz"" of a good coffee and people around you. 

3.) Whenever possible, set your own schedule and stick to it. Since you work at home, the lines between work and home can become blurred. Set the proper expectations with your boss, co-workers and clients. As long as you get your stuff done that's all that matters. That's part of the flexibility of being a remote worker. 

I say embrace it. It's cool your employer allows its workers to be remote, especially in the tech sector. Obviously they've put their trust in you to work from home and make the most of it!  

Good luck!"
"So you do have a handful of hobbies, which is a good thing. My experience is that it's a great way to really connect with people (especially martial arts!). I currently do martial arts and those are pretty much the people I socialize with. It's my 'fix' for social interaction for sure. I've met a lot of great people there. I train in the morning, then go about my day working remotely. I can really tell the difference in my attitude when I train in the morning with them vs. a day that I don't.

Can you opt to work remotely a portion of the week?"
"Good point. Some remote workers just want to be left alone to work, whereas others feel ignored if no one from the office ever contacts them or cares about them. How should a manager overcome this problem? Would love to hear thoughts. "
"Establish a routine for yourself.  When I work from home I have a special chair I sit in, I switch the lighting to look different; when my workday ends, I turn my work computer all the way off, I switch the lighting, I light some incense, and I move to a different part of the house.  (If the weather's nice, I also go for a run.)  This all helps keep the ""I'm working"" mindset apart from the ""I'm not working"" mindset.

Screenshare constantly.  You're a developer?  Does your team do pair programming?  Offer to pair with people whenever possible."
"These are all good comments.  I've been remote for 13 years and it comes down to discipline, communication, and desire.

You're working from home, not at home while you work. 8-5, 9-6, whatever your hours are are your work hours.  Don't fold laundry, catch up on your favorite shows, sneak in a nap or anything else you'd do on a day off.  No one can see what you're doing so you will be judged on your output/results, and if you're sluffing off the workday it'll show.  I'm not saying you have to be chained to your desk all day and avoid doing things like checking Reddit (lol), but the bulk of your workday needs to be spent there.

As the others said, work extra hard at communicating so you're still heard.  Schedule regular 1:1s with teammates and your boss, participate in team calls, and touch base during the day with relevant IMs.  

For me, though, the most overlooked factor is managerial support.  You can have the best plan, work your hardest, and deliver quality & timely results, but if the boss or the organization doesn't fully support you being remote then nothing else matters.  Some managers just don't know how to manage employees they can't see, and some aren't willing to learn.  Thankfully this doesn't sound like your case.  Those teams who are committed to telecommuting are the ones who make it work best."
"Find a good co-work space that'll get you out of the house and into a quiet office with friendly ""co-workers"" and reliable internet.  Don't rely of coffee shops or take calls from loud places that'll lead your co-workers to believe you're not working.  Be online, be available, and keep yourself connected.

I did the same thing for years working remotely out of San Francisco's for companies in other states.  Try DoorHaus on Mission Street.  It's pretty bare bones but affordable and good people.

I absolutely loved teleworking, I used all the time I saved not commuting to get in shape, learn to cook and pursue my personal interests a lot more.  Enjoy!"
"thanks for the input lp32. indeed ""well paid"" is a relative expression. what we mean to say with that is that these jobs pay more than people might know from remote work platforms like upwork.com or freelance.com which pay from 5USD an hour. compared to that one could say these are well paid, remote only jobs. "
"Once you telecommute you never go back! I've been both a contractor and employee long term. You can find ether type of job if you know where to look.

"I am actually junior-mid level. I'm interested in the full LAMP stack software development and I have used your site, skipthedrive! I've been applying for about 3+ weeks now with little dice. I get responses here and there but not that much momentum. With my job history, I would've gotten an offer with an onsite by now but I really love working remotely. I don't know what else I should be doing. Be patient perhaps? "
"I hear you...it's tough to go back to working in the office once you've gotten a taste for working remotely :)

Cool, let me know if you have any questions about SkipTheDrive!

Have you followed up with any of the applications? Is there anybody you can speak with on the phone? I'd recommend trying to get a bit proactive with regards to the communication if possible. Let's face it, in a 'virtual world', it's really hard to get people's attention. If you can somehow get a hold of the hiring manager via phone, that's a huge step. If not, I'd see if maybe you can ping them on LinkedIn. I realize that not all job listings will provide info on the hiring manager (for obvious reasons), but it's just something to keep in mind."

The first I didn't hear back after the ""HR interview"" and the second I just accepted an offer.  6 months after I started, I finally landed a new job and it seems to be an absolutely amazing fit for both of us.

It did help that I had been working remotely (by chance) for about a year - but I don't think it would have been a deal-breaker if I hadn't.

Just keep in mind that all it takes is one place."
"I'm not so much worried about the stack as much as what qualities employers are looking for. It seems like the main concern with hiring remote is the productivity (aka not slacking off). Besides telling them ""Yes I will work hard and produce results as a remote worker"", what else are you supposed to do when interviewing, sending out resumes, writing out cover letters, etc? Did you do anything that stood out that you think landed you the job?"
"> Yes I will work hard and produce results as a remote worker

I say, ""I've never had a problem keeping myself motivated and on task - I don't see why it would be any different in this position"".

Also, if you have partial experience lay this one out: ""I have also worked remotely (from time to time) in my current position, besides adjusting my routine I've never found it to be an issue when I work from home.  In fact, I actually find that I can be more productive when I'm working from home since I don't have to deal with the usual office distractions""  (you have to be careful not to sound ""crazy"" or ""overzealous"" on this part - that will totally kill it).

I've also found that something like this is a really good line:

""I've found that working remotely really isn't much different than working in a company with multiple offices (i.e. geographically seperated offices).  As long as you have communication tools like phones, IM, and conference lines - working remotely is really no different than working with people in a different offices""

I find that this one is a really good sell.  Few people can personally relate to working remotely - but nearly everyone can relate to working with people in another office.  In mind opinion, it really puts things into perspective.  Sure, there are some problems that arise from working with people in other offices - but for the most part, it's really not a big deal and most people can relate to it not being a big deal.
"
"You'll have to be the change you want to see in the company culture when it comes to remote work. If you know they respond better to on site workers, probably meet them half way. Have a stronger office presence, and while there in the office, start working more directly with your pm to have processes that benefit remote workers. 

If you don't want to put that effort in, then I recommend looking for a company that is a better fit. It will not change on its own, and is likely to take a good amount of work on your part to adjust the mentality. 

Good luck. :)"
"The biggest thing that comes to mind for me is when a manager is more focused on whether an employee is getting the job done rather than warming a seat at the computer in a strict 9-5 sense. I dont need to have ultimate flexibility in defining my own hours, but remote work should be more goal focused rather than on-call. In a similar spirit to being salaried compared to hourly. 

Aside from that, a manager should strive to find the right tools that allow the team to have good communication without adding too much overhead in day to day usage. A lot of managers or project managers may disagree, but the job is still about programming rather than reporting in on things. I like to work at companies that have well defined workflows concerning how to document work done. Jira tickets? Daily meetings? Documentation that may or not be used in the future. There are so many tools out there that reporting progress can sometimes be annoyingly redundant. "
" Two things come to mind - first, I would want to make sure that I am always included in meetings and kept in the loop. Second, it would be important for me to know that my boss totally trusts me, as working remotely can sometimes cause uneasiness."
"Whenever I encounter a telecommuting/remote job website, the first things I check are:

- What percentage of a given job is telecommutable? Are there certain days of the week or times in a month (or quarter) where the employee will be expected to attend employer sites for meetings or mandatory 'stay in touch' events?

- What percentage of listed jobs can truly be done from anywhere? What percentage require the applicant to be in the same country? What percentage are *technically* telecommuting but require applicants be permanently based in the same city? Can I filter by single or multiple cities, states, or countries I could work from?

- What percentage of jobs are *non-IT* jobs? Even more specifically, what percentage are non-programming/developer jobs? Quite a few TC jobsites should really call themselves ""Remote jobs for programmers and not much else"".

- Finally, when jobs are displayed in a list, can readers see the job's time-flexibility? Is a given job expected to conform to, say, business hours on the American west coast? Or does it have a little flexibility but some hours are fixed? Or is it completely flexible, where the hours don't matter as long as the work gets done within an agreed timeframe? Basically, if I'm on the other side of the world from the employer's HQ, will I need to keep night-owl hours?"
"Congrats on the site.  I'll check it out.  
FYI - my wife uses these sites to find jobs (education and editing) that allow her to work from home.  They may have some features you'd want to emulate.  
http://www.flexjobs.com/  
http://www.wahm.com/  
http://www.bookjobs.com/  
EDIT:  Also, my number one complaint about job hunting is the lack of salary information.  I've been at the same company for 10 years (several internal transfers) because job sites don't post the salary range for a job.  Every few months I idly look around but never apply.  I'm not going to waste my free time applying for jobs and stressed about whether they like me only to find out that they pay less than I currently make.  
BOE is bullshit.  They must know at least the minimum or max and a preferred target.  "
"Thinking about it, are you actively promoting telecommuting with companies which get in touch with you and their industrymates? These days, nearly any desk job can be done remotely, and that's space- and equipment-saving for employers, a commute-time-saving perk they can offer employees and applicants as incentive, and the advantages of physical distribution that include automatic disaster mitigation if anything disrupts the main offices.

Just wondering if any companies have come to you with, say, a programmer job which could be done remotely, and have walked away thinking about the cost savings of doing the same with HR, Admin, Marketing, Projects, and so on."
"This is the end-game we're aiming for, to be a real influencer and advocate for telecommuting, and to make telecommuting a normal work arrangement that doesn't raise eyebrows anymore. As we gain a larger audience (and hence influence), we'll start to work with employers on this!"
Indeed.com. with the location as work from home and the network information technology. There are lots there. 
"> What competencies did your manager have that positively impacted your overall job satisfaction?

My current manager lets me own my work. I rarely ever get bothered by him. He'll just ask if I saw a comment related to my work in a Slack channel occasionally. This is largely because he has his own work to do in addition to management.

My previous manager was more of a micro-manager and she went looking for work even when there really wasn't much to do. The problem was that she had two reports and nothing else to do.

> What competencies did you wish your manager had that they did not?

Nothing. He's fine.

> How did you feel about your work/life balance as a teleworker? How did it compare to more traditional jobs?

Much better work/life balance. I can help my wife out with watching the kids if she has an appointment, for example. I'm done at 5pm and see my kids the entire night whereas commuting left little time in the evenings for this. If I need to work late, the family is very comfortable with it because I'm still around to talk, etc.

An issue with office work for me was mandatory socializing and just the sense that you were visible all the time. At home, you can just focus on the work a lot more and save the socializing for family and friends.

> How did your manager impact your work/life balance?

Current manager is very positive. Like I stated, he leaves me alone for the most part.

> As a remote worker, how isolated did you feel from team members or professional peers?

I'd say I'm more out of the loop in terms of how the company is doing than I am with my peers. We communicate in meetings and chat, so we're not out of touch. I also have met nearly everyone face-to-face and some employees I worked with in-office for a year.

> How did your manager help you feel connected to the organization and its goals?

He really does nothing. I speak to peers for that info. This is true of office work, too, as managers tend to just push the executive spin.

> What guidelines or expectations did your company provide for communicating effectively?

Just that my work get done. That's about it.

> What did you do on a daily or weekly basis to ensure that you were being an effective communicator?

Just stay on top of issues as they arise in our issue-tracking software or on group-chat.

> Were your accomplishments visible to your manager, team, and company?

My manager sees my work and feedback on it, so my work is very visible to the team.

> What training did you receive in order to be an effective remote worker?

Nothing relating to remote work. I work in software and many employees work from home full-time or periodically. It's nothing complicated.

Hope that helps!"
"I am currently looking for a new remote job, and have been working remotely at least in part for 18 years. The struggle, even with a CV that is miles long of accomplishments that I have *while already remote* is not easy. 

Then someone posts ""Oh hey, I'm pregnant. Need a remote job tomorrow."" like the remote job fairy just gonna shower the remote jobs around."
I find it more amusing that people think remote work is just an opportunity to slack off when that is definitely not how it usually works.
"The comment section here is wild. ""Bust your ass for 20 years like I did then you can enjoy work life balance."" 

Not all people looking for WFH are lazy. They are looking to kill a commute or spend 10 minutes doing laundry instead of 10 minutes listening to a chatty coworker. WFH is not some sort of elitist club.

People with no experience expecting it to fall in their lap is not realistic at all, as originally OP and a few scattered comments are saying, but the rest of the comments just serve to support people suffering unnecessarily because they personally suffered before WFH."
"This whole sub is a dumpsterfire. I've got over 12 years experience in my industry, majority of that was on-site. I've had to work hard, upskill myself and focus hard on ensuring I'm at the top of my game to be a remote worker.

It's a shame there are no active mods as those of us that read the sub rules and play by them could really get some value out of connecting here."
"I'm so glad you made this post. I feel the same. I've been in IT for almost 15 years, have a Masters, and did all the grunt work for years. I make decent money for myself and support my family and I wfh 2 days a week."
"Read your last paragraph and then realize people aren't going to have tha luxury of working their way up in an office.

Jobs need to be accessible in order for people to get them.

We've also had decades of very real wage stagnation.

It really shouldn't be surprising that people will want jobs that pay a livable wage and if workers are expected to work remotely then companies need to adjust. 

Also many times remote work is a sign that their local businesses aren't hiring, despite what government wants to believe landing a decent job is difficult even in places where ""everyones"" hiring.

These problems are only going to get worse overtime in a global work force and with billions of people exerting pressure on remote jobs."
"I work from home full time and it's hard enough to do it with one dog and a cat.  I can't even imagine trying to wfh with toddlers/ babies in the home.  I mean, for real, either the job is going to suffer or the kid is unless you have childcare or help.  It's not for everyone.  I worked hard to develop my skills to be marketable enough to be able to transition to remote.  It did not happen over night. "
"Unqualified people think ""remote work"" is a job description in itself. 

No! It's a feature of a real job with a real job description with real responsibilities and requirements."
"You don't need to be pissed off that other people would want that, as well.  It seems like there should be way more WFH opportunities in 2024 than there are. Being offended that someone wants something just because it took you a long time to achieve it is petty."
"What I hate is when I mention I WFH people ask me what I do. I explain it at a very high level because very few people understand what I do. I have a masters, 20 years experience - 10 years WFH - I've taken every training ever offered and they say ""I could do that can you get me a job?""  No, Angela, you could not do my job. Your GED is not equal to my education and experience. I will not get you a job. 

There is nothing wrong with a GED. But it's not the same as my 6+ years education and training."
"I get the frustration over the repetitive posts but at the same time remote working isn't some kind of reward for bootstrapping it. It's just a location where your job occurs. 

You don't need to ""earn"" working remotely, you just need to find and get hired for a remote position. Easier said than done of course, but not impossible."
"I think your recap is what is commonly thought of wfh.  Everyone that wfh really doesn't work. They just watch the kids, do laundry, no skills, and still get paid.  They only see the outside view and none of cons or sacrifices made with wfh."
"I am one of many dealing with this shitty job market and seeing lots of posts on LinkedIn from folks expressing desperation - but noting a hard mandate for being remote. I feel bad of course, but, that hard mandate isn't gonna work. I am close to desperate, and while I would LOVE to be remote, not gonna happen. I gotta be ready to go in-office 5 days a week. The ""fun"" of WFH in 2020/2021 is not gonna happen again."
"I'm all for people trying to get remote work! I will always take the side of the worker.

What does kind of bother me is some of the tone deafness from people about my industry. 

I remotely work in tech and get messages from friends relatively often like ""how do I break into tech like you did?"" Like yo. There's been mass layoffs in my industry and I'm very nervous that I might at some point be one of them. Could you not ask me right now?

I just have to remind myself that there are a lot of people feeling the weight of late stage capitalism right now and are looking for anything to make it easier"
"Despite having a job where remote work is actually more efficient, it took Covid-19 for us to all get 100% remote. Before, they oh, so graciously, allotted us one day a week to work from home. Then, once Covid was ""over,"" they went back to 2 days a week in the office, because the older management had spent a whole bunch of money building a new office space for us...

I'm blessed to have chosen my career path, and I will likely be able to work remotely the remainder of my career, but it took 8 years and a pandemic to get it."
Just the number of people who think remote work is a solution to not wanting to pay for childcare for young children alone is frustrating!
"I supervise a team of remote workers. The demand for remote work is so high that I regularly hire people who are overqualified for the position. All these posts seeking quick, easy, remote work are delusional. If I can hire a top tier candidate, I'm not hiring someone with no experience looking for an easy gig they think they can do while sitting in bed all day."
"""because my toddler and infant will be home with me while I work, so I need to work around their naps and drive my other child to and from school.""

This is the most annoying part, you see post on here all the time ""What do you do in your down time"" and the same people who cry when a company wants to stop remote work are the same people telling you how they go shopping for 3 hours in the middle of the work day."
"What's more jarring is your insinuation that what was hard for you should be hard for everyone else. It shouldn't be difficult to find a job that accommodates your schedule or daily life whether that be remotely or in office. People have been led to believe that remote work is an escape from the traditional office space. Can you blame them for asking?  The fact is companies want your time, your energy and your SOUL. They don't care about your personal obligations. All of them want experience. Entry level with the requirements of a bachelor's degree while paying 14 dollars. I think you're irritation is misguided at the people who are trying to make it the same way as you when it should be at the companies making it nearly impossible to make money and have a life at same time."
"Very specific jobs are conducive to remote work.  Any corporate type job... Software, analyst, marketing, help desk, IT, call center.

I'm a waitress looking for a remote job.. Get bent!"
Speak for yourself. I do remote work. I advertise on Craigslist and people KNOCK ON MY DOOR to put their remotes up my crevices. Checkmate.
"I changed up my whole career and pivoted my continuing education to get an easier and more flexible job. I wasn't even looking for remote, just a break from a toxic industry, and I happened to luck into an offer with WFH flexibility that became permanent WFH.

Eventually, I tried to retire from the same job, and now they're paying me as a contractor just to coach my successor and draw pretty pictures once in a while.

I can see why this is a goal for so many people but I have no idea why some people think they're going to be able to take care of a toddler or infant during the day."
"What gets me is the mindset, ""I *need* to work form home.""

It's probably true. Work from home should be way more common than it is. It's good for employees and employers.

The problem is that the modern workplace doesn't give a shit about what you need. Employers want to take everything and give nothing. You think the people who don't want you to have sick leave care whether WFH will make your personal life easier?"
"AMEN.   


And then the people who think remote work means constant vacation where they can hop state to state and travel anywhere they want...until HR finds out, they get fired, and more people start losing the privilege."
"My wife has got a decent paying part-time WFH job but it's very difficult to set boundaries when everyone you work with is full-time, doesn't have kids, etc. 

She can't really work ""whenever"". Meetings pop-up during school drop-off/pickup. Tasks get assigned at 5PM due the next day by 10AM. 

We're thankful for the part-time aspects of the job, but the remote work aspects don't grant a ton more flexibility. 

In my opinion, the best ""WFH"" job for parents with kids is to run your own in-home daycare until you kids are in school. Our previous babysitter earned maybe $40k-$60k a year doing that. It's not for everyone, but it's probably the most in-demand WFH job there is."
"It makes me so mad lol cause what do you think? Remote work isn't an popular option that's regularly available for most companies. Makes them easier not to help, because a lack-of-initiative isn't going to keep you at a job. Why would you expect random strangers to help you find one of the most precious diamonds in adulting!!!"
I work from home... took a three hour nap but still got my work for the day done
"My WFH kinda came across my lap randomly. Very similar to call center work. I work as a crisis specialist for a suicide hotline. We don't have many employees so no need for office space. State sponsored. Decent pay. Four 10-hour shifts. The perfect setup in terms of accommodations, but the work itself is very challenging and not something I'd recommend for the average person."
"Yes.  I haven't had an office for over 10 years. I'm in account management now, but sold software in the past. Im accustomed to being the field rep in my area (Northeast).  Currently my company is somewhat local, but my last two companies were HQ in Texas and California respectively. Most people who do what I do are ""remote"" by nature. 

Some people continue to think ""working remotely"" means you don't really have to work all that hard. It a job, like any job.  You need quality skills and experience to land a good one.  You have the same responsibilities whether you perform the duties of your roll in the office, at home etc."
"Lol as someone who's had WFH jobs my whole life, and as an employer now of people with WFH jobs (yes good salary and benefits) I can 1009% say most people cannot handle WFH. They can't manage their time and they just cannot get work done outside a normal office setting. So while they may want it and think they can handle it, chances are they can't. Hence they can't find a WFH job. We can tell from the interviews they can't handle it."
"I see so many ""I want a high-paying, easy job... work from home... lots of benefits... no experience or education..."" it's beyond hilarious. These jobs do not exist. You want good pay? You either go to school, or start at the bottom and work your way up after some time. Good jobs require good people. They don't just fall out of the sky."
"No, I don't find it that way at all.

I'm sorry you guys had to suffer, but ffs it's okay if somebody doesn't suffer. If there were companies springing up that just offered everyone and their mom WFH, you'd probably just be bitter that they didn't walk uphill both ways in the snow.

It depends on the industry how easy finding WFH is. It's not about ""paying dues"" or ""suffering"" or whatever. It's about how easy it is for your bosses to imagine *anyone* doing that job remote. Hell, for my latest electrical engineering position, I got recruited by a huge company and they just *assume* everyone wants hybrid. You come in when you have to touch equipment, you stay home if you're doing design work on the computer. So yeah, WFH knocked on my front door.

Get in the right field and WFH comes to you. Software is the biggest one."
"The parts that absolutely grind my gears are the repetitive questions, commonly stated lack of skills suitable for remote work, and the assumption that we're all gallivanting about instead of getting work done. 

I have to *make* myself get up and take a break, lest I fuse into a potatoey lump with the chair. Laundry is great for this. Get up, walk 20 feet into the laundry room, move laundry from washer to dryer, or from dryer to basket. Not really any different than wasting 5 minutes in the break room getting coffee.

I also dislike hearing children in meetings. When in the background, that's one thing. When it sounds like the kid is the one on the call, that's a hugely disruptive issue. No, the call can not be extended, I've got six more back to back meetings today. Shut that kid up, and let's get back to work.

The company I worked for in 2020 had a policy. They were hardasses about it back then. Only 2 remote days allowed per month, and if you were in a conference call and a child was heard, your PTO was automatically docked a vacation day, because they assumed you were taking care of children and not doing your paid job."
"It's funny cuz my job title has 'remote' in it. So people keep applying. Even though it says Remote work: none. I work for a contract for the government. Like it would be breaking the law if my job was remote. I wish it was remote. It'd be the opposite of my job. 

Also, on this thread to get some ideas of different job fields I could transfer into"
"Exactly!!! Put some work into it, I have X Y Z experience and looking for remote. The current job I have is in project management and I pitched the work from home and got it. 

If your asking your lazy, or don't have the experience. Might get lucky doing sales or low end customer service. 

But you have to work for it and negotiate or know people. It's not going to fall in your lap every one and their mother wants to work from home now "
You sound like a boomer who is mad that someone could possibly get something for not going about it the same exact way YOU went about it. I personally know a couple of mothers that DO in fact work from home with NO prior training. Just because some people are clueless doesn't mean remote work is exclusive to only competent people. There is such a thing called company training.
"WFH is like the modern corner office. You need to earn it. 

I used to think it was for everyone, but some people just can't be trusted with it."
"I know someone who wants a wfh job to drop daycare. I'm like yes you will be able to work full
Time at home with kids running around"
Try learning a skill such as Medical Billing....I imagine there is plenty of remote work for that.
"I think some people get disillusioned by how easy it might be for them specifically, I got lucky and worked my way into a few different niches that are in demand and needed around the country by companies that don't want to spend the booku dollars to relocate me.   


Ngl I've caught myself recommending remote work to friends without thinking about it and they respond with ""work remotely doing what"" and then I realize ah shit, not all careers translate as easily into remote work"
Ugh so true. And that it solves all problems not so much I was not good at wfh.  I was fine getting things done but my mental health suffered
"They are gone.

I have never asked about the option of remote work.

Employer: Do you have any issues about coming into the office?

Me: No

Employer: We are in office 2 days a week.

Me: OK..."
I've been WFH for 10 years and I still don't have health....I work for an insurance company
"I think its less of an urgency and more of an envious feeling. I work in post production and have been WFH since 2021. Its amazing and i cant even imagine going to an office everyday. 

But i went to college, did tons of networking and building not only my reputation but my skills as well. Theres more wfh jobs than call centers and data entries. You can freelance in any art field from your house, social media or digital marketing, and tech/web based work. 

If you want to work from home pick an industry that can allow that and hone your skills so that you can either find a company that can contract you or hire you from home or you can freelance. Theres plenty of opportunities but you have to work for it."
"I got extremely lucky with a job, while being in person, has extreme flexibility in WFH. If I don't feel good, need to watch my kid because daycare is out, have an appointment, I can just stay home and make up the hours of an appointment or something runs late. It's not consistent and I can't always do it, but I am happy with the medium for the time being."
"I think the people that say it's easy come from a field of work that was regularly in office and moved to remote work during g the pandemic. Since then, remote or hybrid is the new norm. Most companies that required people to come back to office were extremely dissatisfied and switched jobs. When you're already in a job that was remote or had remote capability, it is pretty easy to land another remote job. However, like you said, if you don't have the experience in these types of roles, it will definitely be more challenging"
"Agreed. I mean, it doesn't offend me, but it is an unwise way of looking at career prospects. And the lack of industry specification or understanding that WFH in one industry is going to be super different from WFH in another, so you must plan accordingly. For example, the way to get into and grow within my own industry is very specific and the qualifications are very unique and don't really transfer. I didn't fall backwards into the job I have, which is, imho, pretty expectable and typical for most people who WFH."
"I am willing to take a remote job that doesn't pay well or have insurance and I've been trying to revamp my skills so they are more suitable to remote work (did a boot camp for data science, learned python, SQL, R - mid at best in all 3, also well versed in excel). 

What I am finding more often than not is the remote job is either hybrid or fully in office and I'm struggling to find jobs that are in fact remote. For the ones I've found that are real and remote I'm not meeting the requirements for I guess, past 6 years in k12 teaching and a BA in anthropology aren't helping. 

Ps: worked in a call center once as a ""remote pharmaceutical rep - not remote in an office just not going to the doctors directly - had to call actual doctors during business hours and read them a script that included the black box warnings for a drug called vagifem... work wasn't the reason I quit, my psycho boss who did weird shit like lock my paycheck in her desk and leave early for the weekend)"
It's near impossible to find. Also all the remote postings are scams!!! Idk how people are legit getting wfh jobs unless they're very experienced software engineers and even then it's a hybrid position usually.
"I don't see the problem with people asking. If anything, the desire to be a remote worker is a desire to join the white collar workforce. It could lead to somebody getting the required education and work experience and landing one of those jobs. Jobs which are economically impactful. It's a net positive for society."
"Just because other people have had to do something the hard way doesn't mean others have to go through the same thing. Why should we have to struggle for a remote position? Why should we have to take less pay or benefits for a remote position? Remote work still provides labor, which we should be appropriately compensated for. Furthermore, remote work is often cheaper for the company. 


You can only get what you ask for. "
"Well, so many are international (English isn't the first language so they probably aren't communicating well) and others are bots it's kinda meh. The posts I hate are the ones whining only for remote then how they need a job. I hate remote work but the job/company is great so I'll stick around and adapt for a couple years due to other circumstances. Guess what happens though when I don't have a job and need one, I take it, which is pretty much how I wound up here.

Most don't list their resume for a reason as well and complaining about months without something meaning, it more of a them problem. Either way, things take effort than just clicking submit with a kinda catch-all resume."
"I think people glorify in their minds about remote jobs. It's still a job. There are still rules it's not just Yep I work from home and collect a great paycheck and have great benefits and I do what ever I want all day. I wfh, have since 2015, but I have to logged in from 7 am to 5pm. My productivity is tracked in a ticketing system. It's still a job my company is just global so 1 office would be impossible as we have 1 person in each time zone across the world to cover the work."
"It's wild, honestly. *Everyone* wants to work from home. I'm still waiting to hear from a job that had hundreds of other applicants. I have chronic mental and physical health problems and I started working from home in 2016. I found out that I'm able to keep jobs for longer if I'm able to work from home. But now *everyone* wants to work from home."
"It's frustrating having to work in the office for several years but it's true. No job description will ask for this ever but I am positive recruiters take into account years spent in office and remote work. I had to spin my in-office years of experience and then hybrid remote (COVID) to land my current 100% remote job I have now. 

Even when I have been applying to other remote roles the past 6 months, no one is biting. So imagine that I am in the fortunate position of being remote and employed (easier to get a job when you have one already) and still tough competition out there now a days."
"I worked as a telemarketer before becoming more of a tele-sales associate and then just went into full on sales. If you have a position that holds you accountable to your work such as setting X amount of appointments, closing X amount of sales, or making X amount of outbound calls, you are given more freedom because you have shown you have a valuable skill that can be utilized. I had 1 WFH job where I was waiting on inbound calls all day and it eventually closed because we werent getting enough calls in a day to justify sitting around. I went from chasing 3-5 busses a day, sitting in traffic, getting into accidents, to working from my home office. I really enjoy it, but again you have to be trustworthy, and show you can do the work without being micromanaged. I had one position that wanted me to clock out every time I went to the bathroom... that didnt fly for me. When your job is to make calls set appointments and make sales, it will translate into ""Hey we can trust this person and they are making money so let's let them do their thing."""
It's a result of scammers selling the dream of remote work via social media. Everyone thinks it's easy and that you don't have to actually work.
As others have mentioned too. Usually entry level remote work isn't the greatest. I'm in a remote A/R role and it sucks. Way more stressful job duties than my in person role but the benefits of wfh keep me in so far..
Wfh people always complaining
"I'm split.

On the one hand, I really can't stand the ""Need remote job ASAP""-style posts. They're showing a lack of desire to do any sort of searching or planning to find remote work and likely need career guidance if they can't figure out how to type ""\[industry\] remote jobs"" into a search engine. Genuinely, a lot of remote work involves having to be able to work at least semi-independently and having initiative. It's not a good look if you can't even try, or if you have tried, you can't even tell people what you've tried or what you're looking for.

On the other hand, there is no such thing as a ""common"" remote path. My path started out with freelance and consulting, but then I was able to leverage skills both in-office and remote to get into more stable work. I didn't have 20 years of in-office work, nor do I have a PhD. I think that there's a desire to puff our chests out about how hard it is to get a remote job, but honestly it's been way, way easier for me to find remote work. It leverages different skills."
"Can you provide good experience/skills for good wfh jobs? I figured customer service was a good remote skill which waitressing would have so I'm wondering what more there would be to provide? From someone with no degree (or kids), but would be willing to work towards a better position."
"I've been remote, hybrid, and in the office.  I like the flexibility of hybrid, but choose to go into the office.  I've always been unsure of remote workers, seems easy to can them."
It's pretty crazy. Don't even get me started on Boomers opinions on work from home. I got incredibly lucky with my remote job now. I got my first remote job by literally emailing the CEO asking to push my application in
"Call center was my first WFH job. I was thrilled to finally have what I thought would be the freedom and flexibility of working from home. It actually ended up being more restrictive than much being in-person due to being literally tied to a phone and having all of my breaks away from the phone scheduled and timed. I felt like a prisoner in my own home, and that doesn't even get started on having to deal with angry and weird customers. It was so bad that I didn't last 6 months and actually went back to brick and mortar retail, which I also hated. 

Now I have a WFH job that's more aligned with how I envisioned it. I do my work and take breaks as needed without being micromanaged."
Typically I see ones where they save they've got no experience and want a wfh job that's not a call center job.
"Tons of people aren't cut off for call center work even if it's remote. You see a lot of turnover, even though again, it's remote work. It's not difficult work, however it can be a very stressful environment for some."
That's the real issue I have. I earned my remote position by many years of managing my time and delivering the goods as required in an office position first...then Covid separated those who actually could manage wfh and those that thought they could. Now it's a privilege to have a remote position. These people think that it's a free ride...lol. Little do they know how pressurised it actually is.
I agree. I saw one post like that on local FB mom pafe every few days. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but WFH jobs nowadays will require lots of experience. I'm on my industry for almost 10 years. Graduated college and have few designation. Finding a wfh job could be challenging sometimes.
"This is my experience as well. Im in a women group and we're all immigrants. I kept seeing posts looking for WFH position but they have no degree, no experience, they said their English isnt good but they want the job to pay well.  but if i try to be honest and ask them what qualifications they have or the reality of it,  they said im mean and toxic lol like WFH is this magic buzzword floating around but they have no idea what it means. They just think they dont have to spend money on daycare and get to be home with their kids while doing nothing. Every day someone will ask if they should study nursing, data analytics or accounting because they heard it pay well but they never go to school in the US. Some even want $100k+ jobs with nothing under them and im like be forreal rn lol i feel for them and im there to help but they dont want to listen..."
"Yep. Going even partially remote/WFH is like scoring a manager/executive gig: you either need to have a lot of established positive experience or you better prepare to eat shit for a few years getting it before it's even an option for you.

Remote/WFH hires, in most cases, are gonna be hired by people who never meet you or even necessarily SEE you. You're a voice on a phone to them. And the workplace has no way to monitor your work habits and progress besides basic production tracking software.

So if you're looking for an entry level, no experience needed remote/WFH job, you're probably going to be limited to answering angry customer phone calls or transcribing spreadsheets. And I probably don't need to say this, but the pay for doing those things is not great.

And if you screw up or fall short once, expect to be let go because at entry level, you can be easily replaced."
"Exactly what I was thinking. Reminds me of the people that get mad that some ""easy"" jobs are getting paid more. I had a friend that would always bring up the cashiers at Costco making $20 an hour when it took her years of work and a degree to make $20 an hour. Okay.

A job's pay and degree requirements do not determine anything, nor does remote work determine anything. The truth is that someone somewhere is doing your exact job for half the pay and has twice the qualifications and someone somewhere is doing your exact job for twice the pay and half the qualifications. 

The only exception is jobs that require licensing."
"I'm one of the lucky ones then. 

Started as an entry level Data Analyst (coming from an office admin job and no college), then covid happened 6 months later and I've been WFH since then. My role's been transitioned to permanent telecommute and I'm a Sr DA now at 6 figures. "
"Yeah, this. It's not some kind of reward for slaving away. It's mostly being in the right field and being able to turn down jobs that won't give you remote work."
"You had a degree, the example given in the post was waitress, mechanic. Congrats on always being wfh!!"
"But you have education and experience.  And you likely have a title, which I'm sure isn't General WFH employee. Folks come on wanting WFH as if that's the job, not the location. It's frustrating that people don't realize that. I try to encourage where I can, but if your only experience is pushing carts at your local grocery store, that doesn't really translate into a skill that can be used in any WFH job."
With respect 8 years ago was pre Covid before wfh and remote jobs exploded to the lunacy it is today. I very much doubt a recent college grad would have the same experience when many can't find ANY job at all.
"Ain't it funny how 4 years ago, being wfh even two days a week was a rare treat we had to earn. Nowadays, people expect full wfh right out of the gate. "
"This happened to me, too. Was searching a few months and only opportunities were onsite. I wasn't going to switch jobs for a longer drive so held off. Suddenly, in October, I had multiple recruiters reach out for full time work from home. Not sure what happened but grateful for my new remote role."
"Agree. WFH isn't some elite status you have to work towards. Some companies do remote work and some don't. I work for a company that does remote work and there's plenty of people working right out of college or even while taking classes, people returning to the workforce after time away, people pivoting careers. Etc and then on the other side, plenty of people who have built a career for years. "
"My sister in law thinks my WFH job is easy, and she can do it too. It is because I do my work on a computer, so she thinks she will just need to sit, look at the screen, clap clap on keyboard, and get paid. Easy peasy."
"It's a bizarre fantasy--and self limiting, to use a medical analogy. The people living in that dream world (wanting a high-paying WFH job but with no skills or experience) are only wasting valuable time."
"I have experience in office work, record maintenance, billing ,data analysis and health care outreach. Almost every wfh job I could qualify for is a scam."
"I think you're missing the point of the original post. It's about people with no skills or qualifications who want someone to hand them a wfh job. Just because they woke up and decided it'd be nice to wfh - not because they're in a wfh conducive field, or because they've been searching for a wfh in their field and haven't been able to find one. Sorry, you don't go from being a hostess to landing a remote software engineering job."
"NO, read my post again . I'm judging people who expect to find a job with great pay and flexible hours that they can do remotely, when they have zero skills or experience to do anything conducive to remote work. And if that weren't enough, they expect a random stranger on Reddit to find this job for them - oh, and they will need to start working tomorrow because the rent is due. THAT'S who I'm judging."
"These comments lol. Remote work isn't some lavish lifestyle,  your ""hard work"" mindset isn't going to guarantee you a remote position. Remote positions are decided by the company (owners) and whether or not they want to adapt the remote lifestyle. You happend to work remote because the company you work for offered it. Not because you're a ""hard worker"". There are plenty of basic, minimum wage positions that offer remote work."
"i had this same experience with one of my wfh call center jobs. forced to be on webcam, share both of our screens, and they even tried refusing us bathroom breaks unless it was during one of our scheduled breaks. 

call center jobs tend to be absolutely soul sucking."
"Sounds like we had the same first WFH job, lol. I could have written the first 4 sentences myself, word for word. I lasted 3 months, and two months of that was training. I HATED that job. Once, I turned my head because I thought I heard a noise and I got a message on Teams asking me why someone was in the room I was working in (we were watched by people in the Philippines whose job was to monitor our every move while on camera). 

The job I have now, I landed by.....I don't even know. I wasn't searching for WFH. Didn't want to, actually. But, I do and I'm learning to love it."
">Answer as many calls as fast as you possibly can, if you don't adhere to our metrics then we'll discipline you and eventually fire you.


I worked in a call center for 4 years, and it really is the pace that makes it so unbearable. They literally want you working every single minute they are legally allowed to make you work. Humans just aren't designed for that pace of work--we need physical and mental breaks to recharge (and not just 15 minutes every 2 hours, my god). Slow days were okay-ish but then they'd start sending people home so there would be fewer breaks between calls.


I did emails at the same time I was taking calls, but our call system treated emails and calls the same so I'd time my email sends to put myself at the end of the call queue. I could sometimes buy up to 10-15 minutes between phone calls on slow days, and it became kind of a game to me which helped me get through my shifts.


I was lucky that only about 1 year of my time there was full time, the rest was part time while I was in college (they had a tuition benefit). I graduated into the great recession and jobs were excruciating to come by. I ended up taking a pay cut to leave the call center and go into public sector admin work.


Now I work from home as a project manager, but it's been a long time getting here."
"I used to do it and warn people that it's not really the WFH job that they think it is. For me, it was way more chaotic and restrictive than any in-person job I've ever had."
"Yeah, I got attacked on another sub by some Taco Bell team lead who wanted to work from home. I was trying to explain to her that 1. her experience as a team lead in a chain resteraunt doesn't really give her the skills that can translate to a high paying remote job and that 2. she won't be able to really care for her 2 yr old if she were able to snag a WFH job. She was so pissed she kept coming at me with different burner accounts (it was obviously her, as all her usernames ended in the same 4 numbers), she was actually trying to pretend to be an ""innocent bystander"" that just had to interject into our conversation because how rude I was. I'm like, bitch, if this is the level of professionalism you plan to bring to your WFH job, good luck. Trying to keep it real with people never works. Turns out she was a wannabe YouTuber with 6 followers."
"And so what? I'm curious why you care about this? If they are as worthless as you have already decided they are, then surely they won't get a shot at the type of job they want, right? So what does this matter to you? It almost seems like you have a problem with someone having the audacity to have something you have. 

I don't understand having the time or energy to give a shit that someone else wants to work from home."
"My dad is constantly falling for these WFH scams. He's disabled and living in Colombia so he needs a remote job. The jobs he finds from Facebook group are: 
1. Translate this book from English to Spanish and we'll pay you $2000USD.
2. Postage these real estate listings on FB Marketplace and handle the incoming messages. 

For the money, they direct him to a shady PayPal-like site where you have to pay for an employee ID so they can send you the money. In other instances, FB limits your Marketplace listings because you're posting obvious scams (that you don't understand because you're naive) and your handler offers to help fix the problem. You give them your username and password and never hear from them again. They hack your FB and other accounts. 

Luckily I've taught my dad that these are all scams and no one is going to pay him lots of money, for little work. Dude's just desperate."
It's ridiculous the company stopped the program instead of being reasonable and having someone explain to the woman her job duties could not be performed remotely. The fact it even needed to be explained to her demonstrates why she isn't even cut out for remote work in the first place even if her job duties COULD be done remotely.
"The reason people think you don't actually work at home is because so many people were posting online that they were slacking off at home and their bosses saw it. I mean if you are going to do so, don't bring attention to it. I think this gives all wfh a bad name and why everyone thinks being in the office is more productive. It's not. Some people are  more productive at home some at the office, but so many people were saying ""oh look at my $90k job working from home while not doing anything."" And companies were noticing."
"Those are the ones I don't apply for. I myself am not expecting completely remote work but I look for heavily hybrid positions because they are usually flexible with WFH. 

A lot of WFH jobs are those with skills, but I'd welcome WFH for new employees too. Simply because if I could save them from the hardships I had never having remote opportunities then I would."
"Yes! People hear/see work from home, and they picture puttering around the house, cooking, taking the dog for a walk, taking a nap. They don't see that I'm there more than I would be at a traditional job but I'm alone. Coworker, friends, and neighbors aren't stopping by. Lol I'm actually working just from a home office!"
"I agree. My partner and I are both WFH. He's a senior manager and makes more than me (we both make 6 figures), but he never went to college. We both fell into this same field very randomly. I went to college for a useless liberal arts degree and it has nothing to do with my job. But our field went remote during Covid and I am really grateful. The people that grumble about how they had to work so hard come off as very defensive that others also want what they want. It's giving true boomer, ""get off my lawn"" grouchiness and overall negativity.  

Many people would like to work from home. Many people have zero idea of what kinds of jobs might allow that because--shocker--most of us aren't well-versed in the detailed type of work structures in different fields."
Well work from home doesn't mean babysit while working.
"Then please explain why posters don't seem to apply this in their own lives. If they post here about wanting to wfh, but don't list what exactly they wish to do for work, how are they planning to accomplish that? What are they hoping to accomplish other than receiving someone's best guess of an ideal role? We don't know what you want to do for work, and almost every position will have some sort of requirement. The reason they post here is because they can't find the remote opportunity they're looking for. Why? Because they aren't the ideal candidate."
"U are making sweeping generalizations over ""slackers"" that u made up in ur head suddenly someone asking for advice about an entry level remote job that would allow them what, 30 min away from their computer to go grab their kids from school at 3pm makes them automatically not a hard worker and slacker? Or bc someone doesn't want to be verbally abused at a call center with little to no time between calls means they don't want to work? Or someone posting here for where would be a good place to look into working makes them a slacker? Whatttt someone tell these boomers using online forums to get real peoples advice in ur desired area of employment to guide ur search for employment is how to be RESOURCEFUL not a slacker. Luckily this is my WFH day so I can argue w miserable old hags on the internet, but u have not offended me. I am not offended bc I know ur anger comes from a place of jealousy insecurity and ultimately is bc u are threatened due to the competitive nature of remote jobs these days. However, the shift forward most ppl want to see is more remote jobs so that those who want to be home to prioritize their own health and ppl around them can do so and be paid a living wage. U ofc are offended at this, that ppl want better for themselves. Sad all around!"
"What...do...you mean?

It's not easy to find a great paying WFH job. If it were, almost everybody would be doing that right now. It SHOULDN'T be a requirement, but for most it will be"
"I think that that is the thing here- the YouTube channels that do wfh home searches and spinning some jobs as being achievable for people without certain experience or skills or help with children. It sets people up for disappointment . 
I sent messages to two YouTubers who were advertising a type of job from Pinterest, which required experience in SQL and/or R. They were actively downplaying this requirement,  and I told them that there's a reason why this is required,  and to speak to those viewers who have that type of data experience.  I was ignored,  because telling people with fast food experience that they can totally get a data science job gets views, I guess."
I personally am not offended that they want to work from home and I wish everyone had the choice - I do feel that some day in the distant future everyone will have the option. What I do get offended by is anyone thinking these jobs are a dime a dozen and that we do not actually work incredibly hard. I work all 40 of my hours a week if not more and it is incredibly frustrating to see people think they can just order up ANY job like it's a pizza let alone one that I have busted my ass to have access to. It's a level of entitlement that I cannot wrap my head around.
"I don't give a shit about anyone that wants to work from home....hence the reason why I won't waste two seconds of my life giving tips or suggestions to any of these lazy people who want the wfh jobs to show up at their front door. It's annoying to see every other post be some schmuck asking for help getting a wfh job with zero qualifications. If they can't even Google, are they qualified to work anywhere, let alone remotely?

But hey - I think you personally respond to each one of those posts with advice. In fact, I think you should let them list you as a reference. Or better yet, get them hired where you work so you can be coworkers."
"Nor would you, ever.

After all, the remote work fairy works remotely."
"I despise the idea that remote work is some specific field.

I don't know what Random Person's qualifications are, or skills, or even interests beyond staying home."
"My boomer coworker complains that remote workers don't do anything. All he does is yell at people on the phone and walk around bothering people. He took 2 hours to read me a manual like it's a picture book as if I can't read and haven't been in this industry for 3 years. After all that ""work"" he still leaves at 2. Yet these people say ""this office would fall apart without me!""."
"I'm a WFH systems engineer and I've been working in various escalating responsibility and infrastructure roles for 12 years now. I'll tell anyone that will listen that my hardest and most physically/mentally exhaustive job ever was being a sales associate at Walmart from ages 18-20 where I started at $8.10 and finished at $9.60/hr. I think everyone deserves a job as comfortable as mine, no one should be stuck in a career where they are treated the way I was at Walmart. I hope the future holds better working conditions for people that are stuck in these jobs. "
"Damn right Covid proved it, but it was a struggle even before Covid. A little story... After 15 years of working at offices, I finally broke into a career that allowed for hybrid. My circle thought WFH was a joke and that I was just using it to play video games and screw around during work hours. We had to fight the skeptics and prove to them that we can be just as productive, if not more, working from home. When Covid happened, these skeptics finally got a whiff of WFH, and they became believers.

Now that ""Covid is over"" and the powers-that-be want butts back in the offices, people are expecting remote jobs to be a given. The same skeptical circle sees their companies forcing them to RTO, and now they ask me for openings at my place of work. Well, you need to fight for WFH. Earn it. Strike those key relationships. Prove your reliability. That's what it took before Covid.

edit: I put ""Covid is over"" in quotes because my New Year's party was cancelled because a number of us (including me) got hit with Covid."
Because the harsh reality is that remote work isn't for everyone. Most people can't focus or micromanage themselves to be able to work efficiently when the bed is right next to them. I've met a dude that got a remote job and since then he's been sleeping constantly and waking up in the afternoon
"Ahh yes, I made a typo on my phone....you have proven your superiority which seems to be quite important. You have proven once again that you are superior to the lessers who are asking questions here. 

.So if these people are ignorant to the fact of the education/experience requirements.....maybe tell them? Or you could ignore it and move on. You could say ""I'm sorry but my specific job at my organization requires XYZ."" But the complaints here seem to be simply hating on people for having the audacity to show up here asking for info. 

A lot of people have no idea about a lot of things. Some are lazy morons and some are just regular joes looking for info. You can always be helpful and answer or you can choose not to engage. You don't know what you don't know. It's clear that some of you just feel you are better than anyone daring to ""expect a remote job to magically appear."" Again, who cares? 

Maybe the name of the sub should be remote work for those with years of education and experience? I find it laughable that such a self important group of people are so bothered by folks they deem beneath them."
"For starters, I'm not offended. In fact, quite the opposite. I'm proud of what I've accomplished with the hand I was dealt in life. I have worked hard to seize every opportunity I could and tried to get whatever I could out of each crappy job I had over the years. Second, It doesn't make any difference to me what you or anyone else thinks about me and my education and career. Clearly I'm in the minority here, as a lot of people commenting seem to be invested in what others have going on. 

As far as me being an outlier, maybe ten years ago, but not so much these days. Again, this is going to depend greatly on your line of work. I'm  obviously not going to be hired as a surgeon with a GED. And I would almost always be better off if I had that education along with everything else I bring to the table. But I have definitely seen a shift in the corporate world when it comes to people being give a a chance with much less education or experience than what used to be required. Again, I'm definitely not saying that experience and education are a waste or negative, I would love to have more of both. But I do think that those with a more alternative background have more of a chance now than the last 20 years. 

As far as people wanting better jobs or WFH jobs and thinking they can do what you do....so what? I truly mean no disrespect but I don't understand why you care. You basically all but come right out and say these people are too lazy and ignorant to realize the skill your job takes, so then why would you expect them to realize that they have no chance? 

For as long as I can remember there have always been people shitting on other people's jobs and saying how easy they were and that they could do the job no problem. I guarantee I've done this myself, I'm sure we all have. It just comes from a place of ignorance of the ins and outs of a job. 

So people show up wanting a WFH job with little to no experience and you don't like that. But there are hundreds of different jobs out there, many that you have no clue about and that have zero to do with your expertise. Maybe these people could do phone surveys or call center work. Maybe they could work in healthcare doing appointment scheduling or answering benefits questions for an insurance company. Perhaps the person kills it at sales....how do you have any idea what all is out there and what they might be good at?

It seems to me that if you are educated and highly skilled, you have nothing to worry about. So again, I'm not sure why you would be offended by someone looking for a job or feel the need to gate keep who is deemed worthy enough to work from home."
"Everything OP said is truth. WFH is not an ""opportunity"" to stay home with your kids and work around their schedule. It's this mindset that gets people sucked into remote scamming. 

The only difference in WFH vs in office, is WFH. You still need to sell your sell to the corporation and work your 8 hours. It's just like being in an office, just at home."
To be fair a lot of redditors (like me) see wfh people say they do all their work in like 3 hours and are done for the day so sometimes they pick up a second or third job since they can knock them all out in a few hours a day. So that might draw readers to assume a lot of wfh stuff is easy enough to get into.
"People need money to eat and have shelter.  People that are unable to attend a workplace do to kids, health, or other things just need to survive.  Calling them lazy is just rediculous considering they are actively looking for work.  Of course they want something that meets a bare minimum for a standard of living.  What audacity to ask to be able to work full time and afford to live.  Whats the point in getting a job if it oays so little it cant even cover your expenses.  When you say stupid shit like that just maybe think for a second about others acual reasons for acting the way they act without being a cynical piece of shit.  Even the last line paragraph shows you only care about how people can benefit you.  People just need to survive and if the job market around you is shit or you are confined to your home wfh is your one of the few options just to survive whether they have applicable skills or not."
"> why I won't waste two seconds of my life giving tips or suggestions to any of these lazy people who want the wfh jobs to show up at their front door

You'll certainly spend a bunch of time ranting and raving about them though"
"That's what my family thinks of my job too. I WFH but I travel so much for my job, that it balances out the WFH. but my family just thinks I go and party at all these places but I'm literally just stuck in a conference hall for 10-12 hours a day. And then when I do get done with the conference for the day, I usually have to catch up on emails I missed while being at the conference and do busy I'm unable to check emails. 

Like no, family, I'm not having the most relaxing time. I still have to work"
"It requires a different way of working and being effective that not everyone whose background is on-site work can transition to with success. 

There are posts in here, and in the WFH sub, where people who are new to working remotely are struggling with how to even communicate with coworkers. How to get to know colleagues, how to find who to ask questions to, how to access resources, how to get trained in company tech and tools. People who find it impossible to focus because there's no separation between work and all the chores and fun of home, people whose difficulty is actually defining work hours and sticking to them because ""work is always there"" when you're remote. 

Someone whose background is of delivering success remotely is already accustomed to it, and I wouldn't expect them to have as many difficulties. They also tend to have more realistic expectations of remote work still being work, and that while you're in your remote office you're in the office."
"It's a hardline benefit 

""Oh this position isn't remote? Have a nice day"" 

""Your recruiter contacted me, a remote worker to come into the office? Do you hear yourself? Hope the money has more cents than you do.""

You get the gist"
"Your right not always, but I am always available, and I'm 100% confident that the people in my department that do work from home are doing an amazing job.

Work from home isn't for me though but I have the option to do so if i want.  I just think a lot of people take advantage of it."
"YES!   With all the resources available to all of us, it's not hard to do your own research and sourcing/searching.  Most don't even search the SUB let alone anywhere else.   There are some people that want all the work done for them, and everything to be handed to them. Read, read, read. Research, research, research. Apply, apply apply. NO one can or will do it for you.

I almost feel like if you're not efficient enough to do the legwork and search, you may not be efficient enough to thrive in a Remote position or have the focus, discipline and professionalism that it takes to make it work.

Having a WFH or remote isn't an 'easy' day. You're still working and need to be professional. You're not cleaning your house, or running errands. Find child care.  Have a quiet place to work. It's WORK. It's a JOB. The only thing difference between working remote and in-office is location.

&#x200B;

Edit: Missing a word."
"There's nothing I HAVE to do. When I post on Reddit asking for career advice I'm not asking for a local HR rep, I'm asking for advice. U are conflating asking for advice with being spoon fed a job. And guess what - rich ppl get spoon fed jobs every day and u don't seem offended. Ur particularly only offended over ppl w no degrees or experience and who are asking advice as to how they can get a wfh job! If I am knowledgeable in something ppl ask on Reddit I'll probs answer bc it's goddamn Reddit and that's what online forums are for and that's why I'm here, to ask, to answer, to post. So if I had anything to offer I'd probably answer! If not I won't, if I don't feel like it, I won't! I won't be OFFENDED over them asking. Unlike U who is literally worked up and quite literally OFFENDED over ppl asking questions. How DARE they ask for advice on how to get a job that suits them and their lifestyle on this online forum in a thread dedicated to the jobs they would like to achieve. And guess what I do think ppl deserve what they think is best for them. Why not? If they want a remote job, they should have it. I want to get laid this weekend, I deserve to. Who are u to decide otherwise? That's my whole point! It's okay girl, it's Friday. Imma log off of work today and turn up bc it's pay day. That's what IM gonna do!!"
"*ridiculous

You can't search for a remote job or network with people you know? Yeah, you're lazy. 

You think you can get a job without experience or skills, simply because you ""want"" to work from home? Yeah, you're stupid.

You need to survive and need money to eat and have shelter? Take whatever job you can find instead of insisting on a remote job.

It's really that simple."
"about the same level of skill as using microsoft word. If working remotely is a highlighted skill on your resume then I can only imagine ""communicates effectively"" and ""proficient with microsoft word"" is too"
"I'm not ""coming for you,"" I'm attempting to have a conversation. I find folks use the whole ""I'm no longer going to engage"" thing as a cop out. 

I mentioned that people are often ignorant and think they can do a person's job, that I've felt that way myself. It is certainly annoying. The thing is most people have zero idea of your 20 years of struggle and education. But then again, there are jobs out there that ate highly paid, cushy gigs, that someone just sort of fell into. 

I think you misunderstand what I'm saying. Some people are lazy and stupid, we all know this. So when they come looking for info you can give it to them or choose not to engage. It seems that you take it as a personal attack. Something along the lines of ""How dare this moron think they could do my job."" 

But it seems to me that every person that posts here asking for info isn't specifically wanting your job, rather info on any wfh job. My issue is the negativity towards people who are asking questions. It sounds like you are doing well for yourself and have worked hard to get there, I have as well. People also assume that they can easily do my job too. I tell them what it entails and to go ahead and apply. If people ask me more generic questions about work from home gigs I mention some possibilities I know of and move on. Who am I to assume these people aren't worthy enough to gather info about wfh jobs?"
"Yeah I see it mostly in the r/overemployed sub than anywhere else, and it's not the norm though it seems to be catching on with more and more people getting busted for it at their j1 or j2 when they find out.

I think a lot of people especially younger ones see it as something that shouldn't be the exception to the rule but rather common for jobs that can accommodate it. Obviously some jobs just can't work that way or at least not yet. I know a lot of people only got to WFH by working hard, but I think it's also become more common to seek it out and expect it after COVID times made it more common and certainly brought it into the spotlight."
"You cant understand that some people dont have networking connections with people you already know?  Yah your braindead

You dont realize that some peoples only option is wfh because of extenuating circumstances whether they have the skills or not?  Yah, your stupid.

You dont understand that some places local work literally does not pay enough to pay rent so the option is homelessness or wfh.  Also people who are in that position generally dont have the fluid cash to move.

Please just empathize with other peoples situations for once in your life.  I know its easy to assume people suffering have to deserve it somehow but just try and understand other people perspective.  Ive never worked from home.  Ive been a cook, welder/fabricator, and went to school for mechanical engineering so I should be ripe to make fun of these ""lazy work from home"" people.  Instead just understand its just people trying have a decent standard of living."
"a lot of people are pretty stupid in general. If you cant communicate/work remotely then you probably suck in office too

do you actually have on your resume that youre an effective remote worker?"
Of course? But I'd say most of these jobs have significant down time. Either way id say on average people do about 4hrs of work a day in a remote work jobs. I don't understand the purpose of this.
"Congratulations , you probably have mad skillz, ""remote work"" doesn't count, imo "
My company allows me to work almost anywhere in the world as long as I give them a heads up ahead of time. But with all of monitors and stuff I prefer from my home office!
"I WFH. I wouldn't go to the office even if it were across the street, because it's noisy and distracting and, as a matter of fact, useless."
"The company I work for allows and encourages digital nomadism for employees to alleviate the cost of living burden.

I WFH, but I usually try to travel often and can work from anywhere. Thus, we usually travel to places outside of the US.

Some teammates are in a different country every couple weeks while others rotate between countries or areas within the same county/counties. 

Others have permanently relocated abroad."
"I work from my home office. I have a really nice setup and with carpal tunnel I couldn't work from the coffee shop or wherever on my laptop. Also if I'm traveling I'm on vacation.


I do have coworkers, including my manager, who will go to a city for a few weeks and work from there. Seems like they're in an Airbnb taking meetings from the a desk or couch.


My company is international with people all around the world, so we are allowed to work anywhere, although if it were more than half the year we'd probably have to declare where we live and may get paid differently."
"I work from home. My company wouldn't know or care, but for me, it looks like this:

* it's not worth paying for a coworking space
* I have a big monitor, and coffee shops are uncomfortable - so it's just better to stay home.
* And as far as travel goes... I've done the math and figured that to spend the money to go somewhere and rent a place, only to still have to work? Nah, not for me.

So that's how I figure it. I suspect for most remote workers, it's about the same."
"You always gotta love the ""perfect scenario"" posts about WFH.

Where are the ""Yeah I WFH, but I live in a home w/ a mortgage, spouse with Their Own Career, pets, and an eldery parent in assisted living.""

Go ahead and guess what my ""wander the world"" WFH flexibility is? That's right:

Zero."
"I work from home and from mothers home in another state.  Sometimes I work from my relatives in third state.
I work with global IT company, about 40 k employees"
I think that is still a small niche in WFH
"I work from home, work from my child's school, work from grandparents houses on holiday weeks etc etc."
"My home office. I have to be in Toronto for work quarterly, but don't live there, and my partner has to travel to his work city a couple times a year.


We have dogs, comfy desktops, and aren't earning enough to take off for months around the world, not for lack of wanting to. We do work from the cottage.."
"I technically have a contract that says I can only work in the office, or at my place of residence. It's for insurance purposes, because if I trip and fall and break my wrist in my home office, it's technically a work-accident, and it's not my insurance, but the company's that pays. But in reality, I could worm wherever I have internet."
"My credit union only set up for 3 states, I'm trying to move to a 4th, so will have to be a contractor and bouncing through the process of being a contractor. I'm an IT guy, I build data warehouses. 10 years with this company, 25 years in the industry

I currently live in WA, and tired of the rain. Looking to move to Arizona. Been WFH since just before COVID.

So many options where to move. Just need good  Internet. Interesting, I'm not a gamer, switched from Comcast fiber, to T-Mobile at current place- only get ~130mbs download, all video meetings, and such work fine. However, I am just remoting to HQ virtual machine, where all my heavy lifting things happen. $30 a month way cheap too."
"Fintech.

Company allows 3 months work per year overseas, in addition to our normal 100% WFH.

I used some of it to spend 3 weeks working and travelling round New Zealand in December."
"I almost did one of the travel/work/vacation thing. There are companies that setup and plan everything for a group of people to work. Some sort of business center is always available and they have other activities. They have different lengths available, 3 months, 6 months and etc. 

Depending on group size this might be better then a dating app/service. It's going to be 90% young people who make good money working remotely."
"People in my department I work remote from each other and our clients are remote as well, so is our management. I could probably relocate because my company has offices in different parts of the United States and the world, so I would have to check it out ahead of time, but if they already have something set up there, I could probably move there and continue the same job. But I would have to bring the whole computer, it is not a laptop. And then we would have to get me set up. It's just easier to stay at my current home office."
"My job allows us to work anywhere in the US and parts of Canada. As long as we are still doing our job it doesn't matter where I'm doing it. I recently went on an emergency trip to another state and didn't have any problems. It sucked to not have my home office stuff and monitors but it was doable. If I were to move to another state I would need to let them know but just working wherever for a little while, that's cool.

Edit to include I work for a bank."
"Tulum Mexico and Cabo San Lucas have a huge remote worker community now, the time zones are perfect for american companies and they have some of the best weather in the world. 

If it was me I would move to Bend, Oregon. It is surrounded by 100s of miles on all sides by parks and is big enough for large city amenities. While its not cheap in the city anymore, if you are fully remote you could get an awesome mountain cabin. Oregon has low taxes as well. If you are richer and like the snow, the Nevada side of Tahoe is a close second for my top remote work area."
I work in insurance.  100% remote. If I feel like working somewhere other than my home office I just gotta let the boss know snd off I go.
"I know a lot of video game companies offering remote work.  Some let you travel work outside the country as long as it is within tax rules, and of course, you can legally work as a nomad in that country."
"I work full time for a large university as a software dev, and have been 100% remote since 2016. I usually work from my home office, but if it is a nice day, I am outside in my garden. I also work part time for the same university as an adjunct professor, most of my courses are remote so those usually are done from my backyard/garden or home office. On rare occasions I do go to my onsite office - but that is only when I want to do something in the town where the school is located in the evening."
"In my case, I just work from home 
It's way easier when I travel for sure, but I live close to my family so I just normally work from my home, sometimes in coffeeshos or restaurants...
For my employeer it makes 0 difference if I'm home or in the other side of the planet, I just need to worko EST hours and it's ok for them"
My company encourages digital nomadism. B2B EdTech for tech workers. I'm in sales. My boss is in a new country every month or so. I prefer the comfort of my home office & then elect to visit my wife's home country for several months at a time. 
"SaaS startup within cybersecurity. Our product helps IT managers keep devices for remote workers secure, so yeah, would be strange if they forced us to work in office."

I have a lot of screens"
Where is this at? I'm in need of a WFH job!
"Thank you, I should have clarified I meant why are these companies good options for remote work anywhere in the world? Typically I find that these companies are MORE strict with tracking your work location"
"You aren't living there. You have to check into the laws of each country. Many allow remote work and do not consider that to be ""working"" in their country for tax purposes."
"What is your degree in? and How did you end up landing this job/role?

Generally curious.

I'm a current general dentist so I LOVE seeing/hearing about the WFH perspective because I would absolutely love to do that one day but my career does not really allow for that lol."
WFH should be the standard even if only for the climate.  ;)
"Hi I'm a content writer who wants to focus more on WFH initiatives. May I feature your site in a short article on Medium?

Totally agree!  I've been working remotely for almost 3 years.  I love it!
"Unfortunately some have ruined remote work fir all of us. There's idiots posting on TikTok about how they don't actually work while ""working at home"". Now employers aren't trusting employees to work remotely"
"I work from home and love it.  My question is why are employers forcing people back in the office?  I assume it's a bunch of different reasons but I just don't understand.  Most people I've talked to who have to go into an office are miserable about having to go and be there 3 to 4 days a week.  A friend of mine hates it but she gets paid really well and hasn't found anything else yet that is remote.   She hates commuting and sitting around the office working on her laptop which she could do from home.  She is still in a bunch of zoom meetings which she could also do from home.   She said being in the office is pointless to be successful at her job.
One person I know cheats the system by going to the office, badging in, sticking around a few minutes and then leaving because their company only checks badging in and there's no requirement to badge out plus no one in the office cares cause most are doing the same.   Some at my company go in because they actually don't mind being in the office but they also aren't required to go in either...it's their choice."
"Hello there, what kind of remote work do you do ?"
Remote work is awesome. That's the reason I'm looking for a remote job right now.
"Working remotely is stressful, lonely, and generally awful... but idk how it's even possible for two parents to both work in person between school holidays, sick days, doctors appointments."
"As a chronic migraine sufferer, remote work has been a job and lifesaver!"
"It's not about trust, it's about productivity. Anyone who isn't producing quality work gets put on an improvement plan and eventually fired if they don't step up. Only an idiot manager would let a handful of slackers ruin remote work for everyone."
I second this! Overhead lights trigger migraines so quickly for me! WFH is quite literally the best!
"need more non-coding positions. there are lots of fields that can WFH, and those should be represented as well"
"Yes!! They have ridiculous old school fluorescent lights at the office and they literally hurt my eyes and trigger headaches. Some of my team members and I removed the bulbs from the ones above our cubes and they yelled at us and put them back. So we draped black cloth over them and they yelled at us again and took it down. 

We told them it's really hard on our eyes when we are coding all day and they don't give a fuck. Now that I control my own lighting in my home office the headaches have stopped... and they wonder why we are refusing to RTO."
You took a 10K pay cut. Your loss in wages had nothing to do with remote work.
"The downside of remote work is that you do tend to have to work a lot harder, especially since people abused it during the pandemic, especially now that RTO is a thing and trust is in short supply.  I do the work of a team of people."
"Respectfully, this doesn't seem like it has anything to do with remote work per se.  

If you're almost about to go to the hospital from stress then that's a problem no matter where you spend your time during working hours. And taking a pay cut out of desperation makes sense in the moment but definitely one of those decisions where it's clear to see the impulsivity after the fact. 

In general yes doing what you can to make up for lost income (cutting expenses, getting a new job that pays better, etc.) is a good idea but you rushed into this current predicament and you could do it all again. It's hard to go against instincts and slow down but I think you might need to do that first before doing anything else."
Remote work does offer that sweet freedom
"I did the same thing, took a pay cut for an in-office job and commute thinking it would help my burnout. I made it 3 months. Exactly 3, then realized how burnt out I truly was. Suffered a week-long migraine when I finally stopped pushing myself. Couldn't read job descriptions for two weeks, the job requirements looked like gibberish. I decided to work for myself for a while (I was fortunate to have income and insurance through my husband and his FT job, as well as savings while I got myself together) as a freelancer and it's been about six months. All the crushing weight of chaos and demands from two back to back toxic jobs finally left me around the three-month mark. I'm ready to go back to full time because I took the break I so desperately needed.

So I definitely don't judge you for what you did and why. I was the same way, thought it would fix things. What did fix things was taking a break I know not everyone is fortunate enough to do. I also fixed things by realizing I was depressed from more than just job hunting and was brave enough to go to the doctor to ask for help. Between the meds which make me feel more like myself again and setting my own hours, I feel brand new and ready for anything again...as long as the work is remote.

TLDR: I did the same thing and realized my mistake. Took time for myself, tackled other contributing life issues, and now I'm ready for remote work again. Set your boundaries at future gigs and stick to them!"
No honey. You're supposed to counter wfh with more money not less.
Remote work is not for you.  But you took a pay cut.  Why do that?  Negotiate a raise or get another job for what you're worth.
"The best would be hybrid position to get exposure to enough social time. Remote work can be pretty lonely. 

In the long run, happy hour and socializing can help you make more money by exposing you to more people and better opportunities. Something to think about. Obviously can't afford to do this all the time and it's okay to say no once in a while."
"Find another remote job... I'm sorry but the days of working in office are long gone... Employers need to start realizing the amount of money that employees have to pay for gas for food for parking and everything else that comes along with it is not factored in to your normal pay sorry no way... And most people changed their everyday lives to accommodate their work from home whether it be a low lease mileage car, negating daycare or child care, switching schedules with their spouse or significant other to be home or not home to care for the child..."
"You were burned out working from home? Try again with limits & boundaries for example, do not work after or before hours. Learn to say no! Enjoy life while working from home. Get exercise, eat well, & be sociable with others. I work from home & love it."
"Love my hybrid job! I work 4 - 10s so 2 days in office 2 days at home. But I also super love my coworkers, managers & the department culture so it's nice to switch it up :). I get burnt out if I'm stuck at home for days on end. But I also have a kid and puppy so for me going into the office is rejuvenating and the only thing I have to focus on. When I work from home I have to juggle a lot more and I actually get interrupted way more than in office. Something to look into!"
"It sucks that the competition for remote work is so high right now, but I think it says a lot about how companies need to rethink flexibility as a whole. Banking experience is definitely valued! And people are always going to need banks/financial services"
"This isn't true at all. Depending on your field you have responsibilities at all hours, because you have to keep the train going. So when you work from home you change your life style up to balance that shift. Maybe you take an hour lunch or you break up the day with a 30 min gaming session or laundry. You don't always have to be pushing buttons, but then again some companies track your activity on the computer because they are not tracking performance by activity."
"Looking for hybrid jobs is a good idea. You mentioned on another comment that you are potentially moving to a new city soon ... If you know what city you will be moving to, maybe look into hybrid jobs there or near there. 

Considering you were burnt out at your WFH job, I don't hink it was a ""stupid mistake"" to leave for a different job. Current job might not be ideal but you are employed & hopefully have been recovering from the burn out.

Edit: typo"
"Is it possible some, or most, of these people entered the work force during Covid and thought WFH was somewhat the norm? For the rest of us having mental health issues, other issues, family issues, working far from offices, hating every second of it....welcome to the club we suffered through it cuz, ya know, bills and stuff. I feel a level of naivety/delusion/entitlement in the posts."
Seems to me like many people think wfh is slacking off or half-assed work. If you have a skill and can work efficiently you likely can waste hours a day not working. If your doing data entry or call center work however your either getting consistent calls or your output is very measurable and your going to be really scrutinized to the point you may not even be able to tske a pee break in your own house and wfh may not be what you think it is
"Grind in an entry level sales role in an industry that has lots of remote opportunities for remote work for mid+ tier sales reps, grind and do what it takes to get one of those jobs, then you're remote and making good money in sales. Probably the easiest/fastest way to do it without any hard skills like software engineering or specific in-demand degrees"
"Great posts, but unfortunately a lot of people are:
1. Oblivious 
no special skills or exp related to remote work but want a remote job

2. Felt entitled as freaking F
Just because they're burnt out, hate their current job, too low pay, have personal problems. Doesn't mean you're automatically entitled to a remote work by just posting in a subreddit. 

3. Delusional 
Not sure what people smoke here. But DAYUMM with a capital D. Why in the freaking why would they post that they're looking for remote work like recruiters are reading their post that don't say anything about a person at all. Like dude, if people are going to hire them for remote work, they hire through a platform that shows the candidate's capability, not through reddit that especially has anonymity. Like recruiters are reaching out to random people that has randomly generated reddit usernames. Nobody bothers using common sense anymore.

Phew, rant over. Find jobs that fit y'all. Not everyone can have the luxury."
"The amount of comments here that suggest wanting remote work is entitled are insane. We all went through covid didnt we??? No major effects were seen. It was nicer for the planet.

Insane how humans behave when something is in scarcity."
"All of those posts about applying to dozens of random WFT jobs and not getting any interviews are very telling. If you want a WFT job, then find a WFH job in the field you actually work in. If you don't have that yet its not for you, not sure why people expect to get the job when they are in competition with people who have their degree and ten years experience in the field.

Especially the data science jobs, that field is competitive for people with their masters in data / comp sci, why would the company hire someone who has no experience of demonstrated interest over people who clearly do."
"This is very true. ""Work from home"" is not a job or job description. It is a feature or aspect of an actual job. While it's a make or break aspect for many people, you'd toll need to focus a search on an actual industry or field or skill. Too many people think they can apply to WFH, Inc. and get placed at a company like applying to a McDonald's. 

It's usually those people who think like this because they don't have any skills or experience to offer an employer."
I work for a Fortune 50 and we went completely WFH. We closed offices all over the US and downsized our headquarters. I manage a team of 30 ppl that live all over the US from home.
"My company has thousands of people working remotely in America. From customer service to upper level managers. 
Be a claims rep. Customer service. Remote nurse case manager. 
No experience? Start out in customer service and work your way up. 
Work in intake. Where claims are initially setup. 
Pretty easy to get fully remote."
"The lack of effort is astounding in all the WfH subs.

We do not need life stories. In that time, you could have Googled 50 jobs. 

DO NOT lead employment conversations with what ails you. 

There were about a dozen of us who thought mining Reddit for job seekers would be great. Help people along and pick some primes. 

I get told I AM WRONG about positions I recruit for. You answer a question honestly, and people down vote you to hell.

WHO IS EMPLOYED FOLKS? The very people you so desperately want to know you troll.

Have fun."
"Your post reeks of entitlement. My job had me WFH for 2yrs during the plandemic. Over the past 1yr they're transitioning to back in the office and reducing hybrid days. I think most people have the sentiment of ""if I could do my job remote why can't I continue to work remote?"" The only reason they want us back on-site is because they've purchased / rented this building and need people to fill it with. It's not because employees did a bad job during the plandemic. Furthermore, covid cases are still a major thing it's just that the government doesn't care anymore. Fuck the people"
"My wife does medical billing/payment processing. Both her recent jobs are WFH (she changed because I moved for a new job).  She was a supervisor in her first one when COVID hit, and they went WFH and stayed there. As long as you have basic computer skills, you can get started. Pay isn't great to start, but you can move up quickly at a lot if companies. She started at $25k, and left making $50k. My job can be done remote, project scheduling, but you need to have experience in the scheduling software to get a really good job. Primavera is a very in-demand skill, and I see jobs listed for $75-$100k all the time"
Absolutely. I've been doing my job for years and made WFH part of the negotiation of doing my job.
There are so many WFH jobs! The problem is you often have to spend weeks training in office
"I've been working  remote for 10 years, but this was already having a decade of  experience in my field and working in an office first.  Unless you are further along in your career, it's very difficult to get a good remote job.

If you do, it will be shitty because the company won't trust you and you will be watched constantly (because it's so easy to slack off).

I would also like to point out that most people can't handle working remotely (I've seen lots of coworkers try and fail).  Very little socialization compared to an office, requires constant discipline to get work done on time, and it's easy to get distracted (kids, things at home ,etc)."
"When I was working remotely for a call center job I got really lucky it was with a place that didn't have back to back calls constantly, I don't think otherwise I'd be able to handle the stress lol it was really easy."
Working remotely from home is extremely boring. I wish I have office job back but I have difficulty finding one that will match the pay.
"I think that believing WFH is the the norm would require ignorance of the normal workplace. Anyone who entered the workforce during the pandemic would have been old enough before the pandemic to know that most people don't work from home.

I think it could be that people saw WFH during the pandemic and thought it would become the new normal. Unfortunately, it hasn't.

Some people want to work from home because they believe it will allow them to goof off a lot. And some people genuinely want to work, but, for various reasons, it would be much easier to do it from home. I think the people we see that are yearning for a WFH job are people who haven't yet learned that the workplace *does not care* about what's best for workers. The workplace is all about getting as much as it can from you and giving you as little as possible in return."
"I wish it was possible. I really do. A lot of people would benefit from being able to work from home doing all kinds of things. Yes, wfh is not exactly what people think it is, it's not all naps and Netflix, but there's a zillion reasons why it could be the best option for someone.

Unfortunately, with the advancements in AI, all data entry jobs are going to become more scarce, regardless of work location. It would be great if people with an average skill set could make a living wage, from home or from anywhere, but that's not the world we live in."
"That's the sad truth isn't it? Also, they see people who are still WFH and think, why can't I? But again, most people still WFH have a high level of skill/experience that allows them to do so."
"I agree that remote work possibility does depend on your job and industry. 

However I believe the pros of remote work are much higher in number than the cons. Employees gain flexibility, autonomy, and are likely to be happier and therefore more productive for the business.

Your logic seems like ""well if I have to suffer, so does everyone else"". This is an unhealthy mindset and I wish you help,. 

As humans, we are allowed to want things that benefit our mental wellbeing and lifestyles. If remote work was more common, we would reduce stress levels in our society and likely reduce the negative aspects of society."
I had fully remote work this year too
"I agree that ""we are allowed to want things that benefit our mental wellbeing and lifestyles"" but that in no way means we are entitled to it based on one's personal circumstances today. 

You can tell your company you are entitled to remotely work all you want, but they may not give it to you. You may look for a fully remote job, but never find one. You may want a remote job, but your job/industry isn't conducive to working remotely so you have to change careers/industries. This is why working remotely is entitled. 

Also, not everyone thrives working remotely and for some it actually causes more harm to their mental wellbeing and lifestyle, just like working in an office might cause you more harm. 

Lastly, not that it really matters, but I'm 100% remote and will never need to back into the office at my current job and from what I can see, probably never in my career. Sorry to disappoint, but I definitely do not have the ""well if I have to suffer, so does everyone else"" mentality. I believe everyone should be able to choose, but I don't run the company."
"Employment agency leads to in house corporate
Recruitment roles and many of those
Are wFH"
"They are just trying to fill seats, have extremely high turnover, and unreasonable strict policies.

My wife has worked at several and all have been terrible.

Have read similar accounts in many WFH Facebook groups"
I do a 15 minute kettle bell routine in the morning and afternoon. I do a 2 mile walk/light jog at lunch. I can't imagine giving up my WFH lifestyle. I get more work done and my health has improved.
"Working remotely means ""office"" pajamas are the new power suits!

 But seriously, great advice here. I've become a true believer in the ""get outside"" and ""bedtime alarm"" hacks. They've made a world of difference in my remote work life."
"I've got some nice plants in my home office. They remind me to take a step back, relax and simply watch them grow."
"This isn't a WFH list it's a introvert list. Nothing of what you said has to do anything for WFH.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an introvert. 

Cold showers - heck no?!? HOT! VERY HOT! I like it when it burns baby!

Everything else - yes, to maybe. 
I don't believe in ""Wise Council"". Nobody is wise -- everyone is an idiot. Just have to find a few people you can go to that won't insist on coming over or talking on the phone that know the one thing you need a check on but otherwise avoid people!"
I live in a van and remote work basically I'm outside all day or in my van so yeah I probably have my mental health sorted better than most with the sunshine exercise and my husband to hold me accountable and make my food. He keeps me from getting too stressed working too much and drinking too much caffeine.
"Really appreciate these ideas, thank you!  I've been working remotely since Mar 2020 and have lately been feeling lonely during the day.  Reaching out to friends for a quick chat, snuggling with our golden retriever puppy, stepping outside for a walk in the woods, meditating, all have helped me on occasion though I haven't been as consistent and disciplined with it as I probably need to be."
Man I needed this - any other advice is welcome. Since covid WFH has changed me. I go in sometimes but would love some more advice- thanks for the cafe tip!
I need to try some of these out. I'm struggling with remote work. I feel like I have cabin fever sometimes.
Seems like decent paying wfh jobs are drying up :-(
"I worked for a fin-tech company that watched Teams like a hawk. If I went yellow for more than 3 minutes I was getting an e-mail and phone call. Kinda hard to answer from the bathroom  From the moment my boss logged on in the morning everything was a crisis. The amount of micromanagement caused me to have a nervous breakdown. I took a 2 month leave of absence due to my mental health. I worked for them for 8 years - always remote, always exceeded expectations, never had a single problem until I was involuntarily transferred to a new position under a new manager who was an absolute nightmare. 
When I got laid off the end of 2021 it wound up being the best thing that ever happened to me. 
I've been at my current job 2 years and I don't take a single day for granted. I have no customer or client interaction so my boss does not care how I put in my 40 hours. If I want to work from 9 pm - 3 am it is no issue. I've never missed a deadline, my client is absolutely thrilled with the work I do and having flexibility and freedom (especially with a family) is amazing. 
I've said the change in jobs must be like what it feels like getting out of prison. 
All that said, I couldn't be on camera all day. I can't imagine the stress that has to cause feeling like someone is staring at you all day every day. I think it would be distracting, actually. 
I hope that you're able to find a WFH position that fits your needs and isn't so strict."
"No. I don't micromanage my team at all. All I ask is  is they keep their outlook calendar up to date (which I have access to). If someone doesn't consistently answer my calls or doesn't call back then yea, I would tighten the reins but that hasn't been the case since we began remote work.  

You should give the folks you hire their independence and trust them. Assume they will act like professionals. If I couldn't trust one of my employees, I would just fire them. It just doesn't work if I can't trust you. 

This is part of the reason I don't understand the micromanaging part. If you don't trust someone and you feel like you always have to stay on top of them. Why are they even working for you?

All that said you should find a new job"
"This has nothing to do with remote work.

This is about a paternalistic, overbearing, controlling employer.

Leave as soon as you find something"
"W
T
F

This is as far from normal as you can get. RUN away - don't walk. Your current management/leadership has decided paying for legal spyware is simpler than creating effective KPI's to measure your productivity. More likely your manager and his peers feel this is the only way to justify their jobs. 

I'm 100% permanent WFH (I live several states away from where my org is located). We have thoroughly thought out and developed KPI's to measure employee performance. In my manager's own words (literally have this in an email which has been printed and framed above my desk) ""I expect you to meet all your KPI metrics, be available via Teams for questions from the team and/or emergencies during working hours, and be online for all scheduled meetings. Otherwise, I do not care how many hours you work, what hours you work, where you work from, or what else you do during the day.""

You sir/madam are a working professional, not a defiant teenager. If you are not being treated as such, you absolutely should immediately start looking for a new employer that WILL do so. 

In the meantime, make this as uncomfortable as possible for everyone involved outside official scheduled meetings. Go the entire day wearing a highly offensive t-shirt (or no shirt at all). LOUDLY pass gas or belch when you feel someone is watching. Have a small speaker nearby playing Gregorian Chants or Tuvan throat singing JUST loud enough to register on the microphone but not loud enough that whomever is watching can definitely say you're listening to music. Decide that your new hobby will be starting a Wu Tang Clan tribute group and (badly) recite the lyrics while you are working. Get a bunch of cheap mirrors from resale shops and install them on every surface around you then add as many lights as humanly possible around your work area.

Remember that malicious compliance can be a way of life for you, and a thoroughly satisfying one at that."
Noooo. Not my WFH experience at all.
"I have to check in once each week on camera. Every Tuesday at 1:30 pm. Your company is out of their mind, and it likely comes down to a single individual who doesn't want any wfh employees."
That is not the norm. I've been working remotely for two years and I'm completely autocratic. There's something wrong with a company that treats you like you can't be trusted without you proving your worth.
"First, I haven't seen this in remote work from myself or anyone I know.

Second, I'll just note that there are other ways to verify people are doing their job via things like reasonable goals and reasonable timeframes to get them done.  If you don't make it in that time frame, then either it's too difficult or you're not actually working.  

Then, whether you're napping or going to the gym or graphing the migrations of birds, it doesn't matter because you're getting your work done.  That's what should be important to the company.  If your problem is you have high performers who do everything in half the time it takes the rest of your employees, you don't punish them while they watch movies on their shift.

I'll also note that people goof off during onsite work all the time, so this is a radical departure by some bonkers paranoid CEO or senior manager.

Lastly, there's also something called ""knowledge"" work which often involves thinking and not actually doing anything with the computer.  There's a great book on this called ""Thinking Fast and Slow"".  Working through a problem, how to approach something, or being stuck with a political situation often doesn't mean actually touching the computer.  

But it's still work.

I would start looking for another role.  Despite the other positive aspects, that sounds deeply problematic and will only get more intrusive."
"As a manager for wfh.  

We can view your screen.  
We can watch what you do. 

We check your aux status 

If you deviate from what is considered appropriate by the company then we have discussions 

With that being said.  When it comes to aux abuse then the  gets real. 

I've had to term people for making out bound calls for no reason. 

For sitting in offline for hours 

For signing out and not submitting time. 

Pretty much it's super chill however if you get in trouble it's cause you done screwed up"
"I have a hybrid job with different levels of wfh depending on the week (some of my colleagues make it work to wfh 4 days, but I like to be flexible with my clients where I can).  When I'm at home, I don't just do nothing, but I also don't have a job with a lot of eb, since I work in human services.  Sure, there are days where I take breaks to look at my phone and I do take walk breaks sometimes.  I'm not constantly productive and during trainings, I turn my camera off and chill.  We are generally trusted by our org to do our jobs.  I have to keep an outlook calendar with appointments, and my boss wants to know if I'm at home or in office.  But otherwise, nobody dictates what I do and I'm trusted by my company.  Some people in the office even flex their days and get stuff done evenings instead- they don't care as long as it gets done.


Edit: sorry, I didn't answer the question.  I don't think your place of work is normal.  It sounds like how they treated us during distance learning when I was teaching, which is why I left that profession."
"These types of tools cost money, and I'd say most remote first companies aren't trying to spend the amount it takes to have tools like this. It seems like larger firms sometimes will though.

That being said, as you're scoping out a new job, I'd google more about the common tools and ask questions about this in the interview, such as, ""how is productivity managed and give me an example of the type of results the company expects to see on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis."" You may not get a great answer but it's worth a try. 

I think for most of us salaried wfh individuals, as long as you're responsive via tools like teams and outlook and you deliver your work by meeting or beating expectations, we kind of do what we want otherwise. 

Some days I work 4-6 hours, others I work a full 8 (or more). But most days I still get to take a mid-day shower whenever or sometimes cook lunch, maybe sometimes go run an errand during the day etc."
"Had a similar experience in a wfh sales position. We had several breakout rooms for each team within the sales division, and cameras had to be on, along with microphones. 

Lower paying jobs for some reason like to get weird with their rules. I couldn't stay more than a few months because it was just too much. 

You want to see how productive I am? It can be done easily without needing access to my camera all day."
Hello i'm a remote worker and previously in cyber. I would expect the company to have endpoint detection on the computer to monitor for potential harmful activity but this seems overkill and harmful. I would look for a job elsewhere.
"Def not the norm that is some hardcore big brother shit. I would look for a new job asap. I work from home and it's the first job I've ever had where I was not micromanaged at all and it took time for me to get used to it! Lol like I was worried if I wasn't busy but also no one is asking me lol and we have unlimited PTO, and if I'm like hey I have this appt I gotta run to but I'll work later to make up for it, they're like cool. We communicate, do our jobs and that's it. I'm a designer so I don't have to ""talk"" to anyone either public wise. We have a weekly creative meeting via zoom, I have a weekly meeting with my team I started with to say hi and check in - see faces. And that's it. Most meetings I have no one even has their camera on cuz we are sharing screens and talking about the WORK. 

There are great WFM jobs out there - I def recommend looking elsewhere and giving this job a big ol Glassdoor review warning people."
"I wfh. Get online whenever. Im an expert in a field though and do all of the international logistics for a medium-large corporation.

What are they gonna do, fire me? Lol."
"Start searching for a new job. My camera has been unplugged for several months. We might be asked to be on camera a couple times a year.
As long as I'm taking care of my assigned, work. Which that is monitored through reports and things like that. I often listen to podcasts.
I don't take advantage of my work from home and I'm honest about when I am working. 
I have no intentions of messing up my gig.

Your job is not the norm that is way over the top.
Even customer service people at my company while their time is managed. 
They are not required to be on camera at all"
Not sure where other wfh reps are located but this is not the norm for wfh in the US. I feel my company is super strict bc I can tell when they log onto my computer (to check what I'm doing I guess) but I don't have a camera on me and I am allowed couple min btwn calls to wrap up.
"This sounds like a bad company to work for.  I would look for another role.  As a remote worker, my values are identical to yours but even in my role I am not monitored at all (thankfully).   Then again, most people in the company can barely spell the name of the business that employs them."
"That's insanity. I'll never work for a company like that if I can help it. Look for something else OP. Also in regards to your third paragraph, I don't think people that go to the gym or nap during their workday should be called out as ruining WFH. If tasks are done and the work is done well, then who cares how people utilize the rest of their time. They aren't ruining WFH for anyone, they just work for employers that care about the work being done and not necessarily the hours it takes to complete a task. If you had a situation like that I don't think you'd be complaining."
"Well as others have said, start looking for a new job. I wor hybrid and my company (small healthcare) controls how we work by using a productivity software that takes screenshots of your screen every 10 minutes and counts the clicks you make every 10 minutes. Then produces a productivity percentage that appears on the screenshot. Anything above 51% is good and desired. We got this a couple months ago (because some wfh workers not meeting demands) and now every one has to use it even the ones that are in the office full time. Even If Im chilling in the office, I think no one should be monitored. My roomies on other hand spend 15 hrs per week and sleep most of the time or play games during work hours. With market so bad I dont wanna switch employers either"
"From everyone i know who is WFH, your requirements sound insane.

Most of the time, even in meetings we dont have camera's on.  I would absolutely go nuts having my camera on all day long.  

i have music blasting all day long, hell half the time i've got some random tv show running in the background, just for some noise...  i'll get up and hit the restroom if i need to, or grab a drink or snack... i work with sensitive stuff all day long but the room i'm in is a disaster of random projects... i cant keep my desk clean if my life depended on it.  

Run from this company, and feel free to warn others so no one else lands in this trap... my job has it's ups and downs, and often when i think of leaving i'm terrified of landing in a place that you are describing.  but i know dozens of people who are working remote, all with completely different companies, completely different industries and roles, and not a single one is like what you described."
"I have a friend that when WFH because of covid started, they had to keep a video chat window open all the time. But I think that would be pretty rare. I could days without chatting with anyone."
"That is absolutely ridiculous. I'm currently hybrid, but my previous position was remote during Covid, and we only had to turn cameras on during meetings. I don't have to use my camera when I wfh at my current job."
I interviewed with a company that explained their wfh setup includes a mirrored physical monitor in my supervisors office. I stopped the interview and told them I'm not a child and not interested in a company that would treat me as such. 
"what industry are you in? In most industries, this is not normal, but for some, it is - meaning that it won't be any better in a similar wfh role."
I was WFH way before pandemic hit from 2015-2018. Your employer should not be invading your privacy using cameras for your entire shift! I can understand a camera for work meetings but that is it! I really don't think that is normal at all.
"I sure hope that's not normal...based on some of the other comments here, glad to hear people agree it's the exception rather than the rule. I get some of the paranoia from managers and companies about WFH giving people opportunity to slack off (trust me I've already seen my fair share of coworkers who have gotten away with that over the last few years) but if it's bad enough there are ways to get rid of them. My boss is not a micromanager at all, is very trusting, and I don't get the sense that I'm actively monitored (although I don't know for certain). It's the responsibility of any manager to know how to set expectations clearly and then assess whether they're met in a reasonable way.  


Edit: OP are you willing to disclose the company so others can steer clear of this invasive behavior?"
"Not al all.I pretty work [independently.No](https://independently.No) one is micromanaging me.We have a team meeting once a week where we have to be on camera.Other than that, we are on our own.I WFH as a claim analyst at Elevance health"
"I've been WFH all the time since 2020 and no, this kind of surveillance is not done.  That said, the company probably does track logins and stuff, but not via camera."
"This is not normal. Post-Covid, my company embraced a 50% WFH model. Actual in office attendance depends on the department. Thankfully, my boss is amazing and treats all of us like the adults we are. She knows if we put in extra hours so if we finish a major project and get it submitted, she has no problem if we take the rest of the day off. 

I'm sure there's some sort of overall tracking--one person was fired, pre-Covid, because she wasn't actually online during the previously allowed single WFH day per week."
"I'd rather go into the office than deal with that nonsense, but honestly, I'd recommend finding something else where employees are treated like adults. We're not even required to be on camera for team meetings!

I'd be fired there immediately because one of the perks I love about wfh days is being able to work at my desk or the sofa. And if I'm on the sofa, my dog is absolutely snuggling up next to me!"
"That is crazy!! They don't need to monitor you by camera. They can easily monitor your computer to see if you are engaged and working. I'm mgmt and wfh so I'm not monitored at all. However, we do not monitor anyone in the company this way and we are a very large national company. It's very creepy, like voyeurism."
"That's crazy! I have a federal job, so obvious some higher security is needed with WFH, but we don't have anything like this."
"My last WFH job was at fully remote company, at my current job only 2 of us in the corporate office are remote. 

I've never heard of this. I'm on camera for meetings only. At my last company, I was also required to show whether I was available for calls or not, but it was fine to put myself as not available whenever I needed to get my kids from school or whatever. 

Find a company that values getting quality work done, not micromanaging."
"My mom works hybrid, when she's wfh she's not required to be on camera. Your job is not the norm, it's really invasive"
"Ew that's worse than in person, this is definitely not the norm at all  


I can't speak to companies other than the ones I've worked remote for but we always had enough work to where we could justify wfh, because frankly if you weren't at the computer then you wouldn't be hitting deadlines"
"Yep it is possible.  I have a job where I can be away for hours and come back and finish my work when I feel like it.  As long as the projects are done on time, they do not care how I work.  The company is super flexible and I have never been questioned about where I was.  Had the job 3 years.

The people napping and working out are not making WFH look bad.  If you have a business that actually cares about your health, then they are very flexible.  If your performance is stellar and you complete your work, who cares if you are taking breaks throughout the day?

Your job is pretty much an office job at home and the boss doesn't trust you.  Leave those places ASAP!  They are the ones making WFH look bad and apparently not the company anyone should work for."
"Geesh, that is crazy and a gross invasion of privacy! My immediate thought was to tell you to run and find another job immediately! But then I remembered, you like your supervisor and you like your work! I've quit most jobs that I've had because of an overbearing supervisor or I felt the work wasn't something I wanted to do. When you find these two things in a job with good pay, you've literally hit the jackpot. Sure, you may find a new job with a more relaxed WFH policy, but you may get a boss that makes your life very hard! So while I would never accept a position that required me to be on camera all day and wouldn't allow me to listen to music, I think it's important to consider all aspects before moving on. Just a different perspective that you may want to consider!"
"I've never heard of a company going this extreme.  I work for a large hospital system and I'm treated like a responsible adult, just working from home.  It's not required to be on camera for TEAMS calls, preferred, but not required.  I can have my phone on my desk, my radio on, my television on, and my boyfriend standing next to me talking.  The only thing I can think of that they would have an issue with is children at home.  If you worked in an office & needed child care, then you should have child care when you work from home, which I agree with.  I don't need someone sitting there stalking me while I work.  Honestly, I think that would cause me so much anxiety that I would get less done.  I don't normally take a lunch since I take my dog for a couple quick walks during the day, but honestly I could take a lunch & take my dog for a few walks and no one would care.  As long as I'm getting my work done, that's all that really matters.

I know not everyone is disciplined to work from home, but I think a company shouldn't go into it thinking everyone is a slacker.  They can tell who can handle it and who can't.  They don't need to monitor people to that extreme to determine that information.  

I worked with someone years ago and she never answered her phone & it took her forever to reply to emails and return voicemails.  We found out she had both her kids (infant & two years) at home so she didn't have to pay for daycare.  She was given the choice to work in the office or be terminated."
"oh hells no, get outta there man.  that's some twisted way of managing wfh employees.

and dish the name so no one applies to that company!"
"Depends.  

I'm a SME who wrote my check years back. Nobody says a damned thing to me as long as I turn in my deliverables. And I tell them when my deliverables are due.

But, I know people with 2x experience who are WFH for big companies and they get micromanaged and re-orged and so on. They get more pay and more benefits, but also more oversight."
". .. why do I feel like we work for the same company? Did yours just send out an email with all these crazy demands like mine just did in the last few days that prompted this post? Cuz mine outlined everything you just said, pretty much word for word that now has me thinking about finding a new job before the end of the year cuz it's so invasive and absolutely ridiculous expectations for people working from home. I really hope this isn't becoming an industry standard for work from home."
Holy crap that's insane! My remote workers work when they have time and I don't check in on them at all. As long as the work is done well I don't care if they're doing it while wearing a tuxedo and dancing the hula. If they need a nap they can take a nap. I wish more companies treated their team members like responsible adults.
">On social media I see other WFH people talking about napping and going to the gym during the workday. I don't want that and in my opinion people who pull that shit are ruining WFH for the rest of us by making us look bad. However it DOES make me wonder if I just chose a bad company and most aren't like this. 

You're making a big generalization here. It's okay, though. I worked in Corporate America for almost 20 years and worked from home for them for 5 years. I was never heavily monitored and took 2 hour breaks and was never questioned about it. I work for myself from home now, so I definitely have the liberty to do what I want. But to hold other people to the standards you're being held to by saying THEY are ""ruining WFH"" for everyone else is a huge generalization. Not everyone shares the same requirements with their job as yourself. 

Personally, I'd like to encourage you to work with employers who trust their employees. This type of heavy monitoring is unnecessary and invasive. It can take a toll on you mentally."
"My WFH job does really no monitoring.  We have a timesheet we have to fill out where we log in the hours we worked (we have different clients we do work for and we log in the hours we worked on what duty for what product and what client).  But that's about it.

The general premise of my job, since it's salary, is that I should be available from 8-5 Monday thru Friday.  But it's all about doing the job, doing it well and not missing deadlines.  So my boss really doesn't care if I take a 3 hour nap during the day, just as long as I work the hours.  It doesn't matter to them if I do the work at 2am or 2pm.  And for most WFH jobs, I really don't see why it's not that way. I think demanding otherwise or having all of this strict monitoring with no good reason (unless you're working a government job) is just about people that have major insecurities and control issues."
"Well I guess I'm one of the people ruining it for the rest of you. 

My role was WFH from the start. My supervisor is very lax. We have to be available and on camera for weekly meetings but that is it. We also have teams and outlook on our phones. 

Any actual work can only be done before 11AM as that is when the system starts running and no changes can be made until midnight. So there is a lot of downtime. 

I go to the gym, clean the house, play video games, do whatever I want. I'd rather go back to an office than deal with what you are OP."
They're ruining wfh? No you're ruining it by capitulating to these insane rules.
"What app do you broadcast the camera using, or are they remotely enabling it?  Honesty when you work from home they know every keystroke, every instant message, every email, and everything you do on the web, any tickets in ticketing systems, etc.   A large employer culls all that data together and knows if you haven't done anything for 30 min or 1 hour you aren't at your desk.   They don't need a camera per say."
This is fucking insane. Please leave this job if you can they are doing way too much. I work from home and it's nothing like this. And I'm not even high up. 
"I WFH. Sometimes I nap or run errands in the middle of the day. I put: brb in 30 minutes in the chat. As long as I get my shit done, they don't care. Same for the rest of my team. I'm salary, on call for emergencies, and work with very sensitive information. That's some aggressive micromanage control freak shit right there. Get the fuck out."
"Holy shit no. I wfh and we are the least micromanaged you could be. If your shit is done and your deliverables are on time then no one cares. We're paid for our expertise, not our time."
I've never had a company do anything like that in 10 years + of remote work
"Yeah, this is insane. I work for a call center type job WFH, and I would not be able to do this. Had to turn down a job with Verizon because they disclosed that this would be the requirement. It's not okay."
So I lead a team of work from home agents and I can tell you that everything you are describing is absolutely insane. I would never think of subjecting my employees to this type of surveillance and I recommend you look for something else
"I wfh and end up working for 2 companies, one pretty big one small. Neither are like this at all (at least yet)."
"That's crazy. I WFH and being on camera is never a requirement. We do have Teams, and they monitor your availability through that (however, I've noticed my Team's switches to ""away"" whenever I am doing things  in a different program for an extended period of time - they've never said anything). I would definitely find a new job if being on camera for the entire workday was a requirement."
Umm. I would quit asap. And let them know in the exit interview their WFH policy is ridiculous.
Start looking for a new job ASAP. Why would I even want to work for a company that doesn't trust my capability to work from home and produce good results. I hope most of their employees leave; it's so unethical I can't believe this is a thing! Sorry you're in this position but I trust you will absolutely find something much better!
"Your job is insane, you should absolutely leave and find something else.

That being said - people who go to the gym or take naps are not ""ruining it for everyone else"" if they get their work done. Overbearing companies  who treat their employees like children are the ones ruining WFH. Companies that monitor employees to the extent you're experiencing are not doing so because ""a few people were napping on the clock"", they're doing it to establish control They don't see you as a person."
"My wife does a hybird model WFH 3 days and in office 2 days.   But on her WFH days, it's very laid back.  On her Teams/ Zoom calls she doesn't have to be on camera, and her boss really doesn't care when she gets her work done (11am or 6pm) as long as she gets it done for the day.  

Her boss' only requirement is to be available for the Teams calls or if a client has a question to try and promptly answer it.   Otherwise, it's very hands off. 

Even on her WFH days,  she does have time to do other stuff like every day from 12-1pm thats considered her ""lunch hour"" so during that time her away message is on ""At Lunch"" and she goes to the gym usually to avoid the night crowds."
">On social media I see other WFH people talking about napping and going to the gym during the workday. 

I'm my opinion that's pure BS. 

I also WFH and they have a way to track the time/activities inside the environment. Your boss could invest in that too. I think the camera thing sucks."
"I've been hybrid since 2012 and permanent remote wfh since 2017. I love it. 3 different companies and I can tell you my productivity speaks for itself. Responsiveness speaks for itself. Did you ping me and did it take 3 hours to reply? 5 seconds or a few minutes? There are ways to measure if you're working or not .  Crossing boundaries for continuous video monitoring is not the answer and quite honestly sounds like they are so many ways around this.

ETA - this is not normal. If this doesn't sit right with you - time to find an employer that allows autonomy."
"I haven't worked 100% whf, but my daughter has had two different wfh jobs since she graduated.  She isn't even required to use her camera during Teams calls... it's allowed but optional. The only thing they monitor is inactivity... if her mouse doesn't move or her keyboard isn't used for five minutes, it is logged.  Even then, I don't think they say anything so long as she is meeting her work goals."
"I had 2 WFH in 2020 & 2021 didn't require a camera. 
The next one require camera, but could snap my cover closed for minute or so to blow nose, etc 
Another 1 I only worked another one 2 days. Not only did they want us on camera all day, if they asked us we had to pick up camera and show them our desk & surroundings. I guess I said ""that's bullsh*t"" without muting my mic.   They didn't need my services, lol."
"WFH since 2010, never had anything like this. Find another job asap."
That's insane. I WFH and the only thing I'm required to do is log in to the remote desktop and be available by phone during work hours.
"Remote work should provide a sense of autonomy and flexibility, not make you feel like you're constantly under a microscope."
"It sure is! I've been remote WFH since Feb 2022, I was only on camera doing training and team meetings. My shift I work, answer calls which I was hired and trusted to do. Seems like the company is going to lose good employees with this nonsense. It's very evasive."
"Op is dealing with a crazy company that wants quasi-efficiency over quality.

From experience, just start looking. Work balance is a managers duty, if they want that level of expectation across the company, it's a VP pushing down. The more people that quit and explain why, the better.

Op, again, start looking and cover your cam. IF they even ask why it's covered, say it's privacy as they don't pay for your at-home office space. If they let you go, that's a possible unemployment situation on them while you continue to look.

Edit: All, your employers have spyware on what you do and what you visit. At the ""webcam always on"" level, they're logging EVERYTHING you do with the computer. Stay away from these biz's if you're WFH."
"As a WFH manager, I didn't care when you did the work but I did expect my team to be available during business hours when I or clients called.  My measurement was more production and less if you were in front of your computer 8 hours a day."
Most all wfh call center type jobs do
"It's also naive to think that allowing people to work remotely won't see a significant drop in productivity.

I suspect surveillance will go hand in hand with working remotely as an eventual new normal.  Especially the high paying remote jobs."
"It's completely deranged. No one I know works that way. But keep in mind that virtually everyone I know that WFH is a mid-career professional in legal, engineering, accounting, investment etc careers. But even the younger assistants or paralegal etc in place I've worked at are not treated that way. 

It's possible that this sort of deranged micromanagement has always been normal at call centers and the like, like someone suggested elsewhere in this thread. Who knows."
"No, it's normal for wfh call center type jobs.

Is that what you do?"
"I was wfh before the pandemic and this sort of thing is wild. We didn't even use Skype/ Teams/ Google meet, we used regular phones and conference lines. There never was a thought of people being on camera until the pandemic. As a manager I cannot imagine having my team all on camera like that. I would never do it. It's completely unnecessary."
"I'm barely 2 YOE working in the legal department of a company, as junior as it gets, and I WFH without my boss breathing down my neck. This is invasive, excessive, and should probably be reported to the Information Commissioner's Office"
My wfh call center role does not require us to be on camera
"I am a project manager at an energy company. With solar and wind on the scene now there are a lot of opportunities (on-site, WFH, some with local travel, some with travel all over US.) I absolutely love what I do, the downside is it is a bit of a roller coaster - boom or bust - and the benefits aren't great for me. No vacation days, no sick days, no paid holidays. If I need to work 4-10's to take a day off and not lose any hours they're fine with that but every company and client is different. One of my good friends is also a PM at a different company and she's monitored a lot more. Certain companies the benefits are better. Others are strictly 1099 positions (something I'm not interested in personally but it works for others.)

Edited - benefit information"
"Good managers understand that their employees are human and that they have rights. One of the benefits of work from home for a company is that since my bed is 5 feet from my computer, I can take a nap when I'm not feeling well, rather than having to end my day early and go home. I've had my supervisor tell me to go take a nap before. 

It sounds like your employer doesn't allow you any control over how you do your work. This is a sign of a bad job, whether remote or not."
">so my perception (probably incorrect) is that most employers don't want remote work and are looking for any excuse to treat everyone like my job treats me, so it would be better if people weren't being extra and posting about napping during the workday. 

You're right that they're looking for any excuse. If every single remote worker had never taken a nap ever anywhere in the world, they would idk still just come up with some other excuse to keep you under their thumb.

They aren't looking at data and making informed choices based on the best outcome. They've already decided what their position is and just make up bullshit to give it a veneer of legitimacy."
"This!!! I know someone who got in trouble for a conversation that took place in their home office off-call and off-meeting while working at Zillow. They never admitted to recording them in their office, but it was increasingly clear given their avoidance when confronted about it."
All call center type jobs are terrible whether you wfh or in office!
"Many have the camera on during the workday, but it's a minority..... I would say as many as 20% of wfh call center jobs do.

They don't listen all day, it's spot checking"
"It is factual.

A minority of wfh call center jobs use video monitoring but it's not abnormal. They also use everything else you mentioned.

The cameras are only spot checked. No one is constantly monitoring them.

There's a problem with some people working multiple jobs at once. Video monitoring makes that impossible"
"A minority of wfh call center companies do it, but it's certainly not abnormal"
"A minority do.  

Not most.  That's the part that's not factual.  We have call centers in 3 different countries that work for thousands of companies and none of them video monitor their work from home employees."
Got it..that's true then.  Thought you were saying most wfh cc's we're video recorded
"**The territory is wrong:**

*""They do want training, but I think a lot of them want free time, or the illusion of free time, sitting at home, where you don't have corporate protocols and procedures.""*

There's no *illusion* of free time. There is only actual free time. Not spending 2.5 hours in traffic is not an illusion. Being able to start dinner at 5 instead of 6:30 is not an illusion. Being able to see your kids in the morning is not an illusion.  Being able to balance work and life is not an illusion. AbovetheLaw is quoting a managing director, not an associate. Maybe ask a law firm associate or anyone below director level next time?

**Roadmap also wrong:**

*""From a younger employee's perspective, work from home often means ""you get to sit in your studio apartment in front of your laptop, and good luck--you're cut off from everything else,"" venture capitalist Marc Andreessen said last year at the American Dynamism Summit, warning that remote work has ""detonated"" the way we connect as a society.*

Young employees at my company need to be in the office maybe 4-5 days a week only for *initial training and orientations*. That is valuable. Offering some social events during work hours (compensated) also benefits new or remote employees who thrive in social settings. But feedback I've received from GenY staff is that they too hate the commute costs, fake ""culture"" and tiny open cubes.  Marc Andreessen is not a younger employee. He's not GenZ. He's not working class. He's not middle class.  He doesn't have to take public transportation or sit in a Covid/flu/RSV-superspreading cube farm. Want an opinion from GenY, ask them. Don't ask some out of touch rich VC what he thinks GenY wants. This is shitty reporting."
"The argument is ridiculous eventually. There are HUGE markets of skilled workers who are desperate for great work from home jobs. If companies don't want to, great, thanks for leaving all this skilled work in the market. What an opportunity for entrepreneurs who WANT to tackle the problems that come with work from home people. It's the Wild West and this should be a land grab.  Of course there are lazy idiots who will try and take advantage, just like people we have all worked with in the past who got fired for doing dumb stuff."
"What difference does it make that they want to work from home, they are not in charge??? I've wanted free lunch served every day in my office, and if they took a survey and asked I think they would find overwhelming positive responses to this. Yet, for the last 30yrs my employer has chosen not served me free lunch. Young people want to stay in their PJ's all day and work from a laptop on a couch. Employers are smarter then this and know the production goes to crap for 85% of the work force when trying to get WFH to be effective. RTO will continue to outpace WFH for several years to come."
"So those are all good points - and then managers will cite that one study done on call center workers in India to say that remote work decreases productivity for ""white collar"" work. 

As if foreign call center workers reading from a script are in any way comparable to US knowledge workers."
We're talking about people entering the workforce for the first time and how it's not true that they crave remote work less than previous generations.
Boomer Uber Driver incessantly comments under WFH and IT threads just to stir the pot. Get driving geezer!
"Foreign call center workers are also way underpaid and have shitty work conditions. I sympathize with them too.
At some point they will also get even more f'd over. They aren't the enemy; greedy C-suite micromanagers are. 

You are right, execs don't give a shit, they cite their own highly suspect sources (usually opinion pieces, not data) to justify their argument. The time to fight this arrogant stupidity is now. If you are a manager in a company implementing strict RTO, look for another job. If you are an employee, look for another job. Talk to others, but not via emails or Slack. Encourage others to get out, but not in emails or messages.  If your company isn't monitoring in-office attendance, look the other way if your employees WFH on non-designated days. Do as much as you can, when you can, how you can, to fight this tide or we will get pulled under."
This person literally comments in every remote work thread lol. How bored do you have to be to keep this up? Imagine that.
"Pregnant and planning on staying home for a year. 
You want a job will give you maternity leave (legally they have to), will let you stop working to feed your baby every 2-3 hours, will let you stop working whenever your baby is crying, will let you stop working to change your baby whenever it's dirty, will let you stop working whenever your baby needs to be out to sleep.
Oh baby woke back up because you were talking too loud, time to hang up with the client and stop working to put the baby back to sleep.  What do you think work from home is? Just because you work from home doesn't mean you can do whatever you want during work hours. You still have to work. You don't know what you are looking for so you clearly don't have any marketable qualifications nor experience, or you would looking in that area. On top of all that, you want to make your own hours. I've been working in  my field for over 10 years and even though I have amazing flexibility working from home yet there are still times when I can't step away from a call. You want to be able to do all that on an entry level position. Thats not how working from home works."
"I was a remote worker two years before Covid. I chose my field back in the early 2010s in large part due to the prevalence of remote work. 

In 2022 I had to suffer through a RTO call. I discovered that I literally cannot do my job in person. My social anxiety is too strong in a professional environment . 

Remotely I can speak to hundreds of people over teams and lead project portfolios. When the RTO call happened, I was leading two US teams and a team in India. Very successfully. 

In person, in 2022 after the RTO call, I was giving a presentation to 4 people and broke down sobbing, begging my boss to let me stop. I literally could not function in my role. My productivity nose dived. Nothing was getting done - except for my India team, who I obviously had to work with remotely. Their successes kept me from being fired I'm sure. 

I wasn't fired from that job, but I was set to rapidly lose career ground sitting there. I QUICKLY found another remote job as soon as I could. Doing quite well now. 

All of that was to say - support your remote colleagues! Some of us are able to deliver substantially more remotely than we could ever dream in person. It makes the whole team stronger when people are able to work at their best"
"Also, WFH enables millions of workers to avoid commuting, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions materially. This alone makes WFH important for the planet. Given our current climate situation, this should be encouraged by governments e.g. for designated professions, and perhaps incentivized by commensurate corporate tax deductions."
Seriously. Its common sense. Remote work benefits both remote and on site workers.

I recently started a wfh job and this should extend the life of my paid off car that I was most likely going to have to replace by now. I'm super excited about that!
"i love WFH

I came into the office during the scam and it was my castle then all the effers came back so ""we can collaborate"", yeah nuts to that"
"I work on site, but I 100% support remote work for your reasons listed! Fewer people on site, and less traffic!"
What about those who are deemed essential in their duties that they need to be in office. What perks do they get besides hopefully less people on the train or road? While their remote counterparts save money and time as they work from home. I don't want to take that away from anyone but you also have to give perks for those who have to be onsite.
"I'm not super against the concept.

Went into the office everyday through Covid and it was a dream.
Almost no one there.
Traffic non existent.
Drivethrus were even dead at lunch. 

What was the horrible trade off I am still suffering today?

All the support depts that went WFH work at about 40% capacity and I can drive most every issue and inefficiency back to those groups.

These are groups that had to have a supervisor walk the floor to make sure they were engaged in their job of real time logistics and forecasting and not watching Netflix on their phone. 

Now they are at home. 
Hurts man."
"The people really against remote work, who are not executives or upper management, are corporate simps or it's because they cannot work remote no one should. Some companies just want control and to stare at you while you work. managers I have dealt with that cannot handle a remote team is because they need control in person and no they aren't necessary otherwise.

Some people do want to work in an office around people and that is fine. Some jobs cannot be remote and that is okay."
"While I prefer to work remotely, I am aware that there is someone willing and able to my job in the office for my salary. Clamoring for remote work doesn't make sense unless you are a unicorn to the company. Most people are not unicorns and are replaceable."
"You should speak to a doctor/mental professional about this. So that if you get another RTO call, you have medical proof for a reasonable accommodation ready. Doesn't always help, but it will in many cases.

When it comes to offer time for a job, I tell them I have a condition that I would either need a private office, or most companies opt for working remotely (with my doctor's backing). It's best to do it at the time of offer, as it is far harder for them to legally say no."
Sad to think they'd rather lose an excellent employee than allow remote work. I'm glad you've found a position in which you can thrive.
"This is also a great case for why remote work is accessible work. For people with various physical disabilities, neurodivergencies, and other challenges: remote work makes work accessible to all. 

Being in office basically says ""if you can walk, drive, see, hear, and mentally engage socially with a smile the whole time, you're welcome here!""

Everything about the office is designed for just a specific kind of person. Not for all people."
"Yes, with the widespread advent of remote work, the entire social contract must be revised."
I hear what you are saying. But wfh is not a perk in my view.
"This discusses the objections from individuals who are required (rather than choosing) to work in an office, aiming to emphasize how remote work benefits everyone, not just those working remotely."
"I ain't reading all that, but yeah remote work > office in every way."
My last off8ce job was the best job I ever had.  We had a great department and everybody was friendly.  We often would do things together.  WfH came into the picture in 2020 and it all went to shit.  Most of us retired.and keep in touch.  I had enough of the isolation and remote communication I retired at 67 at the end of the year.  Man I am so glad to have my home back for what I want.
"There are a few work from home opportunities that you can explore as a SAHM. You can try freelancing in your area of expertise like office administration or receptionist work. You can also explore virtual assistant jobs or customer service jobs that can be done from home. You can also consider online tutoring or teaching jobs as you have an Educational Assistant diploma.

Additionally, you can explore work from home job boards or websites like FlexJobs and Remote.co.

Best of luck in your search!"
Thank you for the great ideas and tip about remote work!
"I work for a large Fortune 500 company, and I can see the way my company implemented it soon becoming the standard for IT departments at non-tech companies.

We require all new hires for entry or just out of college positions to come into the office on a hybrid schedule (2 in, 3 wfh). This allows for the higher level of supervision and mentoring needed for people with a smaller amount of experience.

For more senior positions, there is no limit to where they can live, and is full wfh unless their primary residence is in a 60 mile radius from the office, in which case hybrid is expected. We have senior people who live all across the country, and the company pays us to come to the office for 3 days once every 3 months for PI planning.

Leadership positions (Director and up) can live anywhere, but are expected to fly into the office much more frequently. 

It is a solid setup, and works extremely well for all involved"
"WFH will probably grow once the economy/interest rates improve, and when demand for talent meets or exceeds supply. Right now, the market heavily favors employers, especially large corporations, since there are tons of qualified people who were laid off and are now looking for any decent job they can get.

My guess is that new businesses that are founded over the next 10 years will incorporate more remote work because it will save them money on office space, and enable an expanded talent search. And once demand for talent outpaces supply, WFH will function as a perk to hire  talented employees.

I don't really buy the idea that WFH is going to mostly disappear just because bosses want to feel like they have some power over their employees in an office setting, or because ""that's how it was before 2020."" People have now seen that remote work is viable for businesses and objectively improves employees' standard of living."
"The feds said they will cut interest rates down to 3% this year. Once that starts happening hiring will ramp up and companies will start fighting for talent again.

Remote work will continue to be a perk the best talent will expect and other companies will have to relent if they want to compete."
"Forever. 

I have been work from home or some hybrid/travel combo since 2005ish. It's not unique to the pandemic for tech and remote teams."
WFH will be the single biggest perk employers can offer. Once it becomes an employee market again companies will need to offer it to attract top talent. Once that happens the cycle will continue until larger companies stop renting and investing in large office buildings like fucking idiots
"It's not going away and will only become more common as connectivity and other technologies that enable remote work are developed. For example, AR glasses that have enough compute and battery to let you code from anywhere. Can't wait until I'm not longer tethered to my home office."
"Here is the thing. If your job is secure, move to LA and the savings in gas going to the office will add up, and if not, you get your money back in 20 years on reselling your home. However, in the interim, if you lose the job, that mortgage will be stiff at around, what is it, $9000 a month now? 


As for why WFH is not popular?
Billionaires own tech companies and diversify their wealth (old school trick) by owning both the office buildings and the housing units, often inside of REITs. WFH means empty apartments means lower rents means lower ROI which also means lower resale value. Empty office buildings means building values being slowly eroded on that front too, as growth stalls. Further, businesses around the building are owned by multi-millionaires and billionaires, such as chain restaurants and preschools/daycares. Their profits drop as well.

Finally, as WFH allows less car use, car values stabilize when other factors like recession and winter kick in, and no one wants to spend on vroom.

So, WFH rights will be something workers will need to demand."
"Trends I've noticed over the past couple of years

- Hybrid seems to be stabilizing at 3 in, 2 wfh
- fully remote is staying, but opportunities are more limited to timezone / geographical area around the office. 
- HR compliance with state tax / employment laws is ironclad, and not all states may be supported by a company
- companies / teams are working through how to mix remote and on-premise coworkers, either in same team or within same organization. Unlike during COVID when everyone was forced into remote there is now a big mix of how people can work, and where preferences lie.

Remote is never going to be as widespread as 2020-2021, but it probably won't stabilize for sure for a couple more years until hybrid can be fully evaluated, and full RTO at extremely large tech companies completes (succeeds or fails)

If I was in an org that is hasn't gone hybrid, or talked about it by now, I'd feel like it's stable, but that can also change if it gets bought out, goes under, or has a key leadership change in the board / C-suite

With the new year starting, seeing what kinds of companies are hiring, for what roles, and what they're open to should give us all more insight"
"I know a few things about the future of remote work. Been reading McKinsey blogs and studies since a few years.

The paradigm shift is already happening as many young employees were hired fully remote since 2020. This young workforce considers ""normal"" to work from anywhere and won't apply for in-office presence type of jobs.

Employers are already facing that fact combined with fewer candidates than ever.

Companies working fully remote since 2020 are now budgeting less travel cost from their employees and also less cost for their office space leases. 

This is a major reason why you should move where you want to live and not where you want to work.

The world has changed."
"In my country, for reasons i don't understand, remote work disappeared completely, only hybrid. 2022 still were a lot of remote jobs. Nowadays actually almost 0. I really hope that the remote trend will pick up again here.

Also hope that companies find a legal solution to let their people work from abroad (temporary, not relocation) if they choose. This mentality of limiting your freedom of movement in a digital age when all your job is happening online is ridiculous and just straight up sad. A company can only benefit from a happier worker."
"I think one aspect of this is the skillset that you have as well. It's an interesting finding of mine, and I can only speak for myself, but perhaps others feel this way as well...

I work from home, and I have done so since a bit before the pandemic, because I have a skillset now that gives me options. If a company I'm working for makes return to office demands, then that is their right to do so. I've worked hard over the years to be in a position to decline to return, because I can move on with not a great bit of difficulty. 

10 years ago, of course not that wouldn't work out well, because I didn't have a skillset that provided me with mobility, and more importantly, negotiating power."
"I have done remote work since the late 90's. 

I have done this by building a relationship with the company and as long as it is not an absolute requirement it works fine.

It's making it a requirement that creates problems. 

I have not worked further than a 20 minute commute from my home so it has never been an issue when being asked to come in."
"We are no longer hiring remote workers and current remote workers are being pressed to come back to the office. All pay raises are frozen for remote workers. As far as I can tell, the party is ending very quickly."
"I think remote work in tech will come to resemble the era of  outsourcing.  Jobs that are viewed as disposable, or rather, while there is a project, some portion will be farmed out to remote workers. 

The corporate or real carrier advancement stuff will occur in the office. It will probably take another 5 years to move back to something post covid, but that's what I see happening.  

The remote work fad is only 2 years old, and we are already second-guessing our covid shutdown response.  

Some jobs, like data, will  work well 5 serious work will be elsewhere."
Remote work is a scam just like unlimited PTO is
"It's already becoming less common, so I'd be careful making permanent decisions based on remote work unless you're set up to handle long periods of unemployment. It sucks but I think it's reality."
Never buy a house based on a job. Base it on where you want to live. Jobs will change. Remote work will continue
"There is one trend which shold be a concern for many remote workers. If the job can be done remote from the office, it can be done remote anywhere. Companies no longer need to keep jobs local to the office. It can easily be done somewhere with low lower pay.. ease of attracting employees, or offshore facilities."
The company I work for has made it clear they will never go back to required in the office time. Remote work is very much alive and stable in a lot of places!
"Yes, I've been working remotely since 2014. My original remote roles was so completely remote that I literally never even met my boss or most of my coworkers in all the years I worked there, and lived across the country from the office. It was less common then, but absolutely completely remote roles have existed for decades and will surely continue to do so. Not to the extent they did during Covid, but that shouldn't be surprising."
Who do the junior people learn from when the senior people are WFH?
"I think a lot of execs do actually struggle with fully remote work because they never bothered to learn to use tools like Slack, and they feel disconnected from the work because they don't understand that even when people are in the office they are using remote collab tools. They really do think things get done by serendipitous interactions in the halls and stuff"
"You bring up some good observations, but I disagree that remote work is ""never"" going to be as widespread as 2020-2021. I think growth in remote work will be fueled by new companies/startups, and over the next 10 years it wouldn't surprise me if a number of small operations become very successful while employing a primarily remote work force. This success will likely have little to do with remote work (talent is talent regardless of location), but it will show the world that highly profitable businesses can exist with an online white collar workforce. If this happens, old norms about management will change."
Remote work isn't really a fad.. people worked fully remote long before COVID happened.
I work for a very large global company. Pre pandemic I worked from home (my work is in another state) and during the pandemic all employees switched to work from home. They have now sold a number of offices and plan to stay remote. They feel they can attract better talent when they are not confined to just hiring in one area. I have coworkers all over the US and overseas .
"This sounds like it came from someone who has never worked with junior IT employees in an IT industry.

There is a ton of mentoring that has to happen with junior employees. Not just the IT reviews (code reviews, brainstorming, debugging, etc) but also the soft skills of working in a team and a corporate environment. Learning agile structure. Managing corporate relationships, etc. 

It is much easier to do so if you have a couple days a week of intensive, face-to-face time, plus the benefit of having a group of new hire in the same place (less repetitive questions, etc)

Its not a trust issue, primarily, though there is an element of that. Nothing wrong with having someone new to work in genereal showing they can be trusted in a hybrid role before being moved to full work from home, since new college hires will not have any kind of proven track record yet"
"Currently we have a number of Senior people who do come in on a Hybrid schedule. Plus, all management is required to as well. So there are generally people around to guide and mentor them.

I can see it becoming a problem if we hit a critical mass of senior people moving to WFH though."
"I do hope for more / staying remote, but structurally our way of life isn't built to reinforce it. 

- kids leave home to go to school, and spend most of the day there. Distance learning demonstrably set a *lot* of kids back a year or more
- most service / retail / manual labor jobs require in person presence
- interpersonal conflicts are more difficult to resolve virtually
- physical presence heavily influences received communication, as simple as a concert vs. a streaming song
- some parents / spouses *want* workspaces away from family for focus
- many people have living arrangements that don't allow for a home office (cramped apartments, roommates)"
"I don't think there is any data to support this hypothesis--remote works better in some jobs and sectors than others. 

I've also had a similar experience to the person you replied to where new startups want people in the office. They say it is to foster a more collaborative environment where you can quickly bounce ideas off each other and innovate quickly. I love working remote but they do have a point. For this reason I don't think the office will disappear just because some companies have been successful with remote. Every company is different."
"FAANG wants you back in office because they spent too much on offices and get too much in subsidies to go with what's logical.

But you can be working for a top 50 company and have them push WFH because they're saving money. It literally depends on what company and what they're trying to do. one of our competitors for example pushed RTO, but not because they need to, they just wanted an excuse on who to can and round 1 was based on who was outside of the 50 miles from an office criteria. a month later they came up with a 2nd excuse to can those who did go back to an office."
">There is a ton of mentoring that has to happen with junior employees. Not just the IT reviews (code reviews, brainstorming, debugging, etc) but also the soft skills of working in a team and a corporate environment. Learning agile structure. Managing corporate relationships, etc.

This is a major loss I see with WFM.  When I was coming up I was adopted by a group of older engineers and invited to join them for lunch.  Lunch pretty much consisted of them telling old war stories but in reality there was a lot of mentoring and guidance going on.  This was all unofficial but in hind site very important to my development and it only happened because we spent enough time in the office together and they liked me enough to join their lunch group.  Now 25 years later I'd love to mentor some young engineers but we've been WFH for 20 years and I have very little interaction with new/junior engineers.  I'm not going to randomly reach out to someone, that's not my job and I have no connection to these people.  So there will be a whole generation of engineers that will smart and competent will miss out on a lot of career and institution knowledge that can't be learned from a zoom call or a PDF.   This is a loss to the company and a loss to the junior workers, I'll be fine."
 It with the company I work for no. It has to be my primary residence and they check. Plus I'd have to drive 3.5 hours each way to get to the nearest city that would pay me at the level I made pre-move. They use a ranking system based on cost of labor instead of cost of living to determine what cities get what pay. I really wish more companies would just embrace WFH and pay their people the same across the board
"And if remote works better in some jobs, there's no reason to have an office.

Many of the non-office companies will rent a conference room at a hotel once or twice a year to meet in person.

You also apparently do not understand the word gradual.

This is a new idea, and you've never heard of this. Therefore, it's not going to happen. That's what your post boiks down to."
"Hmm, I think I worked for that very company for 20 years until I became one of the people RTO'd out of work.  They claimed it was ""my choice not to follow the work"" but I got severance and benefits under the involuntary separation rules.

This company owns vast acres of office space distributed around the country, but recently invested heavily in their headquarters to tune of $120 million just before the pandemic.  They are careful not to trip up on age discrimination, a task made easy with remote workers by the ADEA law passed in 1967 when remote work did not exist.  ADEA requires a statement showing ages and count for every location where an employee is laid off.   For remote employees, this age-ranked list at their location has a headcount of one."
"I have written about this extensively about this on Reddit. What you see on the media is an attempt to drive the narrative.

The facts don't lie. 

People are more productive at home. Employees are happier. It allows people to live in lower cost areas. Employers have a much larger pool of candidates and can negotiate lower salaries as a result. Startups with a remote workforce can perform better than businesses with an on-site model.

While employers are hoping to force the issue, it simply won't work -- unless they are willing to pay the difference. They will need to raise wages $9 an hour for the commute, and $14k a year for daycare. 

If employers really want to return to office, they need to reevaluate what a living wage means and adjust their salaries accordingly.

It's not an issue of employees being difficult or stubborn -- it's that many can't afford to return to office. It's not about convincing them with stupid propaganda like this.

No one with small children can afford an on-site office job and it doesn't matter how much you strong arm them. A $17 an hour job needs to pay $23 *just for childcare costs alone.* 

So when they try that shit, employees will quit because they can't afford the job. No one is going to work themselves into being homeless to stroke some executives need to have power and control.

The answer is simple -- either pay much higher wages ($15 an hour more if someone has children and commutes) or shut up about it. 

These assholes are literally expecting their employees to work some sort of miracle. Employees don't set the rental rates. Employees don't determine gas prices. The only people with the power to influence this situation are the employers.

All the bitching and moaning isn't going to change the fact that **workers can't afford to go into the office.** Until they address that, the conversation is over."
I have been working remotely even before the pandemic. It really depends on you to be honest. If you have good skills and are able to market yourself and are open to learning new stuff then you can always be working remotely.
No. The guardian has been putting out these biased articles about WFH for years. Plenty of other articles that are contrary to this one.
"The bubble has already burst. Execs have tried to push back, and employees are pushing right back. Very likely most roles will settle on a hybrid model, while some industries and companies will allow 100% remote work to attract the best talent. This is already happening, not much more will change. It's not rocket science, and all these articles are just bullshit."
"My employer intends to force people back to the office, even if it's just one day a week. They were honest and I made it clear that I would quit but that it would be an unfortunate outcome (they're a cool employer otherwise).

I worked at home as a contractor for a few years before the pandemic and I'd definitely consider that again if regular WFH employment becomes impossible. It paid less (I don't enjoy the hustle of finding work) but it was a great work/life balance. 

Basically, I have zero intention of ever returning to an office."
"Yes. Unfortunately the fear mongering is working and people are now scared of losing their jobs if they don't RTO at the will of their employer. Thanks to crony capitalism and the federal reserve hiking interest rates they are purposely trying to ""cool the job market"" aka make less jobs so people have less money to spend on inflated goods. Last job reporting in July was looking grim and this enables employers to be more choosey about who they keep and us WFH people scared we won't be able to land a new job if we give them the finger. Our movement is dramatically losing steam as of late and I don't see it improving. The mega wealthy in this country pull all of the strings to keep it that way"
"What I have noticed is that as demand grows for WFH the less companies are willing to pay hourly, and its getting to the point where if you WFH you may not be able to earn a livable wage.  I guess that's one way of saying to people, ok work from home but guess what we will pay you pennies on the dollar to do so, and that sucks."
"My company is remote (technically hybrid, but we live all over) except for a half a dozen who train people in-person.

Everyone I know who voluntarily works from home loves it. I don't ever plan on going back to an office.

My partner and I are both neurodivergent and WFH is perfect. if I remember I forgot to turn over the laundry, I can do it on my break, or I can literally roll out of bed and into my desk if that's what I need one day, and get changed and freshened up on lunch. Obviously we still put in our full hours, but a little flex bring SO much peace and order.

I'm saving money on my car, on clothes, dog daycamp, eating out for lunch, and probably so many other ways I haven't even realized yet.

I'm leaving to work at a friend's cottage for 3 weeks and my parents think I'm nuts. ""How can you work when people will want you to do things?"" By being grateful that when I'm done, I get to enjoy a cottage..."
Absolutely not. It's actually going to be a moderately paced transition to more remote work.  Very large companies may migrate the other way but small businesses with go the other much quicker.
I love working remotely.
"On top of what everyone else has spoken about, WFH means I am far more likely to do overtime as well. A couple hours on my day off but I don't have to leave? Why not."
"No way. I work for a company that makes a remote work app (Shameless promo: [https://tangle.app](https://tangle.app)) and the biggest trend I see in talking to customers is that aggressive RTO policies is making hiring for small and mid-sized companies a breeze. Engineers are turning down $100k+ in comp to stay remote and just for a smaller company. It's a *huge* perk that allows people to choose affordable, safe, comfortable places to live w/o sacrificing their careers. 

Now, you'll see a lot of article is WSJ, Forbes et al. about how work from home is dead because big companies have huge lease on massive amounts of real estate and they're desperate to get people back into those offices. Additionally, WFH is proving that significant amounts of middle managers are useless and those folks would love to have you back in an office where they can play boss and keep their jobs. 

I think what will emerge is that Apple, Google and places with big enough bureaucracies and reputations can force folks to RTO. But small + mid sized orgs will find WFH to be a major competitive advantage that they'll *need* in order to compete. It's also a big advantage to not have office/real estate overheads- All the better to pay y'all with :)"
"Working remotely is the market needs nowadays. If you are working well and have skills, then the company will allow you to 100% WFH. There are so many articles about dying wfh culture. However, this will never go. Employees and even employer are interested in WFH."
"I worked remotely for many years prior to the pandemic. It was a privilege first, a cost savings second, and a business continuity/disaster recovery practice third. People who worked from home were well trusted and exceptional salaried employees. 

Covid allowed the entry-level tier into this space - and many are and will become ""salaried exceptional employees."" However, this space is filled with horror stories of unvetted employees abusing the privilege. 

If you're in a high turnover low pay office job - expect remote work to be restricted. If you have a proven track record and have a number of years under your belt, your options will be much more open. 

Lastly - DON'T apply at local companies and expect remote work. I've worked remotely for two national service companies - my company's main office is states away. My boss is states away and also not in an office. It's by design that we have to work remotely. There's no other choice."
"Remote work has been around for decades. It's not a fad that started in 2019/2020. The only reason why companies are calling people back in is because they have to justify their need for a physical presence.

Some companies have wised up and realized that they could pass along the overhead savings to their customers and employees. The larger corporations, who've bought into the lie, are the ones drawing people back in. 

Most of them are slaves to their shareholders. They want to go back for the benefit of the shareholders, not the clients or employees."
"I ardently advocate for remote work as a fundamental aspect of societal evolution. Embracing this paradigm shift eliminates the necessity for traditional office spaces, reducing time spent in traffic and mitigating environmental pollution. By enabling individuals to work from any location of their choosing, we can foster a more equitable distribution of space and resources, ultimately enhancing overall well-being and happiness."
"Agreed - this whole subject led me to building an app that I've just launched called [Baandy](http://baandyapp.com/). It's the free answer to Airbnb and allows you to live in a place that's affordable and find people who live in cities and would like to swap homes for short or long periods. Not only is it something that I designed to help us get the most out of remote work, but also to fight back against the negative effects that platforms like AirBnB have on local + global rental markets. I'd love to hear what you think!"
"Me too! Long before the pandemic, I worked remotely for my employer for 8 years and LOVED it! It really suited me and I was far more productive/less distracted than my colleagues on site.  Am at another company now that is WFH. I'm never going back to physically working in an office."
"Yep I totally agree, what you say is absolutely spot on in my opinion. Remote working truly opens the doors to a world not dominated by city hubs that rob spaces of their culture and force people to become enslaved to a location in order to earn a living. I just launched my app [Baandy](https://www.baandyapp.com/)\- a home swapping app for zillennials who are suffering the consequences of a cost of living crisis and an increasingly unfair rental market. It's designed to allow users to real authentic travel experience that don't cost a penny from a travel accommodation POV. It's secure and safe, and fosters real connection. I'd love to know what you think as it sounds like we both share a similar view on the way things are headed and I believe this is the future of travel. Cheers and nice to meet you :)"
"Yeah sure, but they're either the kind that few people qualify for (high paying high skilled) or nobody wants (low pay menial service). There is not an oversupply of easy WFH six figures jobs requiring only a bachelor's."
"Well that might be true for newly qualified graduates, but I assume most people who moved to remote working during the pandemic are skilled and educated and good at their jobs.

If a person is lazy or completely new to work then they might have more trouble securing WFH . But companies can't run solely on newly qualified staff. They need to retain their more experienced staff too, which they will struggle to do if they try to force everyone back into the office. This benefits everyone, as there will tend to be company wide WFH policies."
">If a person is lazy or completely new to work then they might have more trouble securing WFH . But companies can't run solely on newly qualified staff.

The experienced people are the ones getting the cushy offers. There's an under supply of these people. The inexperienced unqualified people aren't getting these offers. There's an oversupply of these people. Simple as that."
"I would if it's close to my house and an easy commute. 

I just got so sick and tired of wasting up to 2-1/2 hours a day commuting.  But if the company is only like 15-20 minutes away I wouldn't mind going in. I'd still expect to have some level of WFH flexibility occasionally though."
"There may be a third option, with hybrid or remote work that also has some of the pay/benefits you're seeking. Maybe feeling torn means you should still keep looking as well."
$9 an hour is the difference between WFH and on site but may be more if you have a long commute. That comes out to be about $18k a year.
I say go for the larger salary to build a foundation for the move you make after that.  For $10k more it's not worth it but for anything over that you really have to consider going in to the office. Once you're in you may be able to work from home once in a while after 90 day probationary period.
U.S. health policy has dictated that in person work will never become reasonably safe for me again. There is not enough pay to be worth taking that trade if remote work is a viable option.
"Depends on what the career growth looks like. I've got a pretty well defined, lucrative and flexible path in front of me, so if the better paying job wouldn't put me on a similar path, nope! I'll keep my cushy home office until my next job change to another remote position at a much higher pay in the same industry. I stick around in positions usually just around the 2 year mark, so could very well get a similar increase in the next 1-2 years. 

To your scenario, I'd take it as long as your career doesn't stop right there, and as long as it's a competitive market rate. If you look at similar jobs elsewhere and they're paying way less, might be difficult to keep salary increasing as you move through the ranks."
"Personally no because I have a 125k WFH remote and don't need the extra $ at the moment so for me I wouldn't give that up to go on site.

Don't get me wrong I would entertain 150k WFH jobs but not on site. 

did that commute life for too long 10+ years"
"Remote work is the only work that doesn't make me feel like I have to go out to my car and cry. 
The money sounds really nice. I just say, if you can handle it, go for it. 
I don't think I would, I just can't go back to unnecessary work drama and bullying. 
And having everyone over my shoulder to nitpick and flex power."
See if they would let you work from home and pay less. They might take you up on it
">Searching for a remote job now. I found one that I'm totally perfect for. It pays 60k.  Was offered another job closer to what I like doing, tops out at 95k, pension bonus vacation all that jazz, but it's in an office.   I'm totally torn.  What would you do? I'd give up a lot to work from home but this might be too good to pass up.

**Don't forget the networking and consequently, growth, that comes out of going into an office.**

*Remote is incomparable*"
"Commute isn't bad. 20ish minutes of driving. If I ever needed to take a bus it's one bus. The office has a gym, but I'd have to pay for parking (I hate the bus so I don't mind this so much).  I just hold remote work very highly, so this is a tough one - but I'm also needing a job right now lol.   The one big thing is that this is a government job with pension and all that.  I may take this until I find a really good remote job I guess."
"No I totally get that. I've had that feeling of ""is this too much of a good thing?"" Or going too extreme with being so comfortable at home and never needing to leave the house if you don't have to.  So I get it.  Was doing WFH for just over 2 years and my home office isn't a place I can sit and have fun or do any hobbies cuz now I see it as a work space and associate it that way.  So you're not wrong in that having that in person connection counts for something.  Definitely something to consider."
"I mean, you have the best of both worlds.  I'd kill for a 125K WFH job.   You're set!"
"I'm a gen Z and I work remote since 3 years, networking is definitely harder doing remote work and I see a lot of the junior dev who are introverted being incapable of networking when not working in office.

It's not the case for everyone but I do think that office really benefits some people with less social abilities who doesn't have a lot of experience."
"While I agree this is probably an accurate description of the state of play now with remote work, I think it's very now-centric. 

I view this argument as being similar to saying in the early 1900s that horses are the way bc while cars have benefits, the roads are usually shit and horses can move on varied surfaces. 

Just like how road infrastructure unlocked cars, I same is happening with finding ways for informal interactions / relationship development in remote settings."
"The constant begging for easy to get jobs is getting annoying. As if there are mythical easy jobs out there. I had to study and work hard for my current remote work position. It is a specialistic work field and my 20 years of experience gave my employers the confidence to actually let me work worldwide in other countries. 

Want an actual well paying job with good perks? Then step your game up and work for it instead of asking for it on reddit."
"Even if you do have a degree and experience, most jobs will not allow you to care for an infant or toddler while working. Where remote work DOES have an advantage is if you have older kids who can't stay home alone, but are in school all day and old enough to keep themselves occupied for a couple hours in the afternoon. That can save the cost of after school care. 

My own job is more flexible than a call center, but still with some boundaries. We work 9-5 with an hour lunch. But no one cares if you occasionally log in a few minutes late or take an extra 5 minutes for lunch. Doing laundry/walking the dog/taking little breaks during the day is fine. Disappearing for long stretches of time is not."
"I work from home . I have a set schedule, set breaks and lunches.

Always amazed when people assume because I work from home I can just show up when I want to."
"Just to throw my 2 cents about remote work and a few thoughts in general.
1. There is no unicorn entry level job. $100k, fully remote, set your own hours, travel the world, etc etc. Most entry level remote work stinks, other than being remote. Call center type work/phone work. Hard set hours/breaks scheduled etc. To get the ""easier"" or more flexible jobs, you either have to have the experience (years not months) or work in a field that allows it. Those fields usually require formal training, software/engineering etc.
2. Work ethic. Don't assume it always means selling your soul to the company/working 90 hours a week etc. Work ethic is also where people can rely on you to get your work done efficiently, correctly and reliably. Nothing makes you more valuable when no one has to remind you about something. 
3. New companies will (usually) pay more than your current job will do as a raise. Use LinkedIn and occasionally update it with work only stuff. React to posts etc. Recruiters will reach out to you. However, don't jump jobs just for jumping jobs. To get some of the perks, remote etc, you have to stay somewhere for a bit. 
4. One field people tend to avoid is sales. Whenever someone hears sales, they think car sales type dynamic. Most higher end sales roles are more account manager type. Relationship building. Product knowledge etc. Find a niche and run with it. This is what I do. Im fully remote. Covering a territory. 6+ hour drive from the office. I have as much freedom as I want but it is always driven by the numbers."
"Thank you for posting this! I have seen so many misconceptions about what working from home means, as well as it means to be salaried. I wfh and am salaried (no OT) and I have to work a minimum of 40hours a week and I have to work at least 8 hours a day within core hours of 8am-6pm. I have seen so many posts where ppl seem to think if you are salaried you don't have to work 8 hours a day and that wfh is this glorious free for all. It's anything but!!"
"this thread needs to be a sticky. 

ill never understand how people seem to think wfh means work from anywhere in the world like they're  above everything, then whine they get told no.."
"I am fully remote with flexibility. 

I guess you can describe my work situation as a long-term gig worker. I have specific skills and experience - let's say I design and animate infographic videos that help communicate complex medical research information in a manner that's more understandable for a general audience.

Compensation-wise, I get contracted to work on a project for 5 months, which offers a project rate for everything I'm agreeing to complete and be accountable for. To ensure that I fulfill my commitments, my payments are split up based in milestone deliverables. So I get an advance to get started And then I essentially aim to complete work that generally gets me paid monthly.

My situation is flexible because nobody is watching my hours or when I work. I can work whenever suits me, as long as I complete deliverables according to a general timeline. If I'm able to find ways to get my work done faster and maintain quality of work, I still get paid the same.

I'm not slacking, however. I care about the work so I have internal motivation to do good work. And it's partly why I have the working relationship that provides me this remote work opportunity.

I have check ins with a team, so i accommodate for meeting times with others who work in different parts of North America. It's easy to coordinate when you have such flexibility. 

Yes. The gig projects can disappear any time, so I don't necessarily have ongoing stability, but one of these gigs pays for my living for a year, and It's been the best work/life balance I have ever experienced."
"I totally get what you're saying about remote work. It's not always as flexible or easy as some hope. I've been there too. It's essential to set realistic expectations. Some remote jobs are great, but many require degrees and experience. If you're seeking flexibility, it might take time to find the right fit."
"I think there are 3 viable circumstances in which companies will more readily accept remote work today.

1. STANDARDIZED JOBS WITH ACCESSIBLE PROCESSES AND PROTOCOLS: The work is repetitive, is a repeat need, or has lots of accessible rules or scripts. Such as online customer service (constant need), or retouching of event photos (ongoing production). As long as the work is delivered, remote work won't get questioned.

2. ONGOING PROOF OF SUCCESS: Experienced workers who have earned the trust for fulfilling their duties and meeting accountabilities. This works when bosses see proof of success regularly, so the remote worker always has to prove this and ensure bosses never have fear, uncertainty, or doubts about their remote working status impacting success.

3. NICHE/RARE SKILL SETS: the skills or experience they need for project fulfilment are so specialized that they need to be open to a distributed work force to access these skilled workers.

Basically OP already touched upon these but I like to make listicles! Thanks for coming to this Ted Talk."
"Not true. At least, not true for me.

My remote work meets all those requirements. 

Some days I don't even get out of my pajamas. Some days I don't even wear pajamas LOL. I do whatever I want whenever I want and as long as I meet my deadlines, I'm good. I can go anywhere on a whim, I am literally free to choose. I was making $8k/mo at the highest, but cut back last year because I wanted to work less. It's slower now, and I like the extra time. I don't have kids, but I have 2 dogs I take care of and we do whatever we want.

Part of getting a good remote gig is focusing on what you want and realizing you can get exactly what you want. I'm in the process of leveling up in my niche, but there are people less skilled than me making as much and more than me doing the same thing with the same freedom. (Copywriting). No degree needed. If you can write well and are reliable, you can get paid for it."
"I had 20 years of experience in my field before I joined my current company. This was in 2015 and they were already fully remote. That is not why I took the job. It was just a feature of a role that made sense for me in my career progression.

I was an individual contributor but joined management a year ago. In both situations this is *not* a job that can be done while caring for children. We work with clients around the globe so you can be required to be in meetings at odd times. Though not a regular thing I have worked until 11 at night and on weekends. But I also have the flexibility to take my dog to the park or take a long lunch without clock watching. I can also work from anywhere but having to take client calls while on vacation in Europe sucked. Flexibility is a two sided thing - your employer can be flexible with your needs but they will expect the same. 

Also education didn't matter but experience did. My company won't hire entry level folks. If you have no experience doing the kind of work places are looking for it's ridiculous to think you can ""move into remote work."""
"I see these kinds of posts on here and honestly I just pass them over. 

My position is flexible in that I can login within reason of my scheduled hours but still need to do my 8 hours. Every other week I'm on at 630 because I need to get reports out for the teams. 

Easy? No. I have extensive experience and knowledge. You cannot walk in off the street and do my job despite what many may think. 

I do teach a college class on the side. My old employer contacted me and asked me if I was interested in teaching a class and I said yes. I do so before and after my working hours. 

I definitely don't travel. Yes, technically they sell masking vpn but since I'm one of the folks that tell others they cannot and I'm not a hypocrite I work from home. 

I do take care of my grands occasionally as needed but not daily."
"Remote work is really easy to find, it just depends on your area of expertise. If you're trying to be a surgeon and do it remotely, you're going to have a tough road ahead of you. But sales, engineering, customer service, legal, HR, and finance are all readily available. For those who can't find remote roles, you're not looking correctly. For those who can't find a role to fit their expertise, that's another story."
"I wouldn't say it's rarely what you think it is. That seems to have just been your experience. I think it really just depends if people know what they're looking for. In some separate bullet points this is just my experience to highlight what it's like, using yours as a template:

&#x200B;

* Flexibility - The hours are semi flexible. I work Sunday - Thursday. If I wanted to temporarily work Friday instead of Monday, I could make the request. If I need to leave early, I could, with the exception that I work an equivalent amount of hours lost another day. I can't work as long as I want though, I'm restricted to 40 a week (which is fine). but I can take my breaks whenever. I have the choice to not take my lunch and get off work an hour early. I don't take my lunches because I don't need to but they aren't as long as I want. (You could probably cheat around this but eh, why would I. The job is fine)
* Travel - We *could* work anywhere and travel if you want to lug around a computer with you, but if you know how to use computer well and set up your own VPNs to connect to your home net, you could do this easily.
* Caring for Children - Really depends on what you're doing but the majority of employees where I work are composed of young mothers and it's allowing them to care for their kids. My sister has 2 kids and works here.
* Pay and Difficulty - It's the easiest job I've ever had. I'm not kidding here. It's almost criminal compared to the shit I had to do making $8.25 as a cashier in a shit grocery store back in 2017. On some days literally nothing happens. My partner and I both work here and we just do things around the house. One of the head managers even mentioned that they wanted the job to feel like we're stealing a paycheck. This pays $50k salary. That's not much in some high cost areas but it's good for me and for the amount of work you're doing, this essentially feels like you're getting unemployment checks. We're using this time to learn python and gain other valuable skills. However there are uptimes where things do get busy. The job can get difficult but more in a mental sense. Despite that, I can still juggle while I work. Task are done at my leisure so long as it's not past an 8 hour SLA.
* Simultaneous jobs - I could double my income if I could actually get an offer. but to be fair I haven't been sending much applications out. I'm not constantly taking calls and as I mentioned, work is at my pace So i could fit another part time or even full time job depending on the requirements. Tons of people that work here already do this. Part of me wants to maximize my earnings, the other part of me just wants a break. Between all the school, previous shit jobs and life troubles. It's nice to just worry about one job and put all my focus into learning new skills so that I could get an even more lucrative remote job or lounging about and relaxing all day. I don't care if I lose the free time. (It would definitely be missed) but its nice to have a breather AND a safety net where you can actually take the time to learn and improve myself.

I think it really depends on what someone is looking for in remote work. For some background, I work in IT. Been in this position for over 2 years. I don't have a degree in this, but Graphic Design. My experience with tech is self learned.. I have no certs, or anything, but what helped is probably the fact that I worked as a Sys Admin/Level 2 Tech the job prior but most of the skills required are entry level.. This position came to me as a random indeed email asking if I'd be interested in this position and I said yes. A recruiter called me next day, told me about it. Thought it was a scam but played along to see if the typical red flags would show but never did. Once they sent me expensive equipment and send the tax paperwork and such, I knew it was real and here I am. Remote can come in many forms, but it can be exactly what you think it is if you know what to search for and what your expectations will be.

Despite all this though I would never abuse the job. Like I wouldn't work-travel all the time, or hang out with friends while I work, etc."
I have all of those bullet points and have one more year until I get my degree. Remote work is incredible.
"What company? I work from home but would kill to have a 4 day work week and log in whenever I want.

There are a lot of nights I just can't sleep, and would kill to be able to bust a few hours of work out rather than wake up early and do it after not getting enough rest."
"Sorry if it's been a buzz kill. Just trying to get facts to folks who don't know what it's like. There are some unicorn wfh jobs, read all the comments and you'll see a few."
"I won't disagree 100%. I have been working remote for better than 25 years with different companies. Each had their own pros and cons. I occasionally had to take a non-remote position for a few months at a time, but I always kept applying for new wfh jobs; because of my history of working remotely, I never had to wait very long for an acceptable offer."
"I was onboard with you until this turned into a condescending and patronizing rant against young adults for literally no reason. Infantilizing adults by referring them to ""kids"" is honestly one of my biggest pet peeves and I find it nauseating. I haven't seen any indicators of age in most of the posts you are referring to. Maybe your bias is causing you to assume that's the case. 

A lot of people are desperate for jobs right now and there are a lot of reasons that people are looking to work from home. 

It's impossible to find childcare where I live right now and a lot of people who previously worked in places like factories are now desperately trying to find remote work and are taking massive pay cuts in most cases."
"What I said is a load of crap, oh, except for this part you agree with:

> I agree 'working hard' doesn't always work 

Oh, and this other bit you agree with:

>except in some very specific fields and roles

I can also assure you I haven't given up. As a blind person, giving up would have been a viable option, one I didn't take. Work hard, but please, don't ignore office politics. 

I currently work from home, 40 hours per week in the UK. But I still want more out of life, so I'm working hard to go get it."
"Exactly. Employees are starving for non-tech, varied WFH."
"I do recruiting and hiring for our 1099 and never just post.  Problem with that isn't hiding anything, it's that most people are afraid of things they don't know when in actuality most people who try things outside their normal comfort zone.

My recruiting first call is covering all the stuff they probably don't want to know but in a way that lets them ask questions.

It's a big world, some people (like me) can't stand a 9-5 office job and some love it.  I'm after people who are looking for 100% WFH, hard workers and aren't afraid to talk to other humans.  Sales, but no cold prospecting."
"I work in tech and do consulting and we will offer talent whatever option they want, W2, c2c, full time, contract what have you.

I'll even let someone use our legal department to setup an llc.or S Corp if they want to forgo our benefits and c2c for some reason. We keep contracts in that case very bare bones. Otherwise, it might seem a conflict of interest.

There is nothing wrong with wfh, I actually prefer it with developers and some creative. But at the end of the day, people either do their job or don't whether they are at home or office. We have tightened up what our metrics are, and make the teams hold each other accountable. If other members on your team want you gone, we make it happen pretty fast if justifiable."
I work in higher education as a research administrator. It's a niche job that all research universities need so seems to be a trend to allow remote work in this field.
"Literally, no one knows what I do, or how I do it. So, I have a unique situation that is complex enough where people turn to me for expertise in tough situations that may cost the company lots of money, and I can usually make the cost go away. They don't ask too many questions about it. I work about 2 hours a day most days, but when things go haywire, I might be doing some long days. But, I am paid really well for this. And I don't really have to go into the office since I live out of state. Occasionally, they call me in for some stupid dog and pony show, but it's a small price to pay to be able to work from home and not have to act busy all day in an office."
"""Mechanical Department Head""

The trick with finding remote work is excelling in a career and proving your reliability to the point where your boss would rather let you work remotely than leave you.

Hunting for random jobs because you want to work remotely isn't a very good way to do it."
"Senior Accountant 


We don't designate remote work by job title but most of our office jobs are remote."
Healthcare. Lots of options for remote work at my place of employment
"Project Manager in EdTech. Go look for EdTech companies as there are an abundance of WFH options in customer service, scheduling, HR, finance, IT, etc."
"I'm a Principal Cybersecurity Governance and Compliance specialist. My main area of focus (80%) is cybersecurity policy (writing, updating) but I also do compliance stuff, risk assessments, training. I left the techy part of cyber over 10 years ago when I worked my way into the oversight/governance part. I like it a lot better. I work for a public utility and 100% wfh. My current salary is $161k.

"In general if your can do your work from a pc or over the phone, it has the possiblity of remote, but ever company is different. Call centers and IT are more WFH friendly mainly because they have been doing it so long"

Can you adopt work from home because I have made a lot of money in the last few months through social mining
"i wanted to work from home when the pandemic began, since 2020 i've had three different entry-level remote customer service jobs (2 were seasonal, and 1 just didn't work out after the schedule I was told during my interview turned out to be nothing like the schedule they kept giving me once hired) and I found one of those jobs on Indeed, the other two on this website a friend told me about called [www.ratracerebellion.com](https://www.ratracerebellion.com). That site has tons of listed remote job postings!"
Hmm when I just used their job finder I put work from home and remote as search terms and didn't yield any available jobs.
Which location? Cause we have hubs in Tampa Richmond and last Vegas that all post listings but they are remote work from anywhere besides Hawaii and California
"I have a subscription right now you can pay $2 or something for 14 days. For me, I've been applying non stop. Reference: (I have my associates degree and two other work from home job experiences on my resume, along with a receptionist job) I haven't been getting any hits. I've probably applied to 30 jobs in the last two weeks and still nothing. I'd say it's still worth a try though. Your experience may be different. Yes they are all legit jobs. But there are some pyramid schemes on there... id stay away from any contract work or look up the rating on indeed/Glassdoor of those."
"Work from home, it's a call center based program, working as support for a multitude of companies."
"Not to be offensive to you personally, but where does the idiotic idea that people who work from home don't shower, get dressed, or leave the house come from? I'm so sick of hearing this rhetoric as if remote workers are working in a dungeon in the basement or something with no other human contact."
Meh there won't be a remote work sub because in 50 years the remote work jobs will be AI. Problem solved.
"Remote work in 2075 might seem like a dream with its flexibility, but the dystopian reality is lurking. As corporations tighten their grip, remote workers face an Orwellian future. Imagine waking up to a digital overseer, tracking your every move. Being late, even by a minute, results in demerits. Want to text your mom? Better check your 'Meta Score' first.

  
To avoid becoming a mindless drone, we must demand transparency and accountability from corporations. Push for regulations that protect workers' rights and privacy. Embrace unions and collective bargaining to ensure fair treatment. Let's not trade our freedom for convenience."
I leave my house more when I work from home than when I had to go into the office because I'm not drained from a 1.5 hour commute back home
Don't be a stick in the mud it's a joke about dystopian society and remote work in the future
lol I shower significantly less since wfh
"If you don't know that this is the image many people really have, you must live under a rock. A politician in the US recently called wfh'ers loser incels or something along those lines.

Funny thing is that a lot of people who wfh almost surely have fuller lives than those who wfo. Enjoy your fluorescent lit office with Ted who steals your lunch from the fridge while others are soaking up the sun and vibes from Bali."
"I'm 100% convinced that ""hybrid"" is corporate speak for ""we know we can't force people in full-time yet, so we're going to slowly walk them back in"". After two years of successfully working remotely, it's an absolute joke. These corporate leaders are pathetic.

That said, there are many companies offering 100% remove. Don't hesitate to walk away from your employer and let them know the reason on the way out."
"OP I'm in the same position. I decided to start looking for a fully remote position. Our jobs can absolutely be done remotely so there is no legitimate need for us to be in the office. That's what kills me, especially with gas prices being as high as they are now. I would say it's time to start looking for another job where you can work from home every day. Would you really be happy moving forward if you stayed?"
"My work has been tried to implement this hybrid model (2 -3 days in office, the rest at home). Due to the different variants of covid19 and their corresponding surges, each return to work has been cancelled. At this time, we know we will never return to a 5 day work week but not sure if they will attempt the hybrid model again.

That being said, if/when they do implement the hybrid model - I may start looking as well. Life is too short to hate your job. I worked remote before the pandemic so it's always been my preferred type of work. And the pandemic created SO MANY remote jobs!!! Perhaps you could give them opportunity to keep you. If you get an offer with another company, before you accept the offer you could let your current company know your plans and give them the opportunity to keep you as a fully remote person. If they can't meet that requirement, then leave and don't feel bad - you gave them a chance before leaving for greener pastures.

I've only worked remote for this company during the time I've been there because of the pandemic. Commuting sucks, I'm more productive at home and I don't like the location of the company's physical building. The office is in a dangerous part of the  city. One of the mass shootings in the news this year was very very very very very very close to the building. I can't see myself feeling comfortable working in this area until 5:00pm or later, since we regularly work 10-12 hour days from home. Quite honestly, I get much more done than when I work from home. I have fun in the office when everyone is there for sure but I am SO less productive! And not to mention - it is so much more exhausting! LOL

I go to the office on an as-needed basis, like a couple times a month. I pick my days to go in based on my work load and I leave whenever I feel like it (I dont stay a full 8 hours and will resume working once I'm home). I often run to/from my car to the front door of the office when I go in. I've already been followed to my car by a sketchy crackhead (whom proceeded to knock on my window and wave at me after I jumped in my car to get away from him) and dodged drug dealers and mentally ill people pissing on the sidewalk in front of our exit door. Yes, one day I was about to fling open the exit door and run to my car like usual and I see someones ass. A homeless drug addict had decided to back their butt up to our exit door and do their business. Literally, I had to wait for them to finish and pull up their pants before I could open the exit door, and leap over their puddle of piss before I did my normal anxiety jog/fear speedwalk to my car.

I'm fine with visiting the office as-needed once a week/couple times of month and special events but anything more than that will make me bounce for sure."
"Here's the thing that a lot of employers and employees dont realize: Companies need us workers more than we nees them. Without our services, they cant thrive. If we quit, it'll cost them more $$$ in recruiting, training and retaining potentially new employees. Granted, it does work both ways but if you're experienced in your field, the odds are you'll be avle to negotiate WFH with a potential new employer that has an opening available opposed to a stuffy old employer that believes they're doingnus a favor.

Corporate America needs to wake up. The pandemic gave us something we didn't have before :FLEXIBILITY. Its frustrating that so many employees fell in line when they were told to go back. So it's up to us, especially those of us w young kids whos school day ends @3, to change the status quo.

I just read an article abt the CEO of Goldman Sach wants all employees to go back 5 days a week. He cited saying that being together creates collaboration which leads to better business. That's bullshit. Companies like GS had record profit margins during the pandemic. In that same article, it stated that many employees are leaving for tech firms that promote and embrace WFH. THIS IS WHAT WE ALL NEED TO DO

As for me, I went thru thru the proper channels to request a permanent WFH which was denied. I haven't gone into the office yet but i do plan on playing nice until a full remote opportunity comes abt (which I'm currently working on). The company i work for showed me how much they value me, which is to say not at all. Its up to me to look out for me and my family."
Im in the same boat and shopping my resume around for remote work. There are employers that are offering this and these are the employers that will WIN. not just win but WIN BIGLY
"Yep, time to brush up the resume and look for a remote job.

Have you asked if you can stay remote? They may be willing to negotiate, depending on the situation (my husband negotiated permanent WFH this way).

Remember to factor in commuting time when evaluating salaries - if you're commuting an hour each way, that's a 10-hour workday, plus gas and vehicle expenses. A smaller salary WFH often ends up making you more than the larger in-office, and that's not even considering the lifestyle benefits..."
I miss the Coffee Room. A lot of interesting stuff came up in random conversations in or around the coffee room. Personal interaction is a missing element in remote work.
"Significantly exacerbated the part of me that is anti-social, and it's not a good thing.

Basically, hanging out with people takes significantly more effort than it ever did. There was great convenience in meeting in town after work for happy hour or dinner, etc. It's a lot harder to muster the drive to make plans to go do something in the city on week nights.

I live in a big city and its energy is contagious, even for productivity. But now that I'm home all the time I experience much less of that energy.

WFH is good but make no mistake, it's a tradeoff for many of us."
"I won't say loneliness, because I have life long friends that I don't work with. I won't say spending too much money on food because I have a kitchen full of stuff to cook right down the hallway from my home office. I guess the worst thing about working remote for me is that I forget to shower for a day or two longer than I normally would. When I am going to leave the house, I almost always shower before doing that. If I don't leave the house, I might not shower for up to 2 days. If I don't leave the house for a week or more? Well, you can guess how that would lead to potentially being a little more grody than usual."
"Nothing .  This post might as well
Be titled what I hate about life/living

The example OP gave isn't really related to remote work specifically cause they would do the same thing if in the office (take out delivery) or retired.  OP just doesn't like to cook or think about what to eat, no matter what the case."
"There's only one thing I hate about remote work: employers frowning upon it and seeing it as a concession they're forced to grant, rather than a great innovation and something good for employee engagement and business."
"[https://imgur.com/a/O8Uh0tX](https://imgur.com/a/O8Uh0tX). when i moved intestate with approval to work remotely i ordered this, one half for me the other for my wife with a door in between. we dont open the door without checking first and i absolutely love it, after 4 months i have yet to experience a negative about working remotely"
"LOL. You speak the truth. I can fully relate to this. 100% of our food bag clips are binder clips from the office. During WFH, I had to make do with those shitty food clips they sell at grocery stores. Office acquired binder clips are legit the best food storage clips. 

As soon as my office forced me back 3 days a week, I pocketed a bunch of 1 inch binder clips, tape (holiday presents), notepads (grocery lists) and Sharpies. Our office buys cheap leaky pens, so I didn't steal those."

Leaving the restaurant industry after 13 years is a big and brave move! It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of online job options, especially with the prevalence of scams. But worry not, there are plenty of legitimate remote work opportunities out there, and your skills and experience are valuable"
"What is a SaaS company?
 Also looking for remote work"
"The truth is online jobs can be riddled with scams, and scammers understand how much people want to work from home. They impersonate employers and hiring managers in order to obtain personal financial information from job seekers. Make no mistake, anyone can become a victim of fraud. The Internet is not even completely secure against interception. As a result, no one can guarantee its absolute security. As a result, it is critical to be cautious on the internet and be aware of all warning signs in order to avoid being scammed."
"I will be the bearer of bad news. 

You most likely will not find the type of work you're looking for. There are far too many people with education/experience that are already working remotely. There are little to no ""entry level"" positions that aren't some sort of scam because remote work for employers takes trust in responsibility and entry level/no experience/no education people aren't generally suited. 

I think you should rethink what it is you're trying to do. 
Millions and millions of ""autistic and disabled"" people have been working for decades long before remote work even existed. 

Good luck to you."
"I don't have anything specific, but Idealist lets you sort by remote work, education, and experience level. When I just filtered by what you mentioned in your post ~50 results came up. It's not a ton, but take a look and see if any would be a good fit and use that as a starting point."
"You change job

Before you do so you could try to negotiate remote work as a perk due to w/e reason and get it in your contract, but from the sound of it that is not going to be an option, so you should change job."
"""the President of the parent company wants our branch to end remote work because he thinks people will work better when they exchange ideas in person""

This seems to be a common message executives are trying to push. Any ideas you can exchange in person you can also do via phone calls or zoom meetings with screen share. We've proven that throughout the pandemic. 

I'd point out that it's a bit unfair for them to expect you to return while everyone else remains remote, and also mention the productivity boost, but I personally have no problems with pushing back on such things. Definitely continue to job hunt though."
"Sorry, this is tough for you. 

You can try to get a new offer somewhere else, and then ask your current employer whether they would like you to stay as a remote worker or leave.

That's assuming that you would want to stay. This current job sounds like a poor work environment due to that manager's general inability to manage, and a culture that allows that to go on for an extended time. 

Some people have pointed out that the job market isn't doing well at the moment, but it seems to be dependent on industry. Some industries are laying off left and right, while others are still desperate for skilled people. I hope that you're in the latter, or at least in an industry that's functioning normally at the moment.

Good luck to you. Most workplaces are staffed with fairly decent, mostly competent people, and you should definitely be able to find a new workplace that treats you with respect. And in turn, that will reduce the amount of stress in your life. This current situation sounds pretty stressful."
"Move out of state lol. That's the only way you have leverage. My company SOLD buildings and committed to remote work, and now we're being forced to share seating in 1 building.

Mofos who were remote, even pre covid. If they lived near the office, they are being changed to hybrid without their consent. All the people who left during covid will continue to be remote and it sucks man

I bought a house just now out of state and HR STILL told me I am still expected to come in twice a week every week. Even if I offered to fly in every other week, they still said I HAD to be in every week. I just started applying to other jobs"
"It might be helpful to have a friendly and straightforward conversation with your boss about your desire to continue working remotely. You can explain how remote work has been beneficial for you and your productivity. It's also important to express any concerns you have about the potential change in your work arrangement. By approaching the conversation with honesty and respect, you can work together to find a solution that works for both you and your employer."
"Either quit or RTO. If a company doesn't have a profitable quarter, remote work is usually the first thing to go. It's really never a permanent thing."
"I had a decent boss previously, and worked great with my super small team remotely. There was no reason for us to come in. We were an overstressed and overworked team, not having to go into the office helped a ton. They made a effort to try to get everyone back into the office on this random day. I figured Id give it a shot, see some people I haven't seen in person in a while so I went. I get there and tried to be open minded. No one in any team that I collaborated with was there. My boss who was hired during covid was tied up in meetings all day. One dude multiple cubes to my left was blabbing away on the phone super loud. It was a ghost town. I was way less productive (my home office was way better equipped as well).

Went back home and worked remotely again after that. Made my grievances known to my boss. Next time leadership pushed for in office I handed in my notice. Remote was the first thing they offered back to try to retain me. If I had turned in my notice earlier I would have said yes but I was so fried I said I'm done and took a break from work with the goal of going on a vacation or something. Only thing I would have done better is line up another gig first then give my notice. 

Don't be afraid to jump ship, it sounds like you got the right idea of lining up your next gig first then jumping. If you really want to stay you could use the new gig as a bargaining chip but I have no idea how worthwhile that is cause they may end up getting rid of you down the road and then you're out of luck."
"People are productive, but it takes different management styles, and old school managers leading companies are uncomfortable with change. The only way they'll get the collaboration they envision in the office is to go back to having one single office in one city for every employee. Today's world is remote work, either sitting at home or in the office."
"Most peoples work is not remote, and most remote workers are not successful as remote workers."
"If it's what you want, in totality, go for it. If you're just doing it for the money you have options, including looking for a new job, asking for a raise at your current job, and moonlighting with a second pet time job or starting a business.

From what I've seen, a lot of younger people, including me when I was younger, think that the only way to more money is harder work and drinking the kool-aid. If you're doing good and valuable work, and people like you, you might be able to get a smaller raise and still keep the WFH perks. Doesn't hurt to ask.

If I went back four days a week, it would mean a return to coming home and immediately cooking, cleaning, and fixing stuff for several hours til I'm exhausted every night. I'm happy being able to use my (unneeded) commute time and lunch break to exercise and take care of chores, so I can enjoy life outside of work. I'd personally not be willing to make that trade unless the money was really good (as in, I could retire ten years earlier good)."
"I was lucky enough to negotiate it for my current job. But I do also live in the same city in case I had to go in (haven't since the first week) and was fortunate my supervisor is a fan of WFH even though he's hybrid

That was also last year and the job market seemed very employee friendly.

Either way, no harm in applying (unless the job description explicitly states hybrid/on-site it's very likely not negotiable). When you get an email from the recruiter asking for an interview, ask if the role is possible to be remote. They say yes, you continue the interview process. They say no, onto the next one"
"Where I'm from it's hard to negotiate a hybrid schedule even if official company policy says it is an option and you also have it in your contract. 

Seriously, some managers are redacted when it comes to work from home."
">They'll go with the candidate who has 0 issue going in office.

Provided they find said person who mr(s) right. After filtering out the drove of applicants, they had to do something impressive to be shortlisted, and considering the fact WFH is desirable said list can just get even shorter, more lackluster...... their a reason Job posted as remote are getting more then half the Job seekers out their."
"Almost impossible I'd say, most western companies will not employ someone remotely overseas, and the tide is turning against remote work. Most companies are mandating a return to office with a hybrid model."
There will always be remote work. But doesn't mean it'll always be plentiful. You have to fight for it if you want it. And that means upskilling yourself and lots of networking. You want to connect with other professionals who work for fully remote companies.
"It is entirely industry dependent and how that company is doing financially. Lot of these RTO mandates are to soft layoff people in that they'll leave on their own. In a year or two half those companies will be fully hybrid or remote. Seems like some sort of hybrid is gonna be the medium. The RTO push should finally die after the new year. Talk to your friends, family, neighbors, etc. Most still have some semblance of remote work, and these articles are all just narrative pushing bullshit."
"I'm starting to see articles about shareholders demanding to know why companies are clinging to offices when wfh is clearly more productive and less expensive. If you have investments, 401k, start voting your shares..."
"When employers went remote during the pandemic, they generally intended the arrangement to be temporary. Workers wanted to believe WFH would be permanent. While many of them reported a spike in their productivity and  improved satisfaction, there was no shortage of bad apples ruining it for everyone. (Plus a number of other factors, of course.)

At this point, I believe employers have recaptured the power. They're just waiting to see what happens in 2024 before deciding how to proceed. Certainly more layoffs can be expected in the new year."
"I work for a tiny company (there's 6 of us) and we're never, ever going to a brick and mortar. The company was founded on WFH and we're growing as a WFH operation."
"Firstly, alot of those are based on job postings, rather than actual positions (it's easy to measure job postings).      The problem with postings is that they measure churn or turnover. Remote positions have a better retention rate so aren't turning over as much as other positions.  Don't conflate job postings with jobs.  

As others have said, yes, many companies are moving towards a hybrid model, and potentially reducing fully remote positions.

Best source of remote data I've found is WFH Research who does a monthly survey. They're finding about 12% of all working remotely, and that goes upto 19% when you look at only positions which are remote capable (remove people that can't possibly work remotely).   Hybrid is about 30/47.9%.   [https://wfhresearch.com/](https://wfhresearch.com/)"
"I have been remote since the pandemic, only going into the office as necessary which averages out to something like 4 days per month. I am pretty certain that one of the primary reasons my company has allowed so many of us to WFH is because our facility is currently under major construction so office space is limited. I've always had an office but now I am shoved into an area with five other people, no cubicles. I recently had my annual performance review where my boss got me a long overdue raise, which I was happy about until he ended it by saying that he wants me to return to the office starting next year. My two issues with this is that his reasoning for having me return to the office is so that I would be readily available to answer any questions he might have for me (he can just as easily email, call, IM, etc), and that I just do not work well when I am surrounded by people who don't appreciate the bliss of silence. I am just soaking up these final days before the new year. Ugh"
"You sound like a motivated and reliable person and if you answered things promptly which I imagine you probably do I'd let you work from home. My issue with lots of WFH employees is that you message them on hangouts or your internal messenger and you get an answer 4 hours later or maybe even the next day and sometimes that holds up what I'm working on, then I'm holding up someone else as well. The reality is many people basically stop working at noone or don't work at all and just occasionally pop into their laptop to check messages and/or emails and it slows things downfor people who actually do work. I'm not saying all WFH employees are like this but its a fair bit and these same people when they were in office would answer a hangouts message within a minute so WFH is clearly not working for them. Part of why were paid isn't to work 8 hours a day I think most logical people realize nobody is 100% focused for 8 hours per day but were paid for availability ie IF your needed between 9-5 your availbalbe and with WFH thats not the case with probably 30% of people"
"Totally agree. The RTO companies I worked for were also super micromanage-y and encouraged working over 40 hours a week. 

I think businesses know how competitive the job market is right now for fully remote jobs and how it's more difficult for current employees to fuck off with remote work. 

My old CEO literally said in an all-hands call: ""you can work fully remote, just not at this company"" and I cited that quote in my exit interview after accepting a 100% remote job lol"
Wow banner comment whsts your point my point is your the type and size of company who's always been remote so your not part of this conversation about recent events involving covid and the effect they've had on remote work. I can't debate with someoke this dense sorry
Have you tried creating your own WFH job?
"So many of these posts include windy explanations of how the traditional workplace is just *unbearable*. Yes it is. Should the world be better? Absolutely it should. But it's not. Not to sound too get-off-my-lawn about it, but in office work is still the default for most jobs. The majority of us started there and had to work that way for quite a long time in order to get to wfh.

It would be great if younger people could skip the struggles I faced in my career. But we don't live in that world yet. So far the world isn't reshaping itself for my convenience, and nobody else should be surprised when they have the same experience."

This is the problem. One reason I paid for a job agency, is because **EVERYONE** wants to work remote. **EVERYONE** wants an entry level remote job. **EVERYONE** wants to make decent money WFH.

Massive amount of demand, very little supply.

On the flip side, after working remote for 3 years now, remote workers have a higher turnover rate. So companies actually pay agencies to vet reps/workers for their job positions. That market is actually booming. Why? Because the agency usually trains the employees first, then places them, which means less money and time an employer needs to spend on the front end for someone. Additionally, a vetted employee/rep is 30% more likely to hit KPIs + stay with the business long term.

Edit: Forgot to mention, those companies that pay for those agencies to provide trained employees, only hire through the agency. How do I know this? I used to work for a company that provides these services to business owners. (**Elite CEOs** is the name of the business)"
"And need to WFH because your sister-in-law needs you to watch her kids, too."
It's not even skipping the struggles. A remote job is still a job. Most people on remote work subs on Reddit seem to think they'll be able to get paid to do next to nothing.
"I think if someone has a diagnosed condition, like anxiety, it can be insurmountable. That means it's a disability. That's an entirely different conversation. But I don't see posts about that as much as I see ""This is my first job ever, I've been working for 3 months and OMG, I hate it, is this the next 40 years of my life??""

The answer is no, its probably not the next 40 years. More importantly, these people need to recognize their limitations. If you're 3 months into your first job ever, sorry pal, you don't know anything yet. You've barely gotten your feet wet!

And that's becoming more common with the way the job market is. It's hard to find entry level jobs anymore, wfh or otherwise. I know an eighteen year old who took a year just to find a retail casher job. A friend's son has been applying for any and every job from the police academy down to Burger King, and he can't get hired. McDonald's said they were hiring, but they were so backed up with interviews they probably wouldn't be able to interview him for months. He's been searching for jobs daily for 2 years. He's 20 and has never had a job. I started working at 15, so 20 with no work experience sounds absurd to me. 

There's a lot of young people like this. Straight to college, and their first job is after graduation. They have no experience talking to a boss or working alongside someone who is a tool or talking to an angry customer or any workplace skills. Of course they're miserable, it's massive culture shock."
Lol or is it weird that people can't understand there's people this entitled/dumb now a days  I had 5 people this week begging me to hook them up with a wfh job.... 
"I wish.... I've worked for an Ohio municipality for 16 years now. Even during Covid we weren't allowed any remote work or reduced in-office hours. We recently received raises and I'm up to $44k. Yippee.  I want to leave so badly, but afraid to make the switch. I started my own business Dec 2020, but it hasn't taken off as well as I'd like because I'm locked in an office 5 days a week. No flex time, half hour lunches. So tired of it. But... Retirement is good if I work another 16 years and I'm up to 5 weeks vacation and have like 90 days of sick time built up (which, unfortunately, we don't get paid for when we leave).

Definitely ask questions in an interview. Not all government jobs have caught up with the times."
"It's not necessarily that it changed so much as you're describing two different things.

Freelance work and full time employment are completely different beasts. Freelancing is a simple arrangement, just as you described: you agree to pay a contractor $X for (Y) work. Simple.

Full time employment requires a different tax structure, it makes you and your employer subject to labor laws that vary from state to state and country to country, etc. It was always like that.

It's that prior to, like, 2021, remote or work from home jobs were pretty rare on the whole. The ones that existed were always like this, but you never knew it because, honestly, you didn't have to. Neither you nor anyone you knew had one. As they've become more common, the issues with them become more well known. But they aren't new."
"In my observation, pre COVID the idea of working remotely was mostly freelance, contract work, or developing streams of passive income through sales or courses. Then, the remote became popular, and people don't seem to understand that when you work for someone else as an employee, there are more labor laws and taxes involved ."
"Freelance work as well as remote wfh have become a rat race competition and at times that somewhat push people out of the race all together especially those who are not in the same region, time zone and thing. I have been looking a remote job something I can do off hours (like four hours after work) I am unable to do so because of where I am located (I am located in Jamaica) and if I am not in the USA or wherever this job is, I am outta luck."
"Honestly I agree. The thing is that digital work was never verified before. For example in my country the government decided only last year to check on influencers and demand them to pay taxes as they were making bank.
But the other issue I was mentioning was the difficulty of working remotely even with contracts now. My only solution is now to be actually an employee of the company and not a third party contractor. And that requires visa, settlement status, right to work in that country etc. Is difficult because before I had projects from different countries at the same time(Poland, US, Uk). And now I can't literally move into each country physically for one project"
"100% this. OP is confusing different types of employment. 

There are actually many more remote freelance jobs (as well as remote employee jobs) now than before the pandemic but there's also higher competition so it all evens out IMO. 

The location/country requirement could also be to have employees in closer time zones for easier collaboration or to have a more 
unified culture. A lot of companies are new to remote so it's natural they want to sync remote workers to their in person office culture."
Not to mention the IRS has literally hired thousands of new auditors to their payroll since the pandemic ended. Gig workers and wfh type jobs are being more scrutinized by the government to get their piece of the pie.
"Incredible credentials and still took you 9 months to finally land that remote work golden ticket.

Thank you for sharing and providing insight, especially those who are posting here with little to no experience and expecting to find a remote job within a few weeks. It's definitely tough out there"
"My thoughts:

\- Why do people talk about remote work as if it didn't exist pre-pandemic? I know several people who had remote careers before 2020 (in HR, accounting, freelance, etc) including myself for a short time (managing an e-comm site for a boutique)

\- How are people still so out of touch with what the majority actually like and dislike about office vs remote vs hybrid work?

\- I understand many roles require some level of in person work- but can we not just assess it on a case by case basis? We're at the point where we have to accept that many jobs function well or even better remotely, also that we're all individual human beings with different work styles, social needs, etc. No one wants to feel trapped somewhere, no matter how many 'fun activities' you shove in their face... it's about autonomy and practicality.

\- My pets, pjs, snacks, and lack of commute will never exist in an office and forced fun and socialization are my worst nightmares.

\- Emma could stand to find a hobby and friend group outside of work."
"I feel like a cog in the machine when I have to work in the office. Get up early, dress up, sit in traffic, and sit in an office full of distractions and germs doing a job I could do at home, more traffic on the way back. All for the sake of politics and real estate. I feel more human at home when can get more sleep in, have time to cook a healthy breakfast, do chores or walk around the neighborhood on breaks, spend more time with loved ones. I don't understand why WFH would make anyone feel more like a cog than in the office."
There are people on YouTube who announce work from home work. Arise is a platform you can join and get remote work.
"I totally feel you . I too have been applying for not only jobs since I got out of college in 2014, and now in the past few years I've been applying for remote work... but I never get a call back or even a response. All that's been keeping me kinda stable is working with my own clients. I don't understand how there are so many listings and one just rarely gets called back or interviewed when you have all the skills they're looking for."
No problem. See that line of 15 million other people just like you looking for remote work? Get in it. While you're waiting to win the remote work lottery you'll just have to do what every other mere mortal does.
A lot of people are claiming disability to find remote work.  What makes you stand out?
May I contact you as well? Also looking for remote work with zero success and loads of customer service experience.
Lol I think he is just saying that lots of people say they are disabled so if he is disabled then what has he done to make his resume stand out. He is competing like so many others for remote work.
"Former Sys admin and Network Engineer that transitioned to DevOps here. The top skills to be Marketable for remote work are Kubernetes, Terraform, and Cloud Engineering.

I've been remote for the past 5 years with three different employers now.


I recommend studying for the CKAD exam."
"Remote Work for traditional IT is usually hard to come by and very unstable. Once I realized that developers were eating my lunch, it became a survival instinct that kicked in for me. Adapt or die. I invest hundreds of dollars of personal professional development on books and e-learning courses every year.

I get it life is tough, we are getting older, kids and family compete with constantly evolving technology and I fantasize all the time of taking an easy helpdesk/support technician role and just kick back and relax.

But I can't. I am the breadwinner for my family and insisting on a worldwide remote position is everything for me."
"**Pros:**

* Control over my office environment such as lighting, noise, and desk setup help me be more productive.
* Cutting out commute time helps me make better use my non-work time, including more physical activity and authentic socializing.
* Deep work, which was hard for me to do in an open office, has helped me tap into my creativity and showcase my strengths.
* Relationships with coworker friends that's not based on forced socializing. 
* Working in companies/industries that don't exist or are less common near where I live. 

**Con**: 

* Other people's perceptions of remote work. This is *not* a huge deal but I do get annoyed sometimes. 

*Happy to answer any questions :)*"
"I'm a software engineer, and remote work is great because I don't have to deal with morning/afternoon commute

I can work outside whenever I want to

I can work from mostly anywhere there is internet

I do get a bit lonely, but I have activities outside of work to keep me busy.

My work is mostly self directed, so I can just pick a new one off the stack and move about my day.

I would say a lot depends on how the company treats remote workers will determine your happiness with your job..."
"I would really like to find one of these jobs, but job searches like indeed seem to be no help and I have absolutely no office experience so how does one find entry level work from home huh"
"We agree completely! We may be a bit biased here (since we operate a [remote job board](https://remotejobs.guru)) but our growth has been tremendous. The amount of employers and interested candidates continue to grow everyday. It is our theory that the continued negative outlook towards remote work by the media is likely tied to falling commercial real estate prices. There is a big push to regenerate interest in commercial real estate, as this has historical been a safe investment vehicle for the wealthy for decades. If this loss in commercial real estate continues , there will likely be a large market correction as a result. There is a strong attempt to avoid this for obvious reasons."
"Not dying but not growing (currently). Quote from recent BB article ""Fewer than 26% of US households still have someone working remotely at least one day a week, a sharp decline from the early-2021 peak of 37%, according to the two latest Census Bureau Household Pulse Surveys.""

I've watched several friends move back to the city and now rent due to mortgage payments being too high. With the current state of the economy and tightening job market, I think WFH is going to go through a rough patch but certainly won't disappear."
"I do not think it is dead or going to die (at least in the foreseeable future). I myself. reject any job offer that is not fully 100% remote. I have been working from home for the past 7 years and I am not going back to an office.  

Companies need to adapt. During Covid, people moved away from downtown looking for cheaper options. People's lives have changed, they had kids, they moved maybe to a different state or province. You cannot expect all these people to magically revert their lives to the way it was before Covid for God's sake.  

I think we are in a Kodak situation here. Companies who are rejecting the WFH culture are going to be repellent to good talents and overtime they will either succumb to the new paradigm shift or just fail miserably."
I've been trying to work with state rehab but doesn't seem like that's gonna find anything. I'm just in a really bad situation right now and moving forward work from home gonna be my only option. Possibly even start some schooling but any type of tech I might be interested in possibly to fast pace. Then to make things worse my Internet might not even be acceptable for wfh jobs from what I've seen. I'm using T-Mobile home crap.  I don't know hopefully something will fall in my lap
"The most employers open for remote work are within the tech industry. The most common job offered is for Software Engineers. This was expected, as they were the most abundant before the pandemic and have been equipped to handle this type of work from the start"
I would check YouTube channels that give the best information on wfh jobs. Try Justin Bryant channel 
"Sometimes, it's worth it just to get away from the toxicity. Then, you can start looking for a new job while working remotely. And, if you're generally happy with the work, you can take your time and make sure you find something that you really want."
"Google this:

Remote Online Initiative Utah State University 

It's a training course on how to work remotely. Excellent information on remote working, job hunting, and resume prep. I think it's a $300 cost that was well worth it. I had no remote experience, and while I still had to put in dozens of applications, I landed a customer service job answering calls to help people order home health care equipment. I am pretty happy with it. Good luck."
Do you mean remote work or physical labor in town? There isn't much of anything that pays decent wages where I live.
"I think the mismatch makes a lot of sense.   If you're a worker in West Virginia, rural Maine, or Baltimore and you can't find work locally because of lack of jobs, lack of transportation etc then of course you're going to look at remote work."
"Companies don't understand that remote work is the only way employees can control job costs. 

Commuting is the biggest expense with the cost of gasoline. Further, having an on-site job dictates where you live and gives you little control over what you spend on housing.

But there are many other costs that add up like professional attire (shoes alone are a killer), meals, the missed time due to communicable illnesses, etc.

What employers don't understand is that the demand for remote work isn't so much about being able to slack off. Remote work is the only way most workers can afford to have a job. I need $5 an hour more to compensate for the difference.

Either pay your workers more or let them stay home. Those are your choices."
"Exactly! Also, remote work would help with even population distribution across the country and help with unemployment in certain areas."
"Don't limit yourself to remote work.

Remote jobs are 10% of the job market and they get 50% of ALL THE FREAKING JOB APPLICATIONS.

Lottery winner odds of getting one.  

So stop treating your job search like Vegas.   Go for the on-site roles.   Less competition.  And MAYBE, once you prove yourself to your boss - you can negotiate working some remote time."
If you're struggling financially you sould probably find an in person job and work that to make some money while seeking a remote job. I'm shocked how many people dig their heels in and would rather struggle financially and go into debt than look outside of remote work even if temporarily. This isn't the same job market it was 2 years ago
"This person is asking for help. What's wrong with helping if you can? Unfortunately, I don't have any information regarding remote work. Seek out any help in the area where you live.  don't give up something good will come out of this situation.  Someone might not help. I believe there are more people willing to help than not. Blessings ."
It's almost as if the OP didn't specifically ask for remote work suggestions 
"For some reason, people treat remote work like a luxury since the pandemic. Some people work remotely because that's the ONLY way they can work. Nobody owes you an explanation. People are not holding out & risking losing everything for no reason."
"Working in person isn't an option for me unfortunately,However I understand what you're saying on finding an in person job first then going remote but remote work is only the option for me"
"Everyone thinks they'll be able to find a great remote position that pays well where they don't need any experience, and they want strangers on the Internet to guide them to this  mythical job so they don't have to do anything silly like look  for a job on their own. 

People that are this clueless about what remote work actually is obviously aren't going to be responsible or qualified enough to actually do remote work. They SHOULD be looking for an in person job. This page isn't supposed to be a job board."
"This sub isn't called ""find me a remote job"". Do your own research and come back with a list of positions and ask if anyone's heard of them. Otherwise, what do you really want here? Everyone to provide you a list and also checking if they're available in 'Asia'? If you need all of that handed to you, you're not ready for remote work because you won't be spoonfed answers."
Remote work literally is a choice but okay. Contradicting yourself was your first fail.
"I'm a software Developer and my job can be done ALL by remote work.  However, my company only allows 1 day remote a week.  Even Amazon(the big tech giant that can be done remote) sent out an ultimatum that all remote worker go back into the office or fired.  
If you're patient, very qualified, VERY GOOD network connections, or just lucky, then you will find remote work.  
If you're desperate, then in-person is the way to go.  Sorry you don't want to hear this but desperate times require desperate measures."
"Have you read the description? This sub is not a job board.

""This subreddit is a place for teams, companies and individuals who want to share news, experience, tips, tricks, and software about working remotely or in distributed teams."""
"if you can handle it for a few months (assuming you get the position), and you are a rockstar of en employee, especially on days you WFH, you may be able to leverage that performance to get either full WFH or at least reduced hybrid time in office.  become indispensable to the company. management will go out of their way (SOMETIMES) to accommodate productive employees.  don't hide your back issues - let them know you have a chronic condition.  maybe ask initially, with a doctor's note, for a standing desk if it marginally helps you out.  once they. see your great performance, coupled with a doctor's note, you'll be better positioned to make the ask."
1) If it was a remote position the company would have advertised it that way. 2) A note from your doctor regarding WFH carries zero weight.
"Makes sense, thanks. I just wonder if they would be pissed off if I didn't mention anything during the hiring process, then after a few weeks I come in with my cane and say ""hey can we talk about working remotely?"" "
"Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I don't think I could handle it for a few months, maybe a few weeks at most. Standing for a long time is as bad as sitting for me and I have a reclining-type setup at home (which still isn't completely pain-free, but it's a lot better). 

Maybe if I get to the point where they contact my references I can ask them to be sure to mention that I never missed deadlines or anything like that in almost 10 years of WFH in my previous position (I got laid off because company seems like it's going under and they're trying to stay afloat, not due to performance). Appreciate the advice though I'll keep it in mind!"
"Asking to work remote wouldn't be/isn't considered a reasonable accommodation though.   


You can easily search this sub (and similar) and see how many people have tried to use a ""medical accommodation"" as leverage to WFH, and failed. It's the new age version of ""the dog ate my homework""."
"Your instincts are right. This isn't something I would bring up immediately. I probably wouldn't bring it up unless I got an offer.  If you get an offer it can be a part of your negotiations. They might even have remote work set up as a reasonable accommodation for people in your situation. 

That said you could ask about their Hybrid policy in the interview.  Some companies are relaxed about hybrid policies and don't really enforce it. They just want people to be in the general area so they can come in when needed."
On-site work is miserable. WFH is less miserable
"Don't exaggerate, mate; I don't know such a world. You can't work in a cafe or while walking in the park. This is your dream anyway :)) I've worked as a remote worker for 5 years. There hasn't been a day when I've danced while working. I've never worked in a cafe, either. Maybe this is about my job. Like you, let me not exaggerate:)) I am a content writer. I also worked in social mining. But I can't tolerate the sound of music or children's noise when I'm working. I don't have to get up early in the morning, run to the subway and spend hours on the roads. I work in my pyjamas and decide my working hours by myself. But just because we don't go to the office, I don't think we're living in heaven. I have a job to produce. It's nice to do this in the comfort of home. That's all!"
That's another experience right there! Hopefully you find a balance and someday have a full work from home job.
You definitely would be better in a WFH job. I'm relaxed and at ease.  most days I finish earlier than 5pm . I go for a walk or take a shower on breaks. Whatever I need to do . On days I'm sick or in pain I can still do my job usually no one notices I'm working a tiny bit slower
"Thank you for your comment! Really helps me think and plan more for this change (if I find a job). I've been worried about the social aspect. I'd say 4 out of 5 days I hate the distractions and noise level at work but some days, especially on Fridays, I love talking with my colleagues throughout the day and having them around me. 

I'm definitely leaning towards 100% remote work having way more positive aspects for me than to 100% office. Hybrid I guess would be great, but not many companies around here do that.. Just might move countries due to the work culture here!"
"I don't think remote work is what you think it is. It does not work well with depression (isolation, chained to keyboard, etc.). I'm not sure about autism. It will not give you the freedom to do what you want during working hours. It's still work."
"Data entry sounds like your best bet. But just so you know, remote work doesn't mean zero social interactions. People randomly call me at... let's say very 'inconvenient' times all the time and I gotta drop everything and take the call."
"Sorry OP. Your skills, knowledge, bi-lingual is Normal and Common. It's the same as other thousands of job applicants out there looking for work. You are not going to find any remote work unless you have Expertise over the rest. And thousands also have these same or better Expertise. Sorry to say you wont get any remote job OP."
"Google search for remote work audio editing. Looks like a common remote work job type. LinkedIn also has a good job board. Look through these listings and set up your LinkedIn profile to use similar language and then set your status to ""open to work"". Respond to the recruiters even if you don't want the role. It's good to start a conversation, and then they will keep you in mind for roles that come along in the future."
Wow lmfao.  Me and my wife work from home.  Have for years.  Not sure why it gets so much hate.   Sorry you have to bust your ass in manual labor and your jealous 
"I don't hate remote work, I love it since I also work from home. It's all these people who ""want a remote job"" but have zero job skills that translate into a position that is remotely offered. But good try lol"
"You would be surprised what having control over your environment can do to help with how well an autistic person can perform in their job. 

I am a suspected autistic person and I went from working in doctors offices to WFH when I finished my degree to now a hybrid job where I spend a ton of time in traffic driving around Los Angeles. Working remote exclusively where I had control over all the lighting, temperature of the room, texture of the fabrics I wore, lack of distractions, and everything else, helped tremendously with my ability to complete my work tasks. I worked as an account manager so I spent a lot of time on video calls and on the phone with demanding clients and I was able to do what I needed to do to take care of my mental well being and even though my job was awful it was palatable. 

My job now is at a non-profit and the job itself is easier, but having to be in business clothes, in traffic, in weather, in strange places, talking to strangers all day is exhausting. It takes a lot of mental preparation to be able to do this job. It's something so simple for neurotypical people and they don't even think about it but for neurodivergent people it's nearly debilitating. It's hard to explain, hopefully that I've said makes sense a bit."
"I think what the person you responded to is mainly trying to get across is that remote work is still work, and most of them, *especially* entry level work is customer service and that doesn't mean it's easy (maybe easier but not easy) and it doesn't mean you get to have time during work to work on other things such as writing music as OP mentioned. I did hybrid work for a non profit for a while and while I was lucky enough to not have my screen time monitored, I still had to work my ass off at home and had to attend virtual meetings. For reference, I was an assistant to an exec and did other data entry and editing jobs for the company. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but from what I know if you have special skills/expertise or have a job where you're higher up, it can be easier to find remote work where you don't have to be in front of the computer the full 8 hours but if you're entry level, you're going to have to do the work and stay on the computer."
"Exactly. The impression I got from OP is that they want a WFH job so they can do other things throughout the day. In reality, you cannot do that, especially in entry-level call center roles. 

I also understand that OP has autism and depression, which yes, make it harder to work, but what OP wants in a role is unrealistic."
"Entry level = phones. Call center even. Here is the deal though, you are on the phones until you level up and they take you off. I haven't taken a call in more than a year because they plucked me from the team and made me into a trainer. Perhaps try to work around this obstacle if you can. If not, I wish you luck in finding alternate way to WFH. Where there is a will, there is a way."
"Yes. Just need to have experience in an industry you're interested in. I worked 2.5 years in marketing in an office then got recruited for a position at our corporate level. 

If you don't have experience in that industry, it's going to be difficult, definitely possible. 

Your best bet is to work in an office for a few years and keep on applying for remote work. 

Also, network, become friends with others when the opportunity presents itself."
Being a software engineer is likely the best remote work career so it's good you're going down that route. Have you looked into virtual assistant jobs in the meantime? That blends a variety of tasks so it's not as mundane as a call center.
"Without a decent amount of experience/education in an industry that's usually open to remote work, probably not.

Could you do any kind of online school while you're nannying?"
"Are you into the stock market? Do you have a good amount of cash you can invest with? If you apply yourself you could try doing day trading. I've been doing it for 7 months now after my company laid me off (difital marketing) so that they could save a few pennies off-shore. I was unemployed for 5 months, got into trading eith money saved over 8 years from my previous job and now I'm a freelance trader. Work from home, the beach, an airplane, doesn't matter. And, you're on your OWN time."
"I was going to recommend underwriting too, since OP has mortgage experience. I'm a WFH underwriter & rarely on the phone. When I am it's through ms teams & can turn on auto captions."
"It really depends on the culture that the company has cultivated around remote work. I work for a fully remote marketing agency and flexible time is HUGE for us. It's one of our benefits. I am in pajamas for almost all of my meetings lol. My boss doesn't care about cameras being on for Zoom calls. My company overall is extremely laid back because we're all trusted to get our work done and we do just that. I do laundry, cook, shower, go for a walk, etc. all during my work day. I also occasionally do walking meetings with my mentor just for some variety. Sometimes I work from my bed if I'm being lazy in the morning. But none of that affects my work or its quality, I get everything done."
"It depends on the job, your work culture, and your responsibilities. If you're never on camera then sure I guess you could go days without showering or changing out of your pajamas.

My job is daily relaxed. I rarely have meetings with anyone outside my company so wearing a T-shirt or hoodie most days is perfectly acceptable. I make it a point to shower and change every morning. It's very easy to turn into a slob when you work from home. Keeping a morning routine helps to draw that boundary between working from home and relaxing at home.

Yes I can throw in a load of laundry, get dinners started, etc during the day. I can even squeeze in an errand if I don't have any meetings. But I check my notifications so I can still respond while I'm away from my computer if I'm supposed to be working. My boss doesn't mind if I step away in the middle of the day as long as it doesn't affect the team's work and our performance.

We eventually had to let 1 employee go because she kept logging off around 3pm and logging back on insanely late like around 11pm to finish the rest of her work. This meant some of her work was consistently late and there was no one from our department available when other teams needed our input."
"If you're in the running I would be asking about the work from home culture, expectations around working hours and availability, technology use and reimbursement, video meetings etc.. The best place to get answers is from the company. They might falsely represent the culture but pay attention and you'll know what to look for in the future. It also depends on the role. I take walks and do laundry during the work day some days. I'll listen to a company meeting or training while making coffee or cleaning up."
"It is best to still dress for work to be in the mindset and to sort of have a divide when you are on and when you are at home despite being at home the whole time.   I use a free app called Toggl along with Asana which helps me stay focused and see where my day goes as it comes to work.  It is nice to not commute and to be home for any contractor or Plumber or to get packages or to run to the store at lunch so dinner is easy as my wife works outside the house.

Focus on being good and reliable and setting sensible breaks for yourself and it works itself out.  Plus the tracksuit has meaning after the day or week is done.  Three years deep working remotely for the same place for me.

Also making time to take care of your health matters.  By that, a long run, maybe a cardio workout on YouTube or a run or a bike ride before you start makes such a difference.   The time you get back not commuting makes it more possible and makes for better endurance and decision making."
"I have the same routine whether I'm at home or going to the office. Get up, exercise, shower, get dressed, work; I'm at my desk at the same time either way. I was 100% during Covid and now WFH 3 days a week.


The only differences are the length of my morning exercise, what I wear (sweats vs business casual), and what I do during the time I step away from my desk.


At home I'll change out the laundry, chop veggies for dinner, or some other small tasks throughout the day. At work there's more socializing with coworkers or other work-adjacent tasks (I arrange to take our excess unopened food products to pantries)."
"My wife works from home one day a week; she looks pretty goofy in her pajama pants with a business-casual shirt but she sometimes has to be on camera for meetings with colleagues and students. Sometimes our cats attend the meetings too, but usually they keep busy with all their daytime sunshine naps. She doesn't do any chores on her WFH days, but I guess it could depend on your role."
"At 3:30 pm, 3 days a week, I prep dinner for my parents so that they can eat at 5 pm.  While cooking, I'm multi-tasking other household chores, so the evening work is done.  Then, I can log back in and finish my day. It's the flexibility and autonomy of determining my schedule that sold me on WFH positions. Make no mistake, the clock-watching micro-managers still exist in the world,  but you won't typically find them in charge of a remote team., so that's a positive!"
"It depends on the job, when I started remote work I had a home office with a laptop and docking station with 3 monitors, I worked customer service. Now I'm an operations manager and I turn my laptop on in bed, look at my calendar and go back to bed until my first meeting. I work a hybrid schedule though so it only works 3 days a week lol"
"Congrats on being in the running for a remote position! 

As someone who works remotely, I can assure you that the perks you mentioned are indeed legitimate. Working remotely offers flexibility, allowing you to integrate personal tasks into your day. 

You can certainly throw in a load of laundry, empty the dishwasher, or even foster kittens during your breaks. However, it's important to maintain a balance and prioritize work responsibilities."
"Depends on the job. My remote job is more work than my in person jobs and I don't have a lot of downtime.

Keep in mind what you see on Instagram is not always reality. People on Instagram often give remote work a bad rep as a bunch of millennials working on a beach with a martini in hand or soaking in the bathtub or taking care of their kids while working. That's far far from reality. 

Most of us are pretty busy, but during lunch break you'll have them to say get caught up on laundry or get the mail, etc."
"I only wear makeup for meetings or if I'm leaving the house. Which means on days I don't have to do either I'm a pantless goblin. And if there is a rare last-minute meeting my company is cool about keeping the camera off.

Laundry, home-cooked meals,  pilates lunch break, midday shower, pop out for a cuppa if the weather is nice. But I also will work on things while I'm doing laundry or cooking.  If you aren't having live interactions with people it's pretty easy.  I would imagine people with WFH call centre type jobs have it harder."
I find weirdly wearing shoes too helps.  Some ritual to mark work from home mode.
"Google top sites for finding remote work, there are a few companies that are dedicated to sharing remote opportunities like Remotive, We Work Remotely, [Remote.Co](https://Remote.Co), etc. and start there. A lot of remote opportunities tend to be start ups / in the tech area so you should be able to find something."
"Have you considered independent contracting? When my employer forced RTO, that's what I switched too. In the USA, it's much easier to 1099 ICs than W-2 employees. 

I personally think 1099 is a better model for remote/WFH jobs. With W-2 employees it's the employer's job to comply with tax & labor law where YOU work. With 1099 contractors, it's YOUR job to comply with the law. 

For example, most companies like ""at-will"" employment. Well, one State (Montana) doesn't allow ""at-will"" employment. This can be a major pain-in-the-ass for a company hiring a remote employee. What if they move to Montana?   


There are downsides to 1099, fewer labor laws protect you. But, it's an idea."
"Don't give up.  Been working as a coder remotely since 2000.  I have watched a few cycles of RTO, it never sticks.  People are miserable, leave, company realizes mistake - lather, rinse, repeat.  

My current company is going through this right now.  My contract is remote so they can't make me come in.  But last year they tried to force everyone that had started remote work during COVID to come back in to the office.  A bunch quit.  Some came back in for a while, some just ignored the directive altogether.  The office is a ghost town again now.  Haven't seen anyone from the teams I deal with have anything but their home in the background on Zoom in months."
"I work fully remote and I'm only 30, with about 8 years in my field. It's definitely possible to get remote work without 20 years of experience."
"If you read stuff on Reddit, it seems like RTO is king and remote is out. Not true. You just have to be diligent in your searches for jobs. WFH is not a new concept. It's been around for a really long time."
"A lot of companies that started remote wfh jobs during the pandemic are just now learning the impact of their business. They may switch back to wfh if they go RTO. The company I work for started work from home about 10 years ago. During pandemic they made the conscious decision to estimate have the remaining in office jobs would be phased out and become wfh. The real estate was sold off or if leased, phased out"
I am in the contracts department which is a division of purchasing. Started at a hospital many moons ago and then found my WFH job at a large healthcare supply company.
"They are decently paid I suppose. Data analytics and a bit of teaching. Most WFH people I know have a lot of specialized skills like Ux design, graphic design, architecture, fin tech sales, project management, and programming. I did meet a couple people in my home town who work in bill collections and customer service from home though."
"I worked for the Canadian branch primarily ( because I live in Canada) but I also worked for a short time on a side project for HGS US. Hinduja Global Solutions is the name of the company. Here's the link: [https://www.joinhgs.com/us](https://www.joinhgs.com/us) I don't work for them anymore, so this isn't an affiliate link or anything sketchy. I can't speak to the US branch, but my time there was great from a company standpoint, but terrible from a customer standpoint. You get assigned a random client (mine was a large Canadian telecom), you do not get to choose your initial client, but sometimes you can be chosen for side projects or other contracts. They sent me all the equipment needed no problem. Just be sure that you have a room that you can have wired internet and phone line run to, and you MUST be able to close the door. They're big on that. You're not able to work from just anywhere in your home, it needs to be a home office with a door and covered windows. 

Best of luck!"
"Yes, I can't believe nobody has told you since 2022 that entry level work is not going to fly for remote work.

To be a successful remote employee, you have to know what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. All on your own. Sure, you can ask some co-workers. But ultimately, remote work should be for senior level workers with a lot of experience. 

I don't mean this to be rude, but I learned a ton in the office when I was a lower level employee."
"First, remote work for entry level is tricky. There are a lot of things like social skills you learn in an office that are tough with remote work. A lot of the folks I met who started remote at entry level are somewhat stunted. My firm allows tons of full remote, but typically entry level have to be hybrid for a little while.

The second is that if you're still in school, you aren't really ready for entry level professional jobs yet. I worked at random retail jobs until I finished my bachelor's, and then applied for entry level jobs. Most of my friends also either worked retail or waited tables."
You gotta understand that a lot of us who work remotely had earned experience prior to the remote work revolution of the COVID pandemic. You gotta probably go out and drive out to offices in the real world before you get trusted with remote work.
"Onboarding remote workers is hard, so is onboarding a complete newb. No one wants to do both at once, if they can avoid it."
"It was rather rare before the pandemic. During 2020, companies were compelled to hire remote, and everyone noticed that even entry-level jobs could be onboarded remotely. Now, I believe it's swinging back for odd political reasons, but I think remote work will tend to be normalized as we move forward. Employees and people like you have to push for it. Me  as a professional with plenty of experience in my field, I've had many conversations with my employer in the past year about RTO. Even if I could come back, I believe it's important to argue against it"
"Honestly, entry level remote work will never be a thing for first world countries. If you can train anyone to do a job in a week with minimal skill and education, you can farm that job out to the Philippines, Argentina, or India for $4 an hour. The minimum wage in most developed countries is going to be much higher than that"
"""I don't have a formal education nor marketable skills to benefit a prospective employer, but I want to work from home.""

Reasons for needing remote work:
~Health (physical or emotional)
~Transportation
~Taking care of sick relative/child//pet/etc
~School/other job"
"This is the crux of the issue. Low-skilled jobs (like data entry) are already outsourced tonplaces like India.

An entry-level candidate is precisely that- a low-skilled employee.

So think about it, why would they pay US salary for a role when they can pay India salary? They can hire 3-4 employees in India for one US salary. 

That's why when you're more experienced, you can demand things like working remotely."
"It's not for political reasons it's for tax reasons. If a company has an office in a city or town, they're getting a big tax break for being there. A common requirement for these tax breaks is that the building needs to be occupied more than a certain percent at all times of a work day. This is to incentivize these employees to spend money in the city/town and it boosts their economy to make up for the tax breaks. It all comes down to money. Major reason for RTO for my company as well as making WFH accommodations next to impossible to get. They instead offer anything else possible they can do in office. Focus rooms, extra breaks, even setting your own hours. My role/department is one of just a handful left of fully remote jobs in the company"
"I've been WFH for nearly twenty years. I run my own business so my time is flexible, but if I don't work I don't get paid. I work seventy to ninety hours per week. I love what I do. 

My wife and I each have our own home offices and I also have a lab in the basement. I have customers all over the world so my sleep pattern is pretty broken up. When we're home we always have dinner together. 

I really need to get more exercise. That's my biggest challenge. I was a gym rat in my youth but now I just get bored."
"I'd love to chime in! I haven't experienced significant work-life balance challenges due to remote work. Here are some ways I've established work-life balance: 

* Have a dedicated space for work, including an AIO desktop instead of a laptop. 
* Take breaks away from my desk.
* Don't take work devices with me on a break or lunch hour.
* Go out and don't use WFH as a reason to be cooped up in the house.
* Use my former commute time to exercise, meditate, cook, clean, do laundry, 
* Wear my old tops and cardigans on camera along with comfy bottoms such as leggings, yoga pants, and slippers. 
* Track how much time I work so that I'm not overcompensating. 
* Decide how much I want to share about my personal life and with whom.
* Connect with coworkers I like.
* When I first started WFH several years ago, my children were younger and I had part-time childcare.

I think work-life balance is an issue for some professionals but it's not specific to remote work. And remote work isn't limited to people who started remote work within the last four years. My work-life balance has improved since WFH. I usually work the same hours every day but can work an earlier schedule than I was able to in my in-person jobs, thanks to async work. I also have greater focus so I'm able to be more creative and be ""at work"" fewer hours, though I'm technically ""at work"" more hours than I was actually productive when I was in person.

Happy to answer any questions!"
"As a remote worker, maintaining work-life balance is key. Biggest challenges often include staying focused amidst distractions and drawing clear boundaries between work and personal life. To combat this, establishing a designated workspace and scheduling regular breaks helps me stay on track. Communication with colleagues also aids in fostering a supportive remote environment."
"Remote work has been the best thing for me. Way less stress, I can focus on my health more, I get to spend much much more time with my family, etc. etc. 

I get everything done. Fuck off."
"It takes a few years to figure out. You have to be comfortable and competent at setting boundaries. Boundaries with work people. Boundaries with your partner (no, just because you work from home does not mean you're their errand bitch constantly - your time is still important in the same way theirs is if they are not remote). The lack of commute time is pretty huge though IMO and it's worth it."
Thank you for sharing. I began working remotely a couple of years ago and have experienced similar challenges. There is a lot of old and new research that shows the sociological and psychological impact of social media and remote work but there is so much we are still learning.
This is why employers are pulling wfh.
"I would have a hard time doing any remote job, if I also had to watch my kids.  One is in preschool and my wife is at home watching the other.  I spend time with them during breakfast, but I'm working the rest of the day in my home office."
"This. 

As soon as companies started trying to make everyone RTO over qualified people started taking jobs like the ones you have been applying for to continue working remotely. Your best bet is to take one of the abandoned in office jobs to gain experience then look for remote later."
Remote work is the way now. Most organizations have adopted this method.
"Are you guys hiring for any entry-level roles? I'm extremely computer savvy and a very quick learner, picking up new software is a breeze for me. Most of my experience involved hands on lab work concerning organic chemistry in a heavily regulated industry, offering me a great deal of attention to detail and analytical decision making. I've done plenty of data entry and technical writing for tracking metrics and creating lab procedures, respectively, as well as managing LIMS to track batches/sales and maintain overall compliance. Your shining review of remote work and your companies stance inspired me to take a chance at asking. Though, I can understand if there's nothing available. Cheers!"
"Ask one of those AI apps for remote work companies, and they'll find you a bunch of sites you can apply to  "
"If the company has any U.S. federal government contracts, that's a standard restriction on remote work. Many companies have other restrictions, such as the employee being within a certain radius or within certain state(s). Whenever a remote worker is in a different state than the employer, there is paperwork that has to be done to establish a business presence there and handle state tax correctly. For future interviews you'll know to inquire early about restrictions on remote work. Making the assumption ""remote"" meant you could work anywhere was an understandable mistake, but assumptions leave one vulnerable to bad outcomes such as this one. Gotta communicate."
"There are a variety of job options available that span across different eras, ranging from prehistoric times corporations with strict in-office policies, to newer companies that embrace the idea of remote work. There are also many companies that fall somewhere in between these two extremes. It can take some time to find the perfect job, but don't give up hope. It took me about four months to secure a fully remote job, so patience and persistence are key."
"This is extremely inaccurate. Still tons of remote work out there, tons of it."
"Flexjobs.com has vetted work from home jobs, but they charge a fee. Keep in mind that you'll still need to pay for daycare."
"Remote is merely a location. It's still a job.

Remote jobs don't exist so you can get paid to care for your own child while pretending to ""work."" Many places will expect you to provide proof of childcare outside the home.

Your employer would expect you to prioritize your job and not be focused on your ""stressful home life"" just like any other job.

>I've been looking for the past month and it's always something commission only, ramp up period this, pyramid scheme that.

The hard truth that people on this and other remote work subs need to accept is that if these are the kinds of jobs you're encountering, you are likely not competitive for any remote job and will be competing with thousands of people for any job you do apply for. Getting a good job, regardless of location, generally requires the right combo of education, specific skills, and experience. There is not some magic secret trove of good remote jobs for underqualified people - contrary to what the jobseekers on this sub desperately want to believe. The places to find remote work are exactly the same as the places to find on-site work. 

If you're not qualified for a good in -person job, you're likely not qualified for a good remote job."
To be fair I didn't mention it at first but i didn't think to because I've never looked for remote work before. But I did comment it several times especially in the thread that is the longest lol (also the moms in the momworkingfromhom sub make it seem like it's all good tbh) imo whatever works for you works for you just don't go against company policy I guess
"You failed to mention that, which is a huge fail on you, but even bigger you failed to mention any skills you might have. You can't just wing it and get a random job that happens to be wfh. What can you do?  Why can't you go back to your old job?"
"I am a working mom so no prejudice here. It's rude to hide behind a keyboard and leave nasty remarks so I won't defend that kind of behavior. 

But I don't think it's that most people here are against working moms. They are defensive about remote work being undermined. That's why you'll see a lot of responses remind people that remote work is a location and that you still need to be a skilled professional. 

Unfortunately, your post does read as if you're intending to look for a job you can do without childcare since you mentioned details about your personal situation but didn't tell us what kind of work you do, what field you're in, etc.  

I don't know if you can edit your original post but if you can, I recommend editing it and trying a different approach."
"The problem is - and I am a mother - is many request remote work to do while they parent. Stop. You can't do either one 'well' if combining and all know it. 

Do you have capacity to work without keeping your children alive as in their caregiver?? I think that's where the hate is coming from: many of us work legit salaries while other try to work and them parent kids the entire time. It's not possible."
"It has nothing to do with mothers trying to get a job (I'm 6 months pregnant with my first so I'd be on your side if there was glaring prejudice). There's an overwhelming sentiment on these subs from people who don't yet work remote that you can care for children while working from home. A lot of people (men and women) are looking for remote work so that they don't have to pay for childcare. The feedback can be a little harsh, but it's also important to set realistic expectations for people who want to work from home. 

Either way, it doesn't seem like you want remote work because you're a new mom. You want remote work for other reasons that you didn't mention. So it doesn't really matter."
"I was a stay at home mom. I worked from home while my kid was in daycare. It's bitterness bc most of the time it's against company policy, and if not it's distracting as hell. You're very likely to be fired if you don't have childcare while you're working. That's standard practice. I'm baffled that you didn't realize a screaming baby that needs attention every 15 min would be a problem while trying to work. I imagine you can find a catering job of some kind that's wfh but not with a baby. You need to find childcare. Then you might not need wfh and can probably make more money. Probably not what you want to hear but that's how it works."
"Will someone help me, I'm looking for a work from home job rite now asap?"
"I have a friend looking to get into remote work, would you be willing to dm me?"
Hello I'm very late to the party but desperately searching for a job to work from home. I don't have a vehicle but just moved from the city to  a rural area due to my grandma being in the early stages of Alzheimer's. As the days go by I worry more and more about leaving her home during the day while I'm at work. Not to mention it's very difficult to even find Ubers compared to the city and can't justify working for half my paycheck going to rides. And if this isn't still available do you have any advice I have over a decade of customer service and hospitality experience in various jobs as well as administrative assistant and I'm just looking for something that pays decently and isn't a scam. I feel silly asking since so much time has gone by but figured it would be worth a shot ha
I am interested in working remotely :)
"Hello, I just followed you but cannot for the life of me figure out how to DM you. I'm very interested in the info you have on APPEN remote work"
"I know there are a lot of people also asking for DMs, but do you think you can hit me up with one too? Really trying to find good remote work. Thanks!"
"If a company is not set up to handle all the tax and regulatory issues in the state you want to go to, it might be cost prohibitive. It can also be a lot of work for HR. My company has WFH folks all over the country, but not in all states. They tend to hire their people from select states but in various time zones. I know some higher ups in my company have convinced them to add states so they could move, but they were c-suite people who have a lot of pull. You can ask, but I would not be surprised if they turned you down."
"We are currently seeking remote workers proficient in English and other languages for a translation project. If you have experience in translating documents and are interested in this opportunity,  send me a private message for further details."
"Hi. I've been working remotely since I graduated from HS in 2017 - First before anything create a resume that exentuates your skills, experience (Even if unpaid) as well as your goal & Objective Career wise.

Secondly find all the job search sites in which you can upload your resume and DO THAT. This will ensure while your not actively looking for work recruiters are passively still looking over hundreds of resumes including yours once you upload. Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn etc.

Next look into work from home jobs on places like Google Job search, Indeed, LinkedIn ETC. Sometimes these sites will have an option to perform a Job search for the role you're looking for in your case (Developer, programmer, programming, etc) and have an option to choose remote. Do this. 


I would suggest first looking for remote roles in your area as you may find Hybrid roles that could work (Hybrid meaning ability to work from home while also coming into the office every so often)

Often recruiters will search for resumes based on keywords. When a Keyword is searched anyone with that keyword on their resume will show up and if enough keywords show up contact will try and be established. In your case make sure to put in keywords that relate to programming."
Depends on what sort of job you're looking for. I've been WFH since before the pandemic. Nonprofit accounting for orgs across the state. What are you looking for?
"I look for remote work online,

Get contacted by a scammer,

keep looking

repeat"
"I hope you're still leaving the office to go to the toilet and not going all Howard Hughes

I rarely work from other rooms of the house because I am more productive on a multi monitor, mouse and keyboard setup than just the laptop. But I take regular breaks out of my home office room to get drinks, snacks, check in on the the wife and kids

My hours are flexible so I don't rigidly stick to core business hours. I use time in the day for errands"
"I've been hourly remote worker for 14 years. Yes the four walls will start to close in. Take full breaks and lunches away from that desk. Get out of the house. With brick and mortar you have the drive home to decompress, maybe stop for a drink or get a pop. With remote you may need to actually leave the house after work for a mental health reset."
"My office is a shared space with my personal office. To draw the line between them, I switch between my work laptop and my desktop with a kvm switch. I have a nice monitor. While on my laptop, I am in work mode. I ignore most personal emails, while working.

My day is normally pretty close to a regular timed schedule. I like it that way, helps keep focused.

I do breakfast, sometimes I cook, sometimes I get drive thru once in a while, when I'm up early, I go and have a sit-down breakfast. Before going upstairs I always go outside on my front porch, normally a glass of water,.that's all I drink, take in some ""fresh"" air, then go and start my day. When ever I come down for.more water, I step outside for a few seconds just to take in some more toxic air. (These are not breaks. This is the same thing as the time it would take to go make a cup of coffee, or go to the break room and get a soda or something else. I don't normally take an actual break during the day. Then there's lunch, repeat the same thing.in the afternoon. When my day is.over, I sign out of my work computer, mute all sounds, switch over to my desktop and then proceed with my personal stuff.

To me it.is important that your personal things do not cross over into work, and work does not cross over into personal time. WFH does not mean you are working 24/7. WFH does not mean you can clean your house, do laundry, etc. I don't recommend doing that even on a break. If taking a break from work, take a break from ALL work. Go sit outside when you can without bursting into flames or be frozen solid.

At the end it is about finding what works for YOU! Take all the replies from here and try them out. Make your own routine. Try it, and adjust as needed."
What is your job? can you find good remote work without a bachelors or is it required?
"I do pretty much the same as you.

I was in an office for 10 years, but I have been remote for the last three. I have a room that is my home office. I go in there to work, and I stay the hell out when I'm not working. 
I buckle in at 7 AM and work. I leave at noon for hour or an hour and a half to exercise and eat lunch. Then come back and work until 400 or 430. 

If there are things I need to do, I get up and do them. That's part of the convenience of working from home. But I don't joke around with playing video games or washing my car or anything goofy like that. I work during work hours."
Loneliness is a downside of WFH that no one discusses.  My office is by a window.  I see street traffic and neighbors.  That breaks things up a bit.
"HSN is looking for remote workers but i think you have to be in Virginia, Florida, or Tennessee maybe Ohio as well. Only this is you have to be plugged up to the ethernet and that doesn't allow alot of moving around."
"With remote work, our day goes well and we do our work according to our own without any time limit and without any pressure.
This is the best way to do social mining, that's why people like it more."
I wish I could find remote work. You seriously asking how people go about their day?
"I totally feel you. When I first transitioned to remote work, I treated it much like a traditional office job too - sticking to strict hours, dedicating a space for work, and trying to keep everything as 'normal' as possible. Over time, though, I realized that one of the beauties of remote work is the ability to break away from the typical office mold.  
One of the things that has really helped me is moving around the house. Some days I work from my designated office space, some days from the living room, and if the weather is nice, I might take my laptop outside. The change of scenery does wonders for my mood and productivity. Also, there are ""place cells"" in your brain that encode locations, and they fire in novel configurations when you go to new places. So if your work requires creativity, consider working from cafe shops.  


Loneliness is a real struggle, I won't deny it. But I've found ways to combat it. I make a conscious effort to check in with my colleagues throughout the day, not just about work, but about their lives outside of it as well. We use a Slack and have channels dedicated to non-work topics. It's not the same as in-person interaction, but it helps."
Yeah I just gave up  I just accept that the only legit remote work that isn't a major call center are the ones that used to be in person until they switched during covid and most people have already been employed by those companies before they started working remotely.
"You're asking because you see remote work as not really working I assume? In all the jobs I've ever had, I've never worked harder. In peak season I work through lunch and don't even use the restroom. It's not easier I can assure you.

I was asking for ways to deal with the claustrophobia of being stuck alone in a room all day."
Tons of people would love to be in your shoes. Remote jobs are hard to come by. Seems like you're judgy about people's work-life balance and aren't really happy with remote work anyway. If you're an extrovert it probably isn't for you. Maybe give your job to someone who would love to work remote.
In that case I hope you find one! My lunch break involves me picking up my kids from school and dropping them off at the babysitter because they're too young to leave alone while I work from home. I can't wait for them to be old enough to stay home while I work!
I was only pointing out your own judginess towards other remote workers in some of the comments.  Parenting is neither here nor there. I'd say you signed up to have them so deal with it lol. Jobs can be quit though. It really did seem like you didn't like it. But you were being snarky to others about how they spent their work time.
"I think this is the key to remote working. If you're the kind of person who would enjoy being inside closed doors staring at a computer screen all day anyway, it's probably not an issue for you."
"My wording was literally: ""remote workers, what do you do to overcome this?""
Where did I judge them?"
"How to combat the loneliness of remote work? 
Just remember feeling your manager breathing on your neck, I think that will help you"
"If remote work makes you feel lonely, maybe you need an office job. 
Lack of face-to-face time with coworkers does not make me feel lonely; it makes me feel productive. 
I get enough social interaction with my friends outside of work. 
I work to make money, not friends."
"Exercising is a must for me as well, can't do without with remote work (especially if you're at home all day)"
"I could work from home for the entirety of my existence and not miss the office for one split second. I've been working remotely since 2020 and the only thing better would be not having to work at all. There's literally NOTHING I miss about going into the office. Never once have I missed anything about it. 

Besides, I've never been comfortable socializing with colleagues because my job is directly tied to my income. I will protect my income at all costs. I have friends for all my socializing needs. 

-

Having said that, yes. Sometimes it gets monotonous. Taking breaks, going for walks in nature, petting cats, etc. That all helps break up the monotony. 

Fuck getting up hours before it's actually necessary just so I can sit in traffic and smell other people's farts in the office. Fuck that noise and fuck any company who has mandated return to office."
"Your list is a good start, but from my experience, no amount of video calls or phone calls can replace face to face interactions.  Video calls are so artificial and since callers are in different environments, you don't share the same experience which play a big part in being human.

Here's my list:

1)  Work in the library or coffee shop.  I've gotten addicted to the library because I can get up and take a break and go look for some books.  You are unlikely to start talking to people unfortunately, but just being around other humans helps just a little.

2) Take a mid-day yoga class - I started yoga in 2019 and was crushed when 2020 rolled around.  Yoga is a great for combating sitting around all day, mental health, and being around other people.  

3) Volunteer - I've been volunteering for a radio station since 2018.  I've had some events happen during the work day, and I slipped out of remote work and did my volunteer work.  These events I do are super social and I find it so good for my mental health.  Most of the events happen at night or on the weekends, but I have had some during the day.

4) Find a hobby that requires you to be social.  -  I currently attended salsa classes a few times a week.  Most of them are at night, but there are some during the day.  I also do DJ classes online and have met up with some of the virtual students over the years I've been doing it.

5) Find a team sport - basketball, pickleball, tennis doubles, volleyball.  

6) Have a lunch date with your friends who also remote work - I've been bad about this.  I've only done it a few times since March 2020.  I am going to do it more now that I wrote this.  


7) Travel -  I've done a trip to Mexico and remote work and it was such a great experience living as a digital nomad for a bit.  If I did not have a GF, I would be traveling 70% of the time.

I like remote work, but wish my job was a bit more hybrid.  Ideally I would have a job that requires me to come in 1-2 a week.  But I'm not complaining with what I got!"
1:1s content can (and should) be adapted for remote work. It is a good channel to talk about any issues with working remotely.
"Be a regular at a spot for lunch. Seeing people not related to work can be a good break. It can also be costly.

If people go for walks in your neighborhood, join them. Good to know your neighbors anyway.

I have heard of people going to these places where you can go and work remote. Meet others there. Some are free to go to. (If you have lots of meetings I would not suggest that.)

Some local small coffee shops I have heard people going to and working. Also small sandwich places as well. Maybe some city center that has places outdoors is an option.

There is a website meetup.com that may have groups for people that WFH. Had one local to me that lasted two meetings.

Being able to be alone and not get ""board"" is important for working from home.

Maybe try one of those new AI bots to talk to....JK. Don't do that."
Great tips to tackle remote work loneliness! Connecting with peers and having team game sessions sound like fun ways to stay engaged and beat the isolation
"Im in Tennessee too and work from home but I don't know anything about you other than your state and there are millions of criteria that determine the work that you could do. For example education and work experience as a start... how would people know what you recommend you with no info?? Imagine you walked into a recruiter office sat down and said ""I'm looking for a job"" what do you think they would say next? What would you say??"
"I have had several years WFH (2016-2023).  I usually worked at least some on vacation as it was easier than coming back a crazy amount of emails and issues to deal with.  If I wanted to take some time completely off, I usually just did Mon/Tue or Thur/Fri, something like that.  It dramatically increased the amount of time away I had.

My son works for a company and is completely remote with unlimited time off.  He travels a lot and works during the day as he sees fit during his trips.  Even with unlimited time, you still can only take so much.  This allowed him to dramatically increase the amount of traveling he has done as well.

And for those wanting to know, no his company is not currently hiring . It was asked quite a bit in a prior post I put about his company."
"I am an avid skier so I will definitely be taking a PTO to go skiing but there is a limit to how much PTO you can take haha I would love to explore the opportunities working remotely grants and take advantage of the fact you can work as usual during the day, with the benefit of making the most of your free time."

"I am 100% eligible and covered by FMLA, yes I'm sure. I was eligible after only a few months where I am. I've never heard of third shift remote work, what would that kind of work look like?"
"this is more popular on the overemployed sub. remotework is a sub for honest work kiddo, you shouldn't post impure topics on a pure subreddit such as this to avoid unnecesary attention.  


I'm currently doing this somewhat but not the full job. A web developer contact me recently and hes signed up to freelance sites like upwork and even linkedin. Now some of these platforms are very strict, so I got a spare laptop for him to remote in from my house so it shows as working from my country. I occasionally attend a quick face to face meeting with clients but he gives me notes what to say.

And Im looking to get a 2nd job as a cloud engineer. I currently work in a NOC 4days on and 4 days weekend with occasional nightshifts. THe job is hybrid 70% wfh. Switching to cloud field from networks will likely me to get a ""junior"" cloud job for at least 6 months and most likely in the office. Anyway I will see what I can get, maybe a hybrid job mon-fri with 2-3 days a week in office. So I will do both jobs.

For that Im training a guy I went to school with right now. He also learned a bit for his CCNA long ago but onyl got the now retired icnd1 (1st half of the exams learning material). So basically. But stopped and then did a bunch of odd cleaner jobs until he went to gov job centre search, said hes stressed whatever, they gave him a bunch of papers. He filled them in however he did back then and found out they deviced to class him as handicapped. So now he gets retarded financial support. The gov pays his rent and gives him a few hundred a month to buy food. For the rest of hislife except that he cannot work anymore, otherwise he looses the benefit forever if starts working. So since I know him and hes already shown some capability to work in networks field of work, and hes financially starved, he super happy to train to do my job remotely and do all the shifts I cannot do like nightshifts becuase it would comflict with my cloud job, etc. I will just pay him my exact pay for those shifts I cannot do and bank the pay of those I do.

Oh my NOC job is relaxed I have multiple hours of downtime every single shift. Im also good at it so I can hack my way :) Even the weak retards on my team have this downtime of multiple hours on every shift. So yh, I can still a little more time by doing some work faster than most and sneakily claiming more time than needed on those shifts"
"Thanks for sharing and I think this is great advise for people that get lost when transitioning to remote working.  Agree with most of the points you make.

For my personal routine though, I never get the dressing up part that a lot of people recommends.  I guess I seldom need to video conference (most of my meetings don't require turning on camera), so I fully enjoy not dressing up when working remote.  To me when I get to my ""work"" desk, it's work time no matter what I'm dressed in.

Also, I don't feel working from home is lonely.  On the other hand, I love the lack of immediate distractions (co-workers coming to my desk to ask for something, especially something not urgent).  Those distractions disrupt my flow and I'll need to spend time to get back to the task.  When I'm working from home, at least I can delay replying to instant messages, slack messages, email... etc.

Anyways, I realize different people have different work style, so keep doing whatever works for you!"
"I started WFH around the same time you did (though I did WFH for 1.5 years at my previous company due to Covid) but unlike my last job I no longer receive phone calls.  It's kind of nice but also very isolating since my employer is in an entirely different state so I don't even have the option to come in if I wanted to.

I like a lot of your advice.  Something else I do is try not to use my office desk outside of working hours to maintain some separation between work and home.  I also like to work in different places sound my house to switch things up sometimes."
"Great information. I also WFH, but I lack a schedule, so my day goes around trying to put off fires."
"Any suggestions on getting started? 10 years of working experience, all retail and food. Looking to start WFH or remote work. I can grin fuck with the best of em, so customer service/support would be ideal. 

Problem I'm running into is most places are hiring for anywhere remote UNLESS you live in NY state (me) or, if they accept NY state you need a bachelors degree for $15-18 an hour

In food at the moment, as a manager, you make 16ish plus tips if your work allows it. On average I make around 20-21 but I can not deal with the people face to face any longer"
"Full genome sequencing might be found to be helpful to those on thread to understand how their unique genetics might interact with remote life.

Full genome sequencing with polygenic scoring can provide deep insight into various features of one's personal psychology that would seem of critical importance when considering the loneliness etc of remote work. People are different and offering generic advice across these differences is typically not helpful. Genetics now allow us to quantify these differences.  

My full genome sequence and accompanying polygenic scores offered me an enormous amount of insight into who I am. The information that can now be reported can provide pivotally important insights into which friends, mates, jobs, communities etc. would be optimal for you. When you look around and notice how often life does not work out for people, it should not be overly surprising to you now that you understand that people have typically never had the ability to probe the polygenic genomes of themselves or their mates. Using genetics to your advantage could profoundly improve the quality of your life and that of your family and friends.

There were many important and surprising findings from my genome sequence. For example, my full genome sequence had a GWAS polygenic score for the loneliness trait. I scored at the \~10th percentile. What meaning does a 10th percentile score in loneliness have? I **never** feel alone; **never ever**. I suppose it could be said that in social interaction terms I am quite low maintenance.

{Note: I genotyped through Nebula Genetics who offer a full genome service for \~$300 with dozens and dozens of polygenic scores provided. Over the near term full genome sequencing is expected to fall to \~$100.}

I think knowing one's polygenic loneliness score among others is of vital importance. I could well imagine that those who were not at the 10th percentile but closer to the 90th percentile on the loneliness score would likely have a very different psychological response to remote living. Genetics offers the potential to help people find their comparative advantages and thrive in those environments which value such traits."
Yes remote working alone in a foreign country is particularly tough.
Best bet would to start as data transcription or something similar. Look into easy to achieve certs because sadly your experience doesn't exactly translate to a WFH unless you could manage sales.

"Indeed & Zip Recruiter are the only sites I use. I've used so many others, but Indeed & Zip Recruiter are the only ones I'm able to use for remote work. Also - a major factor is I might be moving in less than 6 months, so I need a temporary & full-time job that needs to be out of state (since I'm moving to either Fort Wayne, Indiana or Omaha, Nebraska). Also - I stopped working in travel because I couldn't refer anyone (nobody was interested).

"Remote is good, but It will take some time to adjust, especially looking at where you're coming from. I think a few tips could help out:

**Dress like you're going to work**

When you wake up to work, you can dress just like you're going to work. This puts you in the work mood and motivates you as well. It kind of prevents you from instantly missing your office work environment.

**Get yourself a good workspace at home**

I can't stress this enough. A good table, chair, and work environment as a remote worker is something you should always start with.

**Remote doesn't mean you should only ""work from home""**

You may miss the commute sometimes. To deal with this, you can decide to work at a co-working space near you, a coffee shop, or from a park near. Remote means you have lots of options when it comes to where you work from - and It can help you move around a bit.

There are many tips, but these are just what I think could work for you too.

Thanks"
"I've been working remotely since 2009, I wouldn't trade this for anything, there is not money that could buy this freedom out of me!"
"Moving on from where you've been a long time is always scary, but honestly if they're telling you that you'll have to commute 4 hours a day 3-4 hours a week it's time to move on and they're lucky to have had that commitment. Working remotely will save you that time and that's worth time and money, but also sanity.

Even if you find you don't like full remote, that leaves you a lot more time to work out what you do want long term. I can't speak for you and your situation exactly, but I do know that not spending that much time on the road really helped me work myself out."
"You've been at your current job for so long, so it's totally understandable to feel mixed emotions about leaving. It's scary to leave the familiar, even if the new opportunity is really exciting. I can tell you're torn between the comfort of the known, and the excitement of the unknown.

Imo, I'd choose the Remote work. Same with alot of people here, Once i went remote i never looked back."
"WFH can be a life-changing opportunity beyond commute time. Once you understand your work obligations and are comfortable with your team and have shown  you're accountable, the goal should be to condense your work into focused ""deep work"" periods if at all possible. This efficiency could allow you to finish hours sooner and unlock much more time for yourself.  This way your chores are done, you're on top of your fitness, meals are made, and when the weekend comes, you have the time and energy to go somewhere and live more."
"If you worked hybrid it will be easier I believe, after leaving my job was missing some coffee talks, outside work conversations. Over time got used to it. As mentioned you still can go to some co-working and fill the gap. Discipline and other things related to work from home I believe with hybrid experience you have already felt."
"Everyone is different. I never imagined that I would enjoy working from home, especially when the pandemic hit and I was forced to work from home in a previous job where the expectations were steep and unrealistic and the leadership was not very understanding or supportive. I also did not at the time have an appropriate set up or resources to be able to work from home. Since then and since I shifted to a new type of position, in a new field and got myself set up with the appropriate accessories (desk, comfy office chair, printer, etc), I have enjoyed working from home and it has allowed me to take better care of my all-around health. I suggest setting a routine for yourself, keeping clear boundaries on work time, taking frequent movement/stretching/outdoor breaks (if you can)  and treating yourself to work accessories that make things more comfortable, easier and/or enjoyable for you to help in the transition."

"Oh yes, it's a thing.

We're all wired different. Some people find the occasional to and fro the office (provided is not a crowded public transport) refreshing, a chance to relax, and a way to transition from ""Work"" to ""Home"" and vice versa.

And for some people, being at home all the time working can become damn boring pretty quickly, so the commute kind of moves them around a bit (even though they can still do their own movements that don't involve commutes when working remotely).

I've only worked in the office for 4 months since I started my career - the rest has been remote. However, if I were to go back to the office, the only thing that I would like is sitting in a car and viewing the city landscape as I move from the office to home and home to office. So in a situation like that, I would definitely miss commute.

But it's not a reason to return to the office though. I'm just saying it's a thing.

I think there was a research on it sometime. Even though this was as a result of the general lockdown, there's some things in it that can apply to some people outside lockdown.

https://theconversation.com/people-are-missing-their-daily-commute-in-lockdown-heres-why-142863"
"Yeah, I understand. 

I've been working remotely since graduating from school (University) in 2016. I got a full-time, in-office job in 2018, and was pumped to try working in an office. I had to leave the company in the 4th month because I hated it, and since then, moved back to remote work. 

If I didn't find any remote jobs, I would do freelancing, and never took any office job. 

Personally, I just work anyhow, always from home. If I'm ever using a different space like co-working, then I'm probably visiting a friend or family members, who may not have a good home setup for me to work. 

But I see that other people are completely different. Some people find it difficult to work or get the motivation to work when alone, so they need some things in place to make the environment conducive."
I've been working remotely for over a decade and I've never put on nice clothes. I'm usually in my underwear lol... Not having to get dressed is a huge benefit in my eyes.
"By the way, please check out my blog, where I review remote work tools and write about the future of work. [https://worqstrap.com/](https://worqstrap.com/)

I'm not clear on how remote work increases your commute to daycare. I would switch closer in a heartbeat to save 2 hours a day of driving or there's no point in being remote.
"I would totally choose working remotely for your situation if I'm only considering the drive, not the jobs itself. Even though you need to drive to drop off your kids, you don't need to dress up, you get to go back home right after, or you can work somewhere nearby. There's much more flexibility wfh. You're gonna have to commute to drive your kids anyways no matter what school they go to. Albeit their current day care is further but only for another 1.5 years. If the only thing holding you back is the drive to the day care even though you're remote then i's definitely chose remote work. I will never go back to the office if i have the choice!!"
Yeah I was just about to say the same thing? Maybe it's a remote location and OP is confused on what remote work means for the rest of us?
"That's exactly why I'm soliciting feedback.  Is the only benefit of working remotely (to most) the benefit of no/little commute?  FWIW I would save time and money not having to wear business professional clothes / makeup / do my hair etc. every day.  I could workout over my lunch.  That sort of thing is where I see the benefit.  But the commute is a major downside, I agree.  We do not want to switch schools for our kids; it's the best in the city (other than one pre-school closer to our house, but they do not take infants, so my daughter cannot go yet)."
"""commute hits different when you're not dreading the destination"" - this is so true on random days I have WFH in my current role for a house repair or misc. other reasons.  The drive has not bothered me and I feel SO much more relaxed at home.  Of course, it's not the same as doing it every day."
"Thank you for the perspective!  I am leaning towards this, as well.  I think the remote job is better for my current work desires (more technically aligned with my skills), but could be a drawback careeer-wise because there is no presence in my city.  But I'm also an accountant so it's not like there's a shortage of jobs and the more I think about it I get so annoyed about dressing up to sit in my office all day staring at a computer .  It's great to hear from so many people who are loving remote work!"
"I don't have kids, so take this fwiw. I work from home. Previously, I was able to walk to my office (yay living in a city), so the commute wasn't a factor in my decision to change jobs. 

For me,  the major benefits of working from home are 1) I can do minor household chores (toss in a load of laundry, unload the dishwasher, etc) between meetings, saving me time in the evening and weekends 2) I don't have to get dressed up (pj bottoms!) saving on clothing and dry cleaning spend and 3) when I need to spend extra time on work, I can do it in the evenings at my leisure instead of staying late at an office. An extra bonus for me is I find in person time with others exhausting. Only you know if this move is right for you. Good luck with the decision."
"Also with kids it's so much more convenient to wfh. If they get sick you don't need to call off. You can attend their school functions, etc.  Also remote jobs are so hard to come by. More people want it and there are less opportunities so i would seize it if you can!  My work/life balance and mental health is so much better and it's been so good for my family as well. Good luck!"
"Yes, exactly - thanks :).  I am clear on what working remotely is, lol."
"Yes, exactly why I'm asking if the benefit of working remotely is worth it.  To be fair, it would not save me 2 hours moving to a closer daycare, which would still require 10-20 minutes drop-off time, plus 20 minutes driving RT as we do not live right next to a daycare.  So best bet would be 30 minutes am and pm, saving me an hour per day.  Not sure if you have young kids, but no matter what they're going to take up many hours of my day :)."
"This is great - thank you!  Your #3 comes in handy with kids, as well.  I can already do some remote work at home but I find I never take my laptop out of my bag.  If it were already set up in the home office I don't think I'd be as reluctant to catch up on a few things after the kids were in bed."
"*""I'm asking if the benefit of working remotely is worth it""*

Depends on what your priorities are.  For me, not having a commute is right up there at the top of the list.  Even when I worked in office, if the drive was over 10 miles I wasn't interested.

As the others have suggested, I'd find a daycare closer to home if that's an option."
"I'd suggest looking for a new job, things are about to get bad with the economy, not that they already aren't, and you being a newer guy as well as the one guy who's face they don't see everyday means your the first one on the chopping block. Also I'm all for remote work but I'm seeing a lot of entitlement here ie people are asked to come in for one day for some one off training or meet and greet and people are throwing fits"
"Sorry to say, but you sound entitled. You are fortunate that the company extended to you the remote work option. If they are hiring/ have hired 3 new people, then they may be softly in search of your replacement. You think you have power, you don't.

You don't make the rules but are required to follow them, prudently and with mutual positive regard. You need to go in to the office, play nice so that the top brass can see you are not as bad as they were told. They also need to see with their own eyes that the new hires can't hold a candle to you.

If you don't and with your piss poor attitude you will be out on your a** in less than 4 weeks.

How do I know? I run http://SearchRemotely.com with thousands of remote job seekers who would literally lie cheat or steal to be in your shoes. And at the same time its a platform for employers hoping to avoid  the liability and productivity loss and low morale of remote workers like you who can bring the company down.

There is an old adage. Your next hire should be better than your first, meaning its forced improvement through personnel hires. Chew on it for awhile."
"I'm seeing a ton of entitlement on this sub lately, you have a cushy remote job and your asked for one day to come in for a training session or to meet a CFO and everyone's like no I refuse, I'm remote. This is why remote working will come to an end, because whiny people are me me me and have no flexibility"
That's a completely separate issue from the issue of working remotely. Also part of my comments was just directed at people on this sub in general and not you
"Hi,

I'm not sure if anyone posted this yet, but I have been applying to jobs on a new WFH site.

I just created an account and was able to click the links in the job postings and apply. It's got a lot of good WFH leads and was free."
"hey! we have a free community called Remote Rise dedicated to helping people find remote jobs in tech. we post 100s of remote jobs weekly and sort them by different departments. We also have a content hub with different career paths, salary insights, etc. as well as mentor/peer groups, resume feedback, and networking opportunities. 

Feel free to join and would also greatly appreciate feedback! https://remote-rise.mn.co/

Myself and the other co-founder are both working remotely from Mexico too. We have a channel in there for travel related questions and would be happy to connect and answer any questions you guys may have!"
"Thank you for this, I too am looking for remote work so I can relocate to Mexico DF, after this coming summer! Requested an invite."
"That's just the nature of remote work. I think it fits people better who prefer to be alone. I prefer the remote environment over the classic office environment. I love the fact that I don't have to deal with office politics. Participate in the teambuilding meetings if you have them, we use the games on Zoom. Join a remote work club, or find other remote workers at cafes and libraries."
"I HATE the idea of someone ""popping"" in to ask a question so I just think it depends on your style. I like time to think sometimes and interruptions aren't great. I find my relationships are built organically through the work. We do have optional team building meetings and a social team chat though, which balances maybe. And we have off sites together 2-3x a year.

Though if we want to call a meeting to resolve an issue faster, we do, and we do have various meetings (weekly immediate team, monthly department, quarterly multi departments) already set, but we schedule to make it more efficient. I do better with an agenda and thinking time personally, but I'm an introvert.

Why not CC everyone on an email with the information before the chat or book a meeting with all parties if things need to be decided. As to a question, if it's not urgent, why not work on something else, and you definitely should have a phone number to call if it is truly time sensitive with big stakes? Maybe try and be more proactive getting info you might need if questions arise frequently?

Some of those are social aspects but some it just sounds like your work communication skills are lacking and you want a lot of guidance or struggle calling people together when it's actually needed? Also is there adequate documentation and planning? Remote work is all about proactive communication and planning.

As to the social aspect, that's a different issue others have addressed."
"This is all my favorite things about working remotely. I don't want anyone just popping into my office or pulling me into a meeting. No unscheduled chats. 

If I'm working then I am working.  Schedule some time."
"Depends on your work. I definitely understand your points, but none of the above mentioned are enough to be in office (for me), since most can be resolved remote. 

You need to book time on their calendar and typically it's full? Just book it and give them the option to propose another time.

Office politics? Who cares? That's a perfect reason to not be there. Why would you want or need to be involved in that?

Too many 1:1 meetings? Just do the same on teams (assuming you use teams at your work) you can legit pull people into calls. 

For me, work-relationships are built through doing the work. No need for extra effort outside of that tbh. I totally understand if you enjoy small talk with your coworkers. I'm just not one of them 

If it's something that cannot be resolved for you, then either WFH is not for you, or you have a position that really shouldn't be remote."
"Same situation. Not sure how long you've done it for but design your life around your job, remote work is the ideal situation if your life supports it. I'm in the process of building to that place but I see friends and family who are totally contented with their personal lives and would never want to give up 40 hours a week away from it to go into an office."
"I recommend setting up what you need a bit more. 

Yes, the nature of remote work. But set up a meeting if you think a meeting is needed. 

Randomly chat with people or do more personal stuff in the group chat. 

And definitely schedule random 1:1s! It's how you get to know each other. 

And request your boss does more virtual team events to get build the team culture. 

Remote work is still new. We are still figuring out what works best. But it seems you have some idea of what is missing. Don't expect others to see it. Pull more for what you think is missing."
"Hi, I had a similar experience when I started my first remote job.

>if my boss doesn't respond to my Slack, for example, I can only wait

If you are wasting time waiting for an answer, address this with HR or your manager. If you need an answer urgently you should be enabled to call. If this is not explicit in the company culture, ask to make it explicit or at least ask for a solution.

>I still have to ""book time"" on their calendars, which are often quite full already..making me hold back from asking

Maybe what I am going to say may sound too rusty, but I want to be honest. Holding back from asking is your problem. Not your colleague's. You are not responsible for your colleague's agenda: if they can make it to the coffee, good. If not, they'll decline and propose a new date. Drop the invite, try it, you don't have to play Tetris with their agenda. Or simply ask them: when is a good moment to have a coffee? I feel isolated those days and would love to catch up. I started doing it and people are SO happy to be reached out.

>A lot of times what could be resolved faster by pulling everyone into a meeting ends up becoming several hours of 1:1s

This is very inefficient. Remote work should enable more fluidity at work. If this situation is occurring address it with your manager, you have to work together on the company culture and on async communication skills.

>Have a tough time uncovering office politics

Same here, your remote working culture has to be written and shared with everyone so whenever you have an issue or you're not sure who to talk to, you refer to that document.

If you're in a small start-up, you can own those changes in the remote working culture. Have a look at GitLab remote working culture, take some inspo and bring it to your job: [https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)"
"Sounds ideal to me. But I'm intrinsically introverted. However, I do realize that some people have a rough time adjusting to remote work.

Here are some ideas that might work if the company owner or whoever is in charge permits:

https://www.supereasycrm.com/blog/virtual-team-building-games"
You won't get any answers or advice here because people are selfish and won't ever give up remote work. Sorry you're going thru this
That happens a lot. With remote work comes some benefits & drawbacks!
"My company uses  [Deskmy](https://deskmy.com/tb). It was well designed to solve any pain points of distributed teams like project management , loneliness and lack of communication. The meeting dynamics are amazing because you create and customize avatars, no screensharing bugs and distraction elements like gather and kumospace, chat channels work perfectly and app integration is also fine. It's like a 2D discord app, but remote work oriented. You should give it a try"
"Hey! That sucks!

  
The same situation happened to me a while ago, and it is really demotivating. But cheer up; you can do some things to improve this. I bet you are not the only one that feels that way.  
Working remotely can be pretty challenging sometimes, especially because of the lack of proper communication strategies and channels. But don't feel bad. I think that as long as you address this matter with your team, you can reach a common ground. 

I was facing a similar scenario with my company, and one of my teammates suggested this virtual office whose aim was to address precisely that issue. It is called Kosy Office, and I swear it helped a lot. [https://www.kosyoffice.com/](https://www.kosyoffice.com/) 

You can see if ppl are free to chat and just jump in a quick chat without the need to book a meeting or make a call, and it also has other great features that really come in handy for remote teams.

  
Hope this helps with your issue, and best of lucks!"
"Building on this, that's the nature of remote work. I couldn't stand that people could interrupt me willy nilly in an office, and love being able to reply after I've busted out a period of focus. If your business is of the type that you need instant responses from people, it may not be a good fit for remote work. If it's more that you would like instant responses, perhaps consider if you really do need an instant response or if a reasonable deadline/expectation for responding would work better."
"I've always been an introvert so I loved remote work at first, but now finding that the office politics doesn't disappear in a remote office...it just becomes harder to navigate. My previous fully remote company laid a bunch of people off, and a lot of the people who stayed were able to remain because they had the right relationships with senior levels. Interesting that you don't feel the office politics at play at all in your job"
"This is pretty spot on for pros and cons of doing work from home sales post COVID. I was a closer for Mogul Press back in late 2020, early 2021. They actually paid for my training with Elite Closers so take that as you will.

I was getting 12k/m with them but could never hit the 20k+/m goal I wanted. Just felt like it was hard to close people over the phone. On top of that, mid 2021 I was offered to work as a business partner with my brother in law @ his consulting firm.

Don't feed the haters OP!!! It's legitimate work and the 2 companies you listed are ones I've heard of being good if yall need that kind of boost. Unfortunately, with the way the sales environment is now a days, a lot of yall are quick to dismiss opportunities. At the end of the day, you choose what to do with your money right? I'm not shaming anyone because it didn't work for me. At least someone explains it in detail instead of spamming about it"
"The problem in many cities is if those commercial offices go under the small and medium banks that are throughout the country will go down too. A major portion of their money is tied up in commercial real estate. The businesses close, the banks close, the companies hiring people close. Then you will have no remote job let alone office job to go to. The high interest rates are going to bring down these banks sooner or later. With low interest rates they could kick the can down the road. Not anymore. 

If you weren't old enough in 2008 for a real recession get ready for the next one (we are not there yet). Gen Z it's your first rodeo. Get your emergency fund in order

There is a good side. Once the economy contracts and millions lose their jobs then I believe remote work will finally take hold moving forward. But there will be a lot of pain first."
"I like your opinion piece here. What I wonder is, how does your opinion hold up when the trends are showing a return to office gaining momentum and remote work opportunities drying up? "
"When you do not allow remote work...

You can only choose local talent-- the best local talent has remote jobs."
"I work at a large company as an engineer (20+ years of experience) and worked remote much of 2020 to 2022. I had to go into the office sporadically to use the big lab equipment; if possible, I also took some small lab equipment home to work with. I loved WFH!  
  
There are probably more but I only came across 2 downsides of remote work from an employee perspective:    
  
1. Extraverts: One of the engineers I work with is a super extravert (thankfully he knows how to restrain himself from talking too much). He went into the office often (even though almost no one was there) just for the slim chance of face to face human interaction. He said he needs in-person human interaction (probably as much as I try to avoid it). 
  
2. Mentorship: Interns and fresh out of university engineers told me it was really difficult during those WFH years since they didn't get in-person mentorship. When we all started to work back in the office, they told me they liked it much better from a mentorship perspective.  
  
There might be solutions to the above issues but since those didn't concern me directly I didn't try to solve them."
Remote work will be used as an incentive for people to meet goals/quotas. Below average performers and average employees require supervision and coaching. It's control and a way to reward good performers.
Let me add to what you say. Why do some companies that refuse to allow remote work then go and outsource work to other countries? Isn't that remote? Lol
"Yeah no one wants to be in a cubicle area with everyone on webex, talking loudly so that the people on the call can hear you.  And everyone else in the area can hear you too.

Introverts like me work better at home, without having to deal with social interaction that drains me.  Extroverts probably enjoy the physical human interaction.

Some people need quiet areas to focus on their work.

Some people prefer to be faceless so that less judgement is passed.  You aren't discriminated against based on color, gender, physical appearance, size of your body, how you look and dress, etc.

WFH allows people who need to take kids to school/daycare or pick up, the ability to do so.

And if you speak to other countries, you're basically working remote.  If collaboration truly requires physical presence, then why work with India and other countries?  

And really ""collaboration"" should be in air quotes.  Boeing has no clue how to collaborate.

Honestly, the push to move things to India is really a concern for me.  My husband works for another company that set policy that you can only hire those who live in India.  This is definitely a move to downsize the US workforce, who aren't valued for their abilities, culture, etc., and who are looked at only as $$$ and aren't considered for abilities.  My husband said that you can get 3-4 project managers in India for 1 project manager in the US.  Throwing resources (esp from another country) at things doesn't always result in fixing things.  And all that IP to another country - we obviously did not learn from China.  I would not be surprised if Boeing gutted the US workforce for other countries like India.  Boeing - who gets bailed out by taxpayers and pretty much has a monopoly on DOD (the move to Virginia is a nod to that) - should not be allowed to to hire/outsource so many jobs to other countries.  Btw: Daveyboy made a deal with India that wasn't favorable to Boeing just to increase the number of airplane orders.

Sorry for the above paragraph soap box.  It is related to WFH because we still have to communicate with other countries which will start to be more frequent.  So, no physical interaction with those not in the US.  And I feel bad for US workers who have managers in India. How the hell does that even work?  And are these people in this situation feel valued or feel like they can talk to their manager for HR type questions."
"Yet somehow businesses have survived forever only being able to get ""local"" employees in the office to work for them. Sure, lets scatter our remote employee pool all over the world. An absolute pipe dream based on employee protections and the differing rules of law/ tax rules over these same people state to state and country to country that only the largest corporations can currently overcome. Not to mention, it will be YOUR job that gets eliminated when your dreamtopia worldwide work environment boss finds out that an employee of equal capability in India can do your job for 1/3 of what you make...plus no mandated health insurance to boot!  Bye, bye to everything you had, but I am sure you will still feel satisfied that your ex-employer achieved your ""powerful"" worldwide WFH goals you so desire."
"Speaking as a genxer who desperately wants to continue work from home, can y'all move your asses up soon? Thanks!"
it's abundantly clear a lot of the resistance to WFH is really just boomers who shouldn't be in positions of power any more. you can tell because their strategies aren't really working. it's only a matter of time until we win.
"It's post-COVID adjustment. Everything went remote during the pandemic, now many managers want to switch back and the current situation favors employers over employees. But remote work has been steadily growing for over a decade now. I also think that many companies that are going back to the office now will slowly transition back to remote work, especially in fields where skilled employees are in demand. 

I work in foreign language education and I went remote during the pandemic. Around 2022, the university I was working for wanted to switch back to in-person with hybrid for a few roles. I quit and found a fully remote job in a country with higher salaries. Last I heard, all roles that could be done remotely were switching to remote, in part because the university was hiring more and more foreign contractors that they could pay less. 

Of course, it also follows that remote work will likely mean a decrease in expected salary for employees in high-earning cities and regions, especially in countries that are open to foreign contractors."
"And a decrease makes sense too! I would take a 20k paycut for full time wfh if I wasn't already wfh. 

You'll spend 10-20k on:
Maintenance gas and miles
Access to food 
1-2hrs a day waiting in traffic we don't get paid for 
Clothes/Dry cleaning/extra laundry 
Ear buds because Carl won't stop eating chips and he's too fat to breath through his nose 
Medication and ""necessities"" for your mental health. (outings etc) 

There's a ton more but you get the idea"
Yeah I don't even think it is specific to Boomers. I think there will be things our generations don't understand when we are at the top but I do think WFH is something they are as a group not willing to accept

"Focus on the mission. Find ""culture"" outside of work. When I was in the office, most of my team was two states away. So I never got to see them in person anyways. Even with people returning to the offices; a lot of them are just sitting in cubes on Teams meetings all day. And my org might make us all schlep back to the offices, for this ""work culture"" that you are missing now. And I don't think it's worth it, to lose remote work for."
"Yeah. I've found that I do better in companies where most people are remote. Then the culture is built around the notion that no one is in the office. If you're one of the few remote workers in an organization, it's really easy to become isolated and left out."

"I know very well how work visa's work, as I have received work visa for four different countries throughout my life. You don't need a work visa to work remotely in another country. For example I have been interviewed by American companies, being paid through their bank in US, for remote working in UK. I have also been interviewed for a company whose work force was 100% international, people working in all continents and been told in interview that it didn't matter where i was based. I have also been paid to work remotely from a Chinese company even though I was based in the UK. So what's your point?"
">\>You asked for advice on getting a remote job, then talk about a US job  
\>You are told, ""This only happens if you're somehow a very high demand candidate for a job that has no other US-based applicants.""   
\>You say 'not necessarily' and start arguing semantics, ignoring the point made that companies would rather not provide a work visa than provide a work visa; as many companies are not set up to do this and that you're better off looking within your own country for Remote work  
  
>  
>What's not to get?"
"Wish I had the answers. Been looking for remote work for over a month on indeed, no bites."
"This.

Lookup ""remote customer service""

A whole plethora of jobs out there in that industry.

Pay is not always great and expect to eat a daily dose of  from customers... But eventually you'll get used to it.

Hey, it's remote work."
"You could also look for some seasonal positions if you are ok with call center work (if you can handle that temporarily, they might not come with benefits). 

Idk. That's what I am doing right now. Obviously while looking for other positions that are permanent. I feel like I am at least getting a feel for it coming from more traditional work, and I feel like it ensures that I have the right equipment, internet requirements, etc, for other remote work. I just started a week ago, so I am still a novice lol."
"Good luck in your search! I have no advice but would you mind telling me how you got diagnosed with eoe? My sister is very sick and the Drs can't figure out what is wrong with her. I researched eoe and she has all the symptoms.

Oh I might have a bit of advice, I have a friend who WFH doing medical billing. She doesn't have a degree & it doesn't appear to need qualifications to start."
Thanks! Yes we verify for wifi and a home office not just sleeping and living accommodation so we going more niche. They are very successful though and have set the trend. Hope it was a positive experience for you. Thanks.
"Most wfh customer service jobs require child care because you're on the phone and will be unmuted for the most part. You also have meetings to attend so trust me, I wanted the same thing but it's been tough. My family hates it because they're walking on egg shells not making noise because my job requires me to be unmuted. If you want to be home with the kids, look for something that doesn't require talking like chat or data entry"
"You're not going to be able to do a phone job while taking care of two babies unfortunately. You will need a sitter or mothers helper at least. You're gonna have meetings and trainings you can't miss and those babies don't really care about your work schedule lol. I would think of a different option .. maybe a sales job where you can make your hours .. work from home really isn't a way around childcare, it's a real job just with the location of being home. Think if it like this, if you can't bring the baby to the office for this job then prolly can't do it at home while taking care of them either."
"Hi,

I shared a post in here a few days ago about a new website that post daily WFH job leads. 
I was able to create an account and apply to the links in the job posts. I didn't have to pay anything.

I hope this helps!"
"It will depend on the job and employer. For example, my current job was through LinkedIn and the company is based in Munich, but I work for the Spanish office. That doesn't make any difference for someone who can work anywhere in the EU, but it could make a difference if you're only authorised to work in one member nation. Also, my understanding is that I could technically work from anywhere, but tax, etc. might be a problem especially with perks such as private healthcare. Then, it doesn't matter if I decide to move to Australia, I'd still have to be available during Spanish/German working hours even if that's a night shift where I'm located 

But, generally some employers are open to global recruitment, some will want someone based locally but not allow remote working. If they don't advertise which, you'll gave to ask them."
"I did that before covid, I lied and said my commute wasn't practical - I am more ""effective and efficient"" if I work from home day X,Y,Z my boss said fine and I was a hybrid before it was even a ""thing"". I did NOT go into details - I don't have a kid or anything to ""blame"" either. It's none of their business *why,* swing the whole conversation based on your performance and productivity be an actor or actress if necessary for your freedom..."
"The key is to clearly communicate the benefits not just to you, but also to the company. A big argument I used was the potential for increased productivity. I explained that while the office environment has its merits, it often comes with its fair share of distractions, which can hamper focus and productivity.  


 I also pointed out that time saved from commuting can be utilized more effectively (hours, seriously hours). This doesn't mean working longer hours, but having more time to recharge and come back to tasks with renewed energy.Another angle I found helpful was emphasizing my ability to manage my own time and tasks effectively. I showed examples of past projects where I demonstrated self-discipline and time management, key skills needed for remote work  


.I also brought up how working from home can reduce overhead costs for the company, as they would spend less on utilities, office supplies, and even real estate in some cases.  


And the one interesting thing is to propose a pilot: proposing to work from home for a month or two so we could actually see if the arrangement worked. It's important to clarify desired outcomes and all of that. This gave my employer confidence that the change could be reversed if it didn't work out."
" I think the points you listed are enough reasons. 

Maybe you have to find a better way to present them, but these are great reasons. 

You might also want to add some points about how it benefits them, including you getting more ""alone time"" to focus adding to your productivity and boosting the company output, not using company resources like electricity and water during work, which reduces the company's overall monthly bills (you can add these if your boss is really picky). 

Otherwise, a good boss should allow you work remotely when you request it and they see that you are productive working remotely too."
"I think you are going from the wrong side of the street. You are saying why it is a benefit for you. Companies don't care. How will it benefit the company? ""I am more productive WFH because I have less distractions than in the office. While I will miss the in person collaboration, it will open up another desk in the office."" Etc."
Look to see if there is an office where you are moving too. Say you will transfer to there and just phase out going to that office and no one will know. Lol. That is what I did. Then they shut down the office eventually and I was moved to wfh permanently.
"Keep it simple and to the point. Here's why: you are moving to a new state anyhow. So your boss knows you will either 1) work remotely, or 2) have to leave the company. If you're good at your job, they'll want to keep you... regardless of what it says in the justification letter.  


With that said, I submitted your premise to Chat GPT to write it. This could be your first draft and you could edit it for your voice:  


Subject: Request to Transition to Remote Work  
Hi \[Boss's First Name\],  
I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed last week, I'm planning to move to \[New State\] in the upcoming months due to some personal circumstances. While this decision wasn't made lightly, I firmly believe that my move can be turned into an opportunity for both of us, with the possibility of my role becoming fully remote. I'd like to present a few reasons why this could be advantageous for both of us:  
\- Increased Productivity: Numerous studies have shown that employees often find remote work to be more productive.  
\- Cost Savings: Reducing overhead costs for utilities, office supplies, or other associated on-site expenses can be a bonus for the company. While it's a small drop in the bucket, every bit counts!  
Retention & Morale: It's no secret that I'm truly passionate about the work we do at \[Company's Name\]. Being able to continue my role, despite the move, would not only be a tremendous morale booster for me but also ensures the company retains an experienced team member.  
I completely understand that this would be a transition not just for me but for the team as well. I'm committed to ensuring that the changeover is as smooth as possible and that there's no dip in the quality of my work or communication levels.  
If there are any reservations or concerns, please let me know. I'm open to a trial period to see how this arrangement pans out or any other suggestions you might have.  
Thank you for considering my proposal. Looking forward to discussing this further.  
Warm regards,  
\[Your Name\]"
Good strategy. It should give a benefit for the firm not the employee. Benefits of remote work for employees are just external communication for firm (we help your people to feel better because we are a fantastic company).
Remote work for me :) even though I'm on a hybrid now and remote work can be lonely sometimes :/
Assurance allows you to work from home selling life insurance if you are licensed.
"I'm not sure if you're asking a question or stating a point 

Yes, it depends on the company. Some will allow global remote work because their finances allow for it. Others may not, because they don't have the capacity to deal with the different taxes. If the company does not hire for the country you live in - then you simply can't work for that company.

Your post was asking how companies can post remote work but require you to be from the US correct? I was responding to that, explaining that remote doesn't usually mean globally remote. A lot of companies will state remote but they mean ""not working from our physical office building"" and not ""you can work from anywhere including internationally"" *

I saw someone else point out sponsorship for non-US citizens - this is another point I didn't mention. Sometimes companies don't have the capacity to fund sponsorship for employees; a lot of big ones do but some smaller ones don't, especially is majority of their employees don't require it."
"Remote work isn't a career you can switch to. Look for work that matches your skill set and see how much of it is advertised as remote. Or look at job openings that are remote and try to build skill sets that match demand (and interest you.)

I know teachers and therapists who only do virtual (remote). And of course my field -tech - has been super-remote friendly since the before times. But I wouldn't advise trying to get into tech now unless it's your lifelong dream."
"You sound insane to me. No disrespect. 

Commuting. Wearing clothes I hate. Make up. Hair. Food and bathroom breaks. All of my work is solitary or online meetings anyway. 

It's simply a waste of my time.

My home office is better than any office concept I ever had. Please. I invested in this."
"This is a great topic! I first wanted to point out that working remotely post-pandemic when the alternative was not being able to work at all is *completely different* from working before or after the pandemic. 

During the pandemic, I did everything online and developed cabin fever and anxiety. But before the pandemic and now, I only do my day job and freelance work online. Everything else is in person. I participate in community events, work out, attend dance class and pilates, eat brunch, and am in 2 book clubs. I also have a workstation in my home that's only for work. When I worked in person, I developed the bad habit of eating at my desk but now I eat in my kitchen and then go outside - to walk around the block or to run an errand.

To answer your question, I have coworkers who live alone. One of them loves it because she's been able to live in a gorgeous place without family or roommates for the first time. She has a large friend group outside of work and travels quite a bit. It seems like there's always a wedding, birthday party, family reunion, or baby shower on her calendar. 

Another single coworker who is an expat and doesn't have family in the UUS wanted to work in the office as much as possible. She also said she learned better in person. When she was first hired, she went into a nearby office quite a bit but then confided in me that being in the office with random people not on our team wasn't helpful. After nearly a year on the job, she admits that remote work has been better for focusing on projects but she still craves in-person experiences. 

The heart wants what it wants. If you prefer to work in person, it's fine if remote work isn't for you. There are tons of jobs that aren't remote. I would also point out that if you're the lone in-person on a mostly remote team, you won't likely get the experience you want. I'd recommend looking for roles where in-person collaboration is valued."
"If you feel it's not right for you, don't do it. What advocates are pointing out is that some people feel _exactly how you describe_ about going into the office. It shouldn't be a one size fits all. We're not mindless automatons that are carbon copies of each other. Different people, different teams, different industries, need different things. The return to the office crap across _all_ sectors is making the decision for us, trying to coerce everyone into the same patterns again, amplifying the unhealthiness for many people, instead of having a genuine conversation about what work patterns are most efficient and productive for each person and team.

In other words: no one is saying you should _have_ to work remote. Just, we also shouldn't _have_ to work in an office either. Do what makes sense.

One thing I will ask though is about loneliness. That is absolutely a valid concern. everyone needs friends and to be social. I would ask though: why does that social interaction _have_ to be at a workplace? Could it not be that you have more time without needing to commute, etc, to attend local social events around work hours? Try to find a hobby you like then look for groups doing it. Volunteer picking up trash or for any other reason to meet folks in your community. Remote work doesn't imply or require folks have to be shut ins and never talk to people, that's silly. Socialize with your coworkers remotely via chats and casual video conferences over lunch for example, and when you need in person contact then find hobbies to meet people with the extra time you reclaim from not needing to commute and do special workplace related chores.

But of course if you still feel best about being in an office, go ahead and do it. You should be happy. You'll still find jobs that want that or prefer that. Consider branching out or learning a new skill to find those jobs. If you hate the idea of remote, then please don't do it. Let the rest of us that love remote do it; we won't be applying for the in person jobs, so you'll have more options of what you want if we have more options of what we want."
I would bet on Hawaii being the most difficult state to find remote work in. Based on my job search experience living here looking for a remote job at least.
"I worry about this too. Remote veteran as well. Remote work is a great perk, but everyone still deserves pay equity for their experience."
"That's frustrating. I would love to work from home but not be on the phone. I did that and ended up having to quit due to a mental breakdown with the stress of it, and have had horrid anxiety ever since"
"I do WFH non-sales making 50k a year in the medical industry talking to people in the phone between 30-90min conversations, at first it very intimidating being on the phone but you get used to it fast 

if you get one for $15 accept it and keep looking for better job , it a very competitive market for talent"
"If you're general computer knowledge is pretty good you can apply for QA-WFH positions where you test new features and find bugs. Most of the time you will have to speak maybe a total of an hour a day (giving updates, asking questions) but most of the time could be done through slack/Teams

So if you wanna look at something else that's non-phone look for Quality Assurance positions."
"Generally speaking high skill jobs you do on a computer are the easiest to find remote work in. Obviously software is the main one, but I even know a couple lawyers who work from home now."
I know some companies will require a specific internet connexion (due to systems not working on wifi for example) but I have never seen a company requiring a phone line for WFH positions.
"Indeed and LinkedIn
I use search terms such as
""remote""
""work at home""
""work from home""
""virtual""

"Check amusement parks. They always need like guest services people? Just double check that they don't have a requirement like 'need to be under 200 miles away from Disneyland'

"You guys should really check around. I work for a f500 and make $70K a year as a supervisor. My employees all make a minimum of $42K a year and it is a phone job. Full benefits, WFH."

"No worries! You have to protect yourself and I'm sorry you've had to deal with that on here. Thanks for the info, I have come across some insurance related position on my WFH job search, will look more into them."
"I gave you the industry. Most competing companies match our industry standard of pay. Look at insurance agencies with large corporate offices near you and visit their website. Apply for all the positions that offer either hybrid or WFH, and the websites all clearly list the paygrade and pay scales they use, depending on your experience and interview. Good luck with your future job search!"
I currently work as an application support specialist full time but I have fibromyalgia and commuting to and from work is difficult. I live in Trinidad.  Where can I find online jobs so that I cud work from home?
I saw one on Indeed for a remote work from home warehouse job. Must have forklift licence.
"It's to get hits. I noticed this earlier on during the pandemic, too. Jobs would mysteriously change their terms once you started looking in further through their descriptions, or if you managed to get ahold of someone, their spiel would make no mention of remote work or make absolutely clear that the position was in-office/onsite."
"Maids. Work from home
Really. I've seen offers like that. No joke"
"I live in Alaska, and people here have been using the term 'remote job' to mean 'in the middle of fucking nowhere' for decades. So when I search for remote work, half the stuff that comes up in a job is some village like 400 miles away. 'Must be willing to fly regularly', that kind of stuff. Or something like, room and board is provided in a cabin with no shower or toilet, but an outhouse."
I've gotten waaaaaaay too many for remote work that strangely requires specialized trucking licenses. I wish there were easier ways to report listings that lie about that kind of thing.
Indeed auto select's  remote work when creating jobs adverts for some dumb as reason.
"I'm guessing recruiters/companies are slapping the word ""remote"" on their job listings so they get lots of views/applications, since remote work is really trending. 

Still frustrating to see it applied to jobs that clearly aren't remote though...i.e. mail room jobs, warehouse jobs..."
"Yep. I see this a lot in IT. A ton of IT jobs post as remote until you get to the first interview. Then maybe once every 3 weeks or so, you can work from home. But the rest of the time no..."
It happened to me a few years ago around 2014. Looking up remote jobs. Applied. Got a call to interview and then was asked when I would be moving so I could start  It does seem a lot more prevalent these days though with everyone trying to work from home.
"I love the ones that are tagged as ""remote"" or ""work from home"" and then you read it and it actually says ""THIS IS NOT A REMOTE POSITION"" further down "
"There's been a lot of companies saying remote for now but going back to the office at some point. 
We've been in this pandemic for almost two years, you'd think people would cut the sunk cost of the overhead of offices and just let people work from home at this point. I know not EVERYONE can do that, but there's a high number of businesses that can and just have old hat management that can't seem to adapt. IMO, this is also why businesses are failing left and right."
"Employers really want to hold on to the old ways. The govt office I work for is 100% ICT, 95% remotely doable. The 5% is when one of the very rare physical servers has a disk that needs swapping or something. Anyhoo, during the short hiatus in covid cases they reminded us right away that ""remote work is not a right"" and wanted everyone back at the office.

As it is a govt office, it can't really compete when it comes to salary. And there are many remote ICT jobs around. Guess what happened?"
"Well they also get hits if people looking for remote work in their own city. I don't think it's worth the hassle of sifting through, especially when the people they are reaching don't want to work onsite. Totally agree with you it's a waste of time."
"We've covered this one. Field work is the original remote work. You don't have to go into the office. Like Shipt or Uber, they are remote because they never have to go into an office. Phlebotomists, home care nurses are big on this one too. That's a line between working remotely and working from home."
"> Field work is the original remote work

Late to the thread but you are absolutely correct. Remote working before pandemic to my understanding is pretty much any field job simply because you're not an an office 100% of the time lol.."
"Agreed my first WFH job was customer service for a retail company which I thought was a blessing at the time but kind of destroyed my mental health. I would advise people to look at glass door and better business bureau reviews before accepting an offer. The company I was hired at was being run poorly and too focused on the bottom line. So my day would consist of answering back to back call for 8 hours with a lot of angry people swearing and threatening me or some weird ones making lewd chat comments towards my fake profile picture. I stayed there a year too long and would have rather just worked at subway and used the rest of my time to learn skills for something better, never again."
"I work as a medical typist - still go into the hospital/office but also get to do some pure 'typing days' at home. The only reason I have to go in, realistically, is because my hospital is yet to welcome the year 2022 and still uses paper notes. If they digitised medicine like some other Trusts, I could fulfil the role almost entirely at home.  


We have massive staff absences in the NHS too due to people taking the absolute piss with sick leave - so we often need to procure the services of third party transcribers through companies such as Dict8 and Accuro. If you can get some transcribing experience (I started with Rev freelancing before joining the NHS) and consult for one of these companies, you can make a decent earning at home that matches your output/time invested.   


When I work from home typing I barely feel like I've been working... I find it quite relaxing typing doctor's Cardiology letters for 10 hours straight in the comfort of my home. I realised it is because the commute to/from work and the extra money spent, the countless people I see outside just stresses me out. As a massive introvert being able to work from home 1-2 days a week, most weeks, has helped so much."
"Lol I worked for conduent early 2020 to see what working from home is like, and I couldn't find many other WFH jobs. Terrible job. Lasted like 3 months or so and just quit. Terrible, entitled customers, unorganized management, high turnover, dinosaur computer, terrible computer programs smh. Only paid $11 too. Never again. Lol I still have their stupid dinosaur computer that I need to send back to them."
"Everything's relative, right? Giving up a good in office job for a lousy wfh job might be a bad move, but one of the companies you noted vs. an in person service job might be different. At least with wfh the jackass customers can't cough on you."
"I worked very briefly for Radial via a temp agency/recruiter. After having to change the company I was going to be doing call center for when they ignored me saying I wanted to give two weeks notice of my status change at the job I was at (and am still working), I went to pick up my equipment only to find out all the pickups for that day had been canceled, and no one told me. Still managed to get my equipment. After wholly inadequate training, I had system issues that took two hours to resolve. Two days later, same issues, two hours to resolve, but weren't resolved completely. Radial told me I need to call the agency, agency told me to call Radial. I was fed up, emailed my resignation to my recruiter, and asked where they wanted their equipment sent. Several days later I got an email asking if I had picked up my equipment...

Suffice to say it gave me a bad impression of work from home, but maybe if I could find something that isn't call center, I'd give it another try."
"In the U.K. and just quit my 40 hour WFH job that was MEANT to be accounts and finance, I lost an accounting job due to lack hours during covid, thought this would be great . 

They wanted me to ""help out"" with residential which mean I was now working residential for a energy company client. Terrible no time between calls, not enough training, customers screaming at you, and a quality assurance team marking your calls as well.  Really nearly broke me. 

Start a new part time accounts job next week (I have young children so it's a better balance) 

Please never take one of these terrible jobs, unless you aren't fazed by long hours, bad pay and constant abuse"
"I'm only afraid to do WFH jobs because i need to pay taxes and TB or whatever that called, so I need the job to pay me and pay for my taxes too (like a real job do)"
"Even though my work has a hybrid policy and allows us to work from home on Mondays and Fridays, I go in every day as I get too distracted working at home. I don't know if I could handle a fully remote position at work. 

While it's nice being able to wake up right before I work, I don't have the discipline to stay focused working at home. Not to mention I live in a studio. This is just me though. I know some people work better from home."
">Agreed my first WFH job was customer service for a retail company which I thought was a blessing at the time but kind of destroyed my mental health.

That was why I had to quit Conduent. My mental health was plummeting and I needed to get the fuck out. It was such a bad job. At the same time I'm glad I had the experience because it gave me a new threshold for bullshit I can put up with in a job lol."
"I'm in the process of applying for disability through like, a firm. They won't charge me unless I get disability and they'll take like a 6th of the backpay. Fine with me because I'll have disability. I'm mentally destroyed. Exhausted. Appen wasn't consistent for me either. One WFH job that was consistent for me in the past was Lionbridge. No idea if they're still around. One thing that did suck is it was all about accuracy and since my brain is so stunted from derpession, I wasn't accurate."
"Apply for Transcom, it's work from home. I've literally heard nothing but god reviews from people who have worked their ."
"Lol same, it really changed my mentality from work from home no matter what to being more selective of where I applied."
"Thank you so much for the kind words! And of course, thank you for thinking I'm interesting enough to follow! 

I mostly write about entrepreneurship, remote work, and self improvement. Plus pictures of my cat."
This is great. Keep going! I am currently employed but see myself looking or remote work soon. This is a niche that someone had to fill and I like the design and navigation so far.
"This is great to find!  I can""t drive, so would prefer remote work."
"Awesome work! 
Btw on Indeed.com there are tons of jobs listed as immediate work/remote work and they're tagged as such so you can look up who and where is hiring ASAP."
I work remotely for QVC network and we are always hiring for CSRs! It's $13.25 an hour with full benefits starting out. There's a pay increase every three months. At the end of this year I'll make $18 working remotely from home.
"i know that remote work is from home, but do they accept people outside of the US?"
"Yes! Even though it is saying that it's not remote, all QVC positions are currently remote work from home !"
"This is the second post I've seen about this. No fucking way.  It could be argued that it's no different than being in the office where people can see you but it absolutely is.  In the office, you can at least see if people are actually looking at you or not.  Sometimes I just have to pick my nose or my ass.  Maybe I just need to fart or burp really loud.  But I can tell if it's ok or not.  Am I supposed to get up and leave my desk every time I have the simplest bodily functions?  That's not suspicous?   

I won't even turn on my GoogleHome camera because my home is my sanctuary where I shouldn't have to worry if & when someone is looking at me.  

I've WFH for over 10 years, maybe I'm old-fashioned?   I put in a full day of quality work, maybe more.  I answer calls, emails, messages quickly.  I'm never MIA. I realize many people do not do that and I understand why companies would want to monitor activity, but they need to bring people in the office to do that.   OP seems to have a job with sensitive security, which I understand.  But after all these years, I'd go in every day before I had a camera pointed at me all day.  The only other option is my salary x 10 and maybe I'll think about it."
"I'll comment on this rather than the post as I saw the post mentioned by the comment you responded to.

At home remotely on a personal computer it's a bit iffy so I see where you're coming from. But in my line of work if you work from home you need a specific work computer at home separate to your personal one. 

My career is in government telecommunications and I worked on two federal contracts before moving to state level because it's a bit more lax.
And basically in my mind, the computers I'm on at work, are key logged and fully monitored and the screen  is recorded for QA purposes as they watch the video of your call to qa you.

When having meetings with people WFA(work from anywhere) camera is expected .

But if you're fully remote it's becoming the norm and it's extremely normal to have work computers tapped like that. 

So with all that being said the absolute best thing you can do. Is email your tech admin, ask for the minimum specifications of what they accept on a computer to work from home.  Then go buy or build yourself the cheapest possible one that meets the specifications,  to have a work only computer. 

But they are power tripping with the violations and desk requirements,"
"As a person who suffers from bipolar, adhd, PTSD, and considered misanthropic, I definitely understand how you feel! There are high paying jobs that you can work from home. I've been working from on and off for 20 years.   I have been an employee for almost ten years as a chat advisor at a well known computer/mobile corporation (anyone like fruit?) and the benefits and work life balance is great. I'm paid more than $25/ hourly although No job is perfect ( I'm burnt out from chat support and my general disdain for all things human grows more with each passing day).

Right now I'm taking courses in SQL, excel, Tableau, and Python (that they pay for) so I can get a position that is more on the backend and away from customers as far as I possibly can. 

Anyway, Indeed, Flexjobs, simplyhired, rat race rebellion, are where most legitimate jobs are posted. You can also visit company websites and their career page. Type in ""remote"" in the search bar and positions will pull up if available!"
"I have chronic depression & fatigue and have a hard time with in-person jobs, but I've been working for the past few months as a remote Ecommerce Assistant, and it's been great! The only social interaction I have is a 10 minute zoom call with my boss each morning, but we both leave the camera off lol. The rest is all Google chats with other employees. If you're not into commerce, I have a friend who works remotely doing research for a company studying rare diseases.   
Working remotely with little social interaction is possible, you just have to find the right role. There's some good stuff on Indeed but watch out for all the spam/fake posts. Good luck!"
"First of, thanks for sharing list which would help a lot of job aspirants at this difficult time. 

I'm just curious to know about your profession and your area of interest.

I have read many blogs and articles about people working remotely from places like Bali, Thailand and other tourist destinations.  I would like to know what kind of jobs will allow one to work remotely and enjoy the life at same time."
"I have never seen any work from home jobs that would let you work from Germany personally. That's probably based on my skills currently though, what kind of job does your boyfriend currently do?"
"Taxes will be an issue. He has a German work visa?

Honestly, working remotely for a German firm in English may be easier."
"You are having a hard time right now, you can't possibly suck at everything. You are in a bad spot right now. Getting a decent work from home job can be really tough. The testing is intense, the amount of applications you put in is insane and you hardly get a response from anyone. Trying to find your niche can be difficult. As others have said look into what interests you. See if you can use something you are passionate about. As you said, you are good with E-bay. That is definitely a positive. Maybe hit up local auctions and yard sales to make the e-bay thing generate more income. You need to value yourself first and foremost then others will see you the same. You do not suck! You are a wonderful human being filled with worth."
"Verizon, Concentrix, and Apple hire work from home call center agents.

There are a few sites where you can make $10-15 an hour teaching English if you get a $20 TESOL. Took me one night. Most places require a bachelor's degree, but a few don't. Just Google online ESL companies. If you decide to do it, remember to act like you did cocaine before the interview. Be very bubbly and full of energy. Like Steve from Blue's Clues. Or Google TPR ""total physical response"" to learn what they want from you.

Fiverr has editing, writing, design, etc. jobs--words, videos, pictures. Research assignments. Etc. Pay is low for most of the jobs, and there's competition."
"Sure, pm me. I'm speaking from my personal experience in Europe, Slovenia to be exact. Lots of companies here hire people from all over the world in tech. For remote work all over I suggest sites like weworkremotely, remotists and similar."
Like 17ish dollars per hour. It's definitely not bad pay compared to other entry level WFH jobs. But it also might vary by state. I'm in Washington state.
"I work fully remote and see no end to this work style for me.  I'm a consultant in the construction industry. Our clients don't require us to be in the office and my company has limited office space across the US.  They prefer people to work from home if our client doesn't want to give us office space.  I just requested to be assigned to clients that don't require us to be on site. 

I recommend looking for employment with companies that offer consultancy services to large clients. (I use LinkedIn)

Good luck with your search!!!"
i obtained 2 WFH jobs via indeed Feb 2022 and am still currently employed by both. Technical support/ Prod Support. both are just supplemental jobs that pay great and have  come in handy this year with inflation and investment opportunities. so i can say from my experience it wasn't awful. i am tempted to re-apply to keep my interview skills decent and test the waters for other opportunities. pay for these two is 106k and 89k. Downside they are contract positions and not FTE.
"I started using Indeed maybe 8 years ago. I've never had any success. I think in all that time it may have only led to one job interview and that interview was a scam. I too seek out remote work. All my jobs over the last decade have been remote. I've used sites like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and countless job boards dedicated to remote workers. The only success I've had is googling keywords related to my career interests and finding companies or job listings that way and applying for the jobs directly on the employer's website. Indeed is mostly filled with listings created by a foreign recruiters and scam artists. They don't properly vet the listings there."
"I'm extremely interested in Aira! I'd love to do that and work either super late hours or very early hours! I've been looking for a remote job forever because I'm moving very soon and I want to be able to work from home so I can do another job from home too (it's a hobby atm but I wanna do more with it).

I'll check out RatRaceRebellion too!"
"Good morning Kay! Do you mind sharing the name of your current job title because it sounds like something that I need to b searching for as well as I am n critical need of a job transition. I am trying to take advantage of the family medical leave time I started a few weeks ago to help care for my mom during her surgery recuperation.  I have over 20 years experience working with the Planning & Zoning Dept of a major city n the southeast, and I also just signed up for a real estate license class to provide myself with some additional value. Remote work in this industry would be a wonderful thing for me. Any advice that you could offer would be appreciated. Feel free to PM me also. Thanks!"
"I wish I could help but I don't know your expertise or of any specific companies that allow you to work remote from another country. Online work really varies depending on the person and the location All of my remote work requires me to live in the U.S. and I would not be able to do with those jobs in another country. One of them, for example, I have to report if I am traveling, and cannot work if I am out of my state. If you are looking for U.S. jobs you can work from Africa, I would try to research and find other people in Africa who are successfully working remote jobs and ask them which companies they are working for that allow them to work from a different country. That would be more helpful and lead to specific companies that would work for your situation."
Rural Northern Michigan for one if you can get that here. Median income in my area is 24k and housing is about 50% of that. So if you can get that income WFH and buy a house on an auction site (my bf bought his house on auction with a personal loan for 32k) then yes it's livable. Good luck.
I'm learning it's really hard to find remote work in CA
"Your con is horrible , what type of work do you do? 

That not my experience at all once my time hit I log off and I'm done for the day but my job is base off a queue system


Edit: my wife WFH once a week and she has a hard time disconnecting too but she work in fashion production and her job wasn't really structured for WFH.. 

it just something they slap on to retain talent  lol"
"Huh, I was working from home a couple of years. I had none of the cons you listed.

I had no problem disconnecting from work, as my home office was in a room upstairs that I never entered otherwise. Once I logged off, never gave a thought to the job.

No problem with isolation either since most of my coworkers were morons, and I was talking daily via Zoom to the ones I liked, lol

I also found that I was WAY more productive working from home. There were days when I had done all my work for the day in the morning and could chill for the rest. Whereas in the office, I would lose a ton of time with useless talks and meetings.

Overall for me, working from home was a HUGE upgrade."
I can agree on all of your points. Remote work is not for everyone.
"Having my own home office literally helped me this time around as it helped me by disconnecting my work space from my life space. I have sliding doors that close it off when I'm working, and if I want to use the space for recreation or anything else, opening the sliding doors has helped my brain separate it from being work time. I dunno why, but this simple change made a big difference for me compared to my first remote job.

It also helps that I've actively looked for friends to socialize with outside of work too."
"Did you really use ChatGPT to write the cons section?

Do you even work from home?"
Close but with remote work you absolutely have to set boundaries.
"Hourly WFH was a horrible experience for me. I had to be available basically all the time. 

Pros: work at your own speed with no neck breathing or office drama. Self guided schedule and work flow.

Cons: Distractability. With no discreet difference between my working and playing space (gamer here) it made it super hard. I had to wait for assignments to come through the pipeline, so because work was becoming more and more scarce because of COVID, I'd have my work email on one screen all day, and games on the other because I was expected to be available all the time even if I couldn't bill for it.."
there aren't any real cons to remote working
"There are myriads of available wfh jobs out there. First thibg you have to do is identify your skills or cross-skills and find the right plaform that offers those kinds of jobs. There are platform for programmers, VAs,, writers, etc."
"Like others said it very much depends on what kind of job you are putting work into.

I'm a university student and am doing remote work as I am employed by my university. I have only needed 4 things:
1. reliable + high (enough) speed internet - I have 2 roommates also attending class/working at the same time and we haven't had internet lag issues so far
2. Trusty laptop that can run the needed websites and applications (for me that's Zoom, Google Apps, Canvas for classwork, and Canva at the same time)
3. working camera + mic (courtesy of trusty laptop) for meetings, and
4. a quiet-enough place to work (preferably a blank wall), I work/attend class in my living room on my comfy couch.

I feel like those 4 things are the basics that can get you started and you can buy your additional gadgets (ex. Better quality webcam bc laptop isn't 4k) if needed/wanted"
"So, it's a weird situation, but the level of info you were provided is a pretty reasonable one. If it's set up right, thats a perfectly reasonable setup for secure work, they wouldnt care what device you connect with.

As far as it being normal - depends on the company. Plenty do expect you to provide your own computer in IT. Not a majority, and they usually have a solid secure remote work setup.

Hospitals arent usually that, so it just sounds weird. Honestly sounds like some sort of mixup on if your position was w2 or 1099"
Lots of remote work in digital Marketing& tons of free certs through google
I found lots of remote work on indeed(us) but many us companies outsource seo overseas to cut costs
"There are several academic writing websites that offer remote work for writers like writers labs, writer web, uvocorp, writer bay, academia research and livingston research. Hope this helps some people who have no job or want remote jobs."
Indeed and LinkedIn show a lot of Work From Home/Remote work from Travel Agents/Reservation Agents in FLORIDA. Mariott was advertising
Rat Race Rebellion has an entire website dedicated to work from home jobs in the US. Some as employee and others as contractors. Just know you generally have costs associated with contract work. I chose the contractor route but many people don't because of the upfront costs.
They give you vpns just to stop things like you leaving to travel from happening. The vpn is designed to work only at the location given at the time of employment. If you move like someone said you will be fired. Been working remotely for 3 years and know a lot. No way around it. And working in different states like they said is not going to fly.
"the company Dynata is often hiring remote call center agents with flexible hours. Check to see if theres one in your area. Aside from that, Lionbridge or Appen are good companies for easy remote work, depending on how much you want to earn. Some jobs can be done in an hour a day and pay $10 a day, and others can be done for longer periods of time and pay more than $14 so it depends. But look into it and good luck "
"Being a registered nurse, a lot of health insurance companies employ work at home positions for a variety of things. I know someone who handles a caseload of elderly patients that she checks in on on a weekly basis via phone (working from home/home office setup etc....)."
"Have you tried Xing and LinkedIn?  You can create a profile and fill it in with your skills and expectations. Recruiters will get notifications or maybe search for something you put in your resume. Working remotely is not that uncommon, and you may find something that fits you well."
"I'm in the same situation as you. I'm 20 and came here to study for two semesters. Very little jobs available for English speakers. The ones that are available for remote work and English speaking operations (IT, Marketing) require specialized skills and years of experience. There were CS jobs available at the US base in Wiesbaden the last time I checked. Try looking into that. I doubt you'll find a remote job living in a small town/village with the experience you have. Also, most people in small towns don't feel comfortable speaking English (they'll understand you but they won't be able to converse properly). So with the six months, try learning as much German as you can. You'll get by without it but won't be able to integrate properly."
"Nice effort, upvoted!

Made a [similar resource](https://getremotejob.xyz/) last year for people who don't quite know the remote work possibilities."
"I apologize because I really don't. 

I would look into the ""Paid To"" or ""User Testing"" header specifically, but I really cant guarantee that would work. If not there's r/beermoney and an international sub that I am personally not apart of.

I'm sorry I couldnt be more help, but I also wish you the best on getting a job you can work from home"
"Done! Partner works from home all the time; I started working remotely bc of COVID. It's been a learning curve, since we have to share bandwidth. We've learned the hard way that we can't video conference or listen to Spotify at the same time. Also in the process of converting my guest room into an office for me."
Is this open to people who live alone who are working remotely?

"I don't work for QVC but I am working customer service for another e-commerce company. My time is split between phone support and online support for incoming emails and chat support.

Do I like it? I like aspects of my job. This job has made me detest talking on the phone in my personal life. It's a tough job to be in right now because it seems like customers have overall become increasingly more impatient and rude since the pandemic began. The job takes a lot out of you and it is often quite thankless. You're going to get a lot of people that don't understand that logistics with order transit and order deliveries, and that even stocking products right now is significantly more problematic than before. People expect every company to operate with the same efficiency and speed as Amazon, with the same bandwidth. So, that can be frustrating dealing with customers who have such high expectations. Customer service/call centers seem to overall be feeling a lot of burnout right now. But honestly, the same can be said for everyone with the current climate. 

I do love my team and they're probably one of the only reasons I've stayed on this long. We keep each other sane and I'm privileged to be in their company. 

Working from home has been a huge plus for me though. Not being crammed next to people like we used to be working on location has been nice. I work in the comfort of my own home. I get to sleep in later. No commute. I save money since I'm eating my own food rather than cafeteria food or food trucks, delivery, etc. I get more time out of my day than I did previously. My cat gets to cuddle with me while I work (although she can definitely misbehave sometimes when I'm in the middle of a call with a customer lol). It's just overall a much more comfortable, natural work experience with all these WFH benefits. Idt I ever want to work on location again after WFH for almost 2 years. 

r/talesfromcallcenters will shed a lot more light on what it's like working for a call center than just my own experience, so definitely check that sub out. 

Congrats on the new job! Welcome to a more balanced WFH life!"
"If minimum wage is low in those states, potential WFH employees for Hilton at least can work for min wage from the comfort of their homes instead of slaving away for $6.49 at their local K-Mart. That's something IMO. "
"Well, I don't work for them but I assume it's download speed.  Seems like that's the minimum requirement for most work from home online based positions (including the last two I've had) so I would assume Hilton's is the same."
"> ""Appen acts very similar to YouTube, where they just randomly decide to shut down people's accounts for no good apparent reason.""

Some important side notes:

* You are not Appen's paying customer, their paying customers are the companies that advertise remote work on Appen.

* Appen presumably have many, many, many more potential remote workers than remote work vacancies from paying customers.

* Both points probably apply to any other site you might find. It is a buyer's market worldwide, and you are just one of very many prospective sellers."
"Just so I am not all negative Nancy alone in this thread. Here are some of the positives:

* Our group was the first experimental work from home department. (We were in a different building than the company headquarters, made sense to try it somewhere they could save a ton of money by getting rid of floor space.

Keep in mind the company I work for is a giant, slow moving behemoth. This was pretty revolutionary for them at the time.

* We had a 34% increase in raw productivity and a 19% increase in client satisfaction as well. In addition, a 26% increase in employee happiness. (Tons of more positive markers but that's a big one)

I was part of a team that asked a bunch of questions to try and figure out exactly why it was happening and here were the reasons we came up with.

* The most obvious. The employee was at home. They were happier in general because of zero commute and being able to cook/eat at home. With our health conscious people that was a big one.

* Another one was counter intuitive but makes a ton of sense when you break it down. Most assume home employees will slack more often, but it is actually the opposite. When you are only able to be judged by raw output it makes employees work harder. Without the ""show up points"" of letting a boss see you actually working it turns out you.... actually have to work.

Essentially we found ZERO negatives, and we are a collaborative work group. There are plenty of options online to telework with each other.

Another thing....  allowing your employees to work from home is the **only way** to give your employees a raise and SAVE money while doing it.

The company no longer pays for the office space and relating billing. The employee no longer commutes, essentially working less hours. The saved money on gas, metro tickets, etc... They can eat at home. 

This shit seems like a no brainer.... 

And finally my question (sorry for the long post). What do you believe is preventing companies from having more work at home positions? Like I said above, it is an obvious win-win for both parties. Why is this not happening more often?

Why isn't the government providing incentives as well? Pollution and, more tangible, traffic can both be fixed by more work at home opportunities.

I feel like I am taking crazy pills when companies don't even consider it an option for positions that have no real need for office space."
What are some industries or positions that you think will see a big shift to remote work in the next five or ten years that are currently in-person or on-site?
Do you feel that remote working could potentially lower a person's interpersonal and socialization skills? 
"Does SkipTheDrive do any type of polling of larger companies about their thoughts on why or why they cant implement remote work schedules? My wife works for a mental health non-profit that is allowing employees to work 2-3 days a week from home. In our case it doesn't change much because we live 5 minutes from her work, and I've still gotta be in the office every day. What's cool though, is that if both of us could work that type of schedule, we could move someplace further from the office, where housing is cheaper, weather is different, that type of thing. So even ""partial"" work from home setups have their benefits."
"Online college degrees have been gaining a lot of traction, but many hiring managers still don't value them the same as a degree from an otherwise equivalent brick and mortar college/university. Do you think companies that provide ample telecommuting opportunities are more likely to also give online degrees equal weight (compare to B&M degrees) in the hiring process?"
"I've been tempted over the past 4 weeks to really start to pursue a work from home type of career. For someone in my position, trying to gather ideas and concepts to make it practical for this married father of two, what would your best advice be?"
"I am a UK national living in Asia with my wife. I have what could best be described as agoraphobia so I seldom leave the house. I have experience in customer service and also ran a successful company for a few years before I walked away to spend time with my father who was ill. 

I guess my question is this - are there any work from home jobs that accept workers from overseas? I have done a few bits of microtasking here or there, but it's painfully slow to accrue money, and I'd just like a bit more of a stable income. "
"Wow, thanks for contributing your detailed findings to my AMA. These are certainly impressive statistics!

You're not taking crazy pills lol. I'm in complete agreement with you based on the aforementioned studies, as well as the surveys I've taken and people I've collaborated with. I firmly believe that when people are micro-managed, they aren't able to perform their best and are less productive.

And as for the environment, that's a NO brainer! There are a LOT of studies out there showing the impacts of the daily commute. You'd think that based on this 'health conscious' generation we live in, people would be more open to this paradigm. And don't you think governments should give 'green companies' more incentives?

And yes, allowing your employees to work-from-home is an indirect raise, when you consider the amount of time & gas money that is spent commuting. Not to mention possible parking fees and toll costs (See SkipTheDrive's telecommuting calculator](http://www.skipthedrive.com/how-much-money-can-you-save-by-telecommuting/)). I tell people that once seen as a 'perk' for employees, it's now mutually beneficial for employee and employer :)

With regards to your question about what's preventing companies from having more work-from-home positions - I think the problem comes down to trust. Like you mentioned, productivity has been shown to improve when working from home. Let's face it, many of us are introverts. In addition, the workplace can be very distracting at times. Funny, but in another subreddit, somebody was asking advice on how to get their co-worker to stop singing all of the time because it's driving him crazy lol!"
"Now this, is an important issue.

I do think that those who work from home still need social interaction, whether it be with family, friends, or joining a recreational group. I belong to a martial arts school and get my fix of socializing there a few days/week. I know from my own experiences that if I don't chat with the people I train with or socialize to some extent, I feel like I'm missing out on something. That said, it's still nice to pick and choose who you get tot socialize with ;-)

Here's an article on [how to keep a social life when working from home](http://www.skipthedrive.com/keeping-a-social-life-when-you-work-from-home/).

I'd be interested to see if there are studies on this. Thanks for bringing this up."
"I have not surveyed any companies regarding this, but this could be an interesting survey to conduct. Have either of you tried asking your companies if they'd be willing to allow for remote work (even if it was partial)? In my former company, my boss was open to doing that, as he understood how important flexibility was. "
"lol, well, if you have previous remote work experience, this is a huge plus! Also, if you state on your cover letter (not necessarily resume) that you have all of the necessary equipment for the job (and therefore aren't expecting them to purchase equipment), this could help. This is, of course, assuming you're willing to do this :)"
"This is a very common question I get. Here is my response that is in my FAQ page:

*We do not usually correspond with the hiring managers for the jobs listed on SkipTheDrive, so it is advised that you contact them directly to inquire. Because of the nature of telecommuting, it is entirely possible that geographical location might not be an issue for the hiring company. Each company has different requirements for each position. While some companies might be open to allowing non-U.S. residents to apply, some companies might require candidates to be located within the U.S. Our recommendation is to contact the hiring manager directly and see what their policy is.*
"
"Good questions! You're correct, the jobs I have are currently filtered from Indeed's publisher program. I've used other providers in the past, but am pleased with the quality of Indeed's jobs. In addition to filtering/displaying jobs, I do offer job postings for employers. I also created a calculator that can calculate telecommuting cost-savings (not necessarily a 'service', but a tool that is pretty nifty). 

Because the jobs are pulled from Indeed (in realtime), I can not guarantee the validity for each job offer.

You can certainly run searches directly on Indeed and filter yourself as well. I simplify the process by putting the filters in place so that you don't need to search for the common work-from-home/remote/telecommuting phrases. Another thing SkipTheDrive does is searches the titles ONLY, that way the job results are more accurate. For example, if you go to Indeed and type in **telecommuting**, by default it searches the title AND description of all jobs in their database. You might get some (false positive) results returned that contain the phrase ""no telecommuting allowed"" within the description. You can certainly filter this with indeed as well (by searching the title-only), but I have it done by default. I hope this answers your questions!"
"So you wouldn't suggest that it's probably a better idea for a recent college grad to not work from home.  Probably would learn a lot more by being in a workplace.  But not only that, any advancement they'd want might be allowed down.  No?"
"At my company, yes I've asked. I work for a utility company, and they are notoriously old school when it comes to vacation (another survey I'd like to see done) and out-of-office work, despite the fact that 75% of our employees spend most of their days out in the field, disconnected. I think if you asked our company leaders about remote work they'd say much of the staff already does it. In reality, especially with jobs like mine; they want me to be in the office to assist, troubleshoot, and support other roles in the company. My wife's job is almost entirely remote work, she only goes into the office for training or supervision."
"Working in a workplace does have it's advantages. Telecommuting is not for everybody, and I think that developing your social skills is important. I assumed you were a current student that was unable to work full time and was just looking to a part-time job that you could do without leaving campus. 

I did go back and forth with somebody yesterday who said their company actually required for them to be onsite if they wanted to advance. I was surprised about that, but some people do believe that it is beneficial to be onsite for this reason. It really depends on your personality type."
"I recommend you browse r/learnprogramming as many people there are in the same boat.

I'm trying to learn web development myself. I would say if it's something that is feasible and affordable for you, getting a degree would be a huge asset. Learning programming for free or independently is possible, but there's a lot of mixed opinions out there on whether people who are self taught can be/are as skilled or employable, but it's certainly doable, just probably more difficult. Other certifications may hold a little weight but a degree is pretty universally recognized as ideal.

General consensus I've heard from people is that it doesn't really matter what language you start with because you will probably need to know more than one to get a job, so pick one, stick with it until you're skilled at it, and then you can pick up others later, but people generally recommend you start with one to become adept at before you do. Since you know some C#, I suggest you keep learning that for now. Avoid hopping from language to language because one person or another recommends X as the best language to get employed.

Whether you opt to get a degree or not, but ESPECIALLY if you are going to be self taught, you should start keeping a portfolio of things you have programmed that demonstrate your ability. I've heard people say that programming on collaborative projects is also important, to demonstrate that you 1) can work on others' code and 2) can write code that is well documented/marked and clear so that others can understand and work on YOUR code.

As for finding a remote job, definitely programming related positions are currently one of the better careers for finding remote work. As with anything it might take some time to find something that is both remote and pays well, but it can be done."
"Take a look on the jobs available for you  (some remote work is country-specific).

"Go to r/CSCareerAdvice 

Every industry has online work now. There are good paying WFH jobs in Finance, Marketing & Logistics.

Don't just go with CompSci because you think it's the only career that will give you a WFH make sure that is a career path you _want_ and are _ready_ to pursue.

Emphasis on ""ready"" just because you want it, doesn't necessarily mean you are ready.

>I thought you needed a degree or something to even become a software engineer.

Realistically you still do need a degree. SWE field is getting more competitive. And you'll be applying for the same jobs as people with degrees will be applying for. A lot of influencers sell you on the idea of breaking into CompSci without a degree, but it's much more harder than it seems.

> Also, is it hard to get a remote job as a programmer?

Many programming jobs are remote. But it's hard to get a programming job period.

> Is there any qualifications or certificates I should get (I have no idea how it works). Shall I get a degree anyways?

Learn how it works, do some more research and figure out if you want to be a software engineer. If you can't design a curriculum for yourself that is tailor-made for the career path you want (ex: Web Dev) then it sounds like you are better off getting a degree instead. Because if there's an area that you fail to study up on by yourself, those gaps in knowledge will hurt you in interviews when your peers learned it at their universities."
US remote worker. My company is international and we have a UK segment. Love it. Do I love my current job? My boss has low key become a dick so looking elsewhere. But I don't think I'd ever go back to in person working. I have a nice office set up. I can go see my dogs whenever. Although it can be isolating and you really have to push yourself to interact with people more. But 10/10 no pants all day is great

"For a online, remote, home office job Telus international it's a very good option, maybe the pay is a little low for the U.S ($6 DLLS PER HOUR), but you wouldnt need any qualifications -only that you can speak english -, and is very flexible. I was working with the instagram and facebook marketplace campaign and i make almost 1500 dlls the last month (working 8  to 9 hrs daily). In linkedin they publish daily offers for new positions :-) . Sometimes it takes them a while to respond to you request but you can try, have luck!"
"That strange that they hire a felon and give them access to customer personal information. 

No way other WFH would hire him"
"As someone who deals with anxiety around driving, the world of remote work opening up sounds really exciting. There are jobs I don't apply for because of where they are located, what a commute would be like. It would mean more options potentially. I have done some work from home when everything shut down for COVID and I loved it. It was hard going back to the office with outdated equipment when I could finish tasks 3x faster at home.
These days I am realizing that a five day work week isn't what I want out of life, and it's the hope that working from home may be one possible avenue. If the wage was feasible I'd do part time if health insurance and benefits weren't for full-time only. For now it's the hunt for 4x10 schedule but they're few and far between."
"I feel you on this. The idea of being car dependent doesn't appeal to me (though I like the freedom that cars can bring if you want).

Glad to hear you're loving the remote work side of things! The getting stuff done faster is just amazing. Way fewer distractions, it's amazing. I can't believe how much more productive I got once I stopped working in an office with a commute."
This exists... But is not easy to find. One of my friend did this: Instead of trying on job sites he participated in forums and discussions and related to programming and he will look for offers he also posts about his skills on forums and got some emails and response. within 3 weeks he got around 4 to 6 part time remote works. All of them were pay per work.
"They are rare and I'd advise against them to be honest. When working remotely, there needs to be an element of trust that you can achieve the task and don't need much oversight. Hiring a junior Dev has a cost to a company as you'll likely need to review their work and answer their questions. This is harder remotely and most remote companies run lean. 

No matter how good you think you are, you have never seen how large scale applications are developed or deployed, even simple things like
Scrum, JIRA etc at scale. These are equally as important as lines of code. 

For yourself, from a professional development standpoint, it will stand to you to work in a office even for a year or two. You can surround yourself with senior devs and see how every tier works first hand. You'll learn a lot more a lot quicker. 

If you work remotely with just a dev team, you are unlikely to see the other facets of the business that either may interest you or could just be good to know e.g. Client relations, management etc. 

In short, I'd recommend you never take a fully remote job as your first job."
"Indeed.com has endless WFH jobs. Just search ""remote"" and narrow it down to IT."
"Not typically, no  Their hiring pool is large, people who are willing to work for less and are flexible because it means they can work from home. So, they can ask for the world.  I see jobs a lot that really shouldn't require a college degree or even a master's but because there are so many over qualified people out there they can find those type of people.  Even Appen and Lionbridge usually want a college degree."
"I mean I found my current remote position through Indeed and saw a lot of SEO positions and specialists pop up, however it took me 7 months of consistent job searching to finally land my remote work. So you need to stick with it because it's not just regional competition it's the whole damn world."
"We can go back and forth all day. I don't have a degree but got my TEFL. I started out at $19/hour. Yes people who have better credentials get more $$$$$. Guess what?

That is true everywhere. 

The reality of working remotely is that there are a greater number of applicants for each job posting."
"I know this post is a couple months old, but I wasn't in a position yet to do work from home when it was first posted. I've checked the application link a couple times since and, today, found that it is back up. I applied! Thanks for the opportunity."
"So I work for a company that has almost every type of Engineer position, and I worked directly with (riverine and coastal) engineers pretty much every hour of the day and have an office next to them. It entirely depends on the office head of the location you get assigned to or your supervisor.   
  
I work at a global engineering and design firm and positions are posted as working in-office. In the interview, is where they will actually tell you whether you can be fully, partially, or not remote at all. Because at the end of the day, certain contracts and depending on your experience with the type of work, they need you to be in the office. That need I've experienced has ranged from: ""senior members/supervisors must be present in the office when their team members are"", ""we're not using enough budget for the year for overhead costs and need people in the office a few days a week to help increase this or we must refund a substantial amount of money back to the government for contract x"", or simply they want you in the office because they need to be able to monitor you until they feel like they can trust you to communicate effectively and work from home.  
  
I had an Project Manager/Engineer that stopped coming to the office and was absolutely atrocious at getting back to anyone including their own staff. The PM would set meetings and then either not call in or be 30 mins late. But if the team was late he'd practically hit the ceiling. As you may know, being in this field it's easy to hire someone but it's particularly difficult to fire someone. So just apply to some in-office only posted roles within a longer commute for a larger company. Bring it up if you get the later round interview, and then decide from there. A friend of mine applied to an in-office only position and in his job acceptance terms and contract he will transition to remote-only after 6 months. After 3 months he will transition to 1-2 days a week in-office and the rest at home. All the best!"

What I am working on doing is working with people who can provide services that would increase in demand if problems in the economies got worse. Through this I'm looking to create both WFH opportunities and WFH jobs. 

It's important to differentiate between 'Opportunity' and 'job'. A job you can be paid as much as it makes sense to pay you, and an opportunity you can be paid as much as you can make.  Performance based things are opportunities (for those who suit them) and customer service etc is jobs.

I am looking to set up various businesses to accommodate the requirements of destruction getting worse. Through these businesses I can give people jobs. For those who can help me launch and build these via sales/promo there are opportunities."
"Yes, bookkeeping can be tricky in prices but you also get what you pay for too. I have clients through work that use cheap bookkeepers and their accounts are a mess. The only good thing is the bank statements are reconciled. My wife does remote bookkeeping only part time. Pending how many bank/credit card accounts and if the business needs payroll, she charges a flat fee every month and that works. I'd like to help her grow it and offer tax services too but there are   still too many businesses in my opinion that don't trust remote work. They still prefer to have a bookkeeper come into the office to work on their accounting and it's not necessary anymore. "
"I don't have a problem trusting remote work, however for myself like I said, at that rate I might as well hire local.  If you're stuck on your rate just keep at it and eventually you'll get that clientele.  You may also have to lower your rate at first to gain online reviews then you can raise them on new clients.  I use upwork.com for hiring remote staff."
"Freelancing is tough, no matter what skills you have. You end up doing a lot of unpaid work, like marketing your services and consulting with potential buyers, and on sites like Freelancer and Fiverr you'll be competing with a lot of people willing to do the same things for a lot less. Even if you do a great job of selling your value to people willing to pay higher for better results, those kinds of people are the minority in places like that. If you're in the States, I would recommend networking through the MeetUp app.

If you're searching for jobs yourself, don't go in blind. The ratio of scams to legitimate remote job offers is staggering. [Rat Race Rebellion](https://ratracerebellion.com) is by far my favorite work from home job listing site. They vet all of their listings in advance so you don't have to sift through the fakes yourself. If you don't see anything that fits your skills in recent posts, then check out their Big List (there's a link at the top of the page). You can type ""education"" in the search bar and see what jobs fit you. They also have a course that only costs, like, $10 and teaches you how to search for legit work from home job listings yourself and how to craft resumes that work specifically for remote employers. I definitely recommend it if you can spare the change. It helped me immensely.

To answer your last question, education and experience are weighed differently from employer to employer. I will say that most employers who have educational requirements have an added ""or equivalent in experience"", so I would say that experience is better in general.

Sorry for the text wall, but I hope some of it is helpful. Good luck out there, OP!"
"I would check stackoverflow jobs, hackersnews jobs section and linkedin. Some companies want remote workers from a specific area."
"My little rural town of Choteau, Montana is putting together a plan to attract remote workers. It's nice to be validated that other, bigger communities are doing the same."
"Wow...this is awesome. Considering I'm working remotely right now, I think I might have to apply for this. Would be moving from Texas/Rhode Island. 

Thanks for sharing this."
"Is being a youtuber a ""remote worker"" ?"
"I think that some people/companies don't get the idea behind ""remote workers"". 

The point of working remotely is that you don't have to have people live in a specific location.  You can get employees from anywhere. 

Having to live in a specific location kind of negates the point of having a remote position. 

SRC: 10+ years working for companies remotely, none required me to move."
"They consider remote workers to either be self-employed, or full-time employed by a remote company. A YouTuber is self-employed."
"What? This is real? I'm getting so much stuff in the mail, and I've just been through so many scams. I'm really looking for legit companies 
As a side job. Still waiting to start my own business. I've been a Registered Nurse for 13 years and still going to school to be a Nurse Practitioner and it's not easy. Anyone pls let me know of any real WFH or similar opportunities. Good job on finding a legit one!"
I know Apple is hiring WFH reps right now. Amazon may be again soon but those go very quickly. Good luck to you!
"Okay, I was just curious. I am always looking for another place that offers WFH."
I have a B.S. in Computer Science and I've been building and repairing PCs for almost 20 years. We just moved (wife got a job good opportunity) to an area where there aren't any IT jobs. The idea of working remotely sounds great as I would like to stay in the IT field. This sounds like a great possibility going to submit my resume right away. Thank you.
" Thank you! I think she should be ok, her primary reason for entering the states is holiday, but there will be a small overlap of when her scheduled leave runs out, and she will have to do some remote work via her laptop (essentially a few days of answering client emails and Skype meetings), before she has to fly back to her home country."
"Oh I have a job, a WFH job actually, you don't have to worry about me applying. It had an actual tangible listing, and an application process beyond ""PM this three month old Reddit account to see if they 'like you.'"" 

Your defensiveness is remarkably suspicious as well, so kudos for outing yourself. You'd think the correct thing to do would be to recognize how vague and shitty your post is and provide the *very obviously missing information,* maybe clear up the blatant discrepancy between whether you're hiring or your friend is hiring. 

So, I'll repeat for anybody else reading this far down: this is suspicious as fuck and any job that is this vague yet this contradictory, posted by an account this new, should be regarded with heavy cynicism, and I strongly discourage giving this person *or anybody they claim as an associate* any kind of personal information."
"When you work from home, the work is not always regular. Often times, I sit and wait for the work to come, and I get sleepy while waiting, so I eat in order not to fall asleep. Then I put weight on. This is where I am. How do you approach this situation?"
"I want to apply but I have two questions for you:

1.) Can I use my best reddit posts as examples of my content writing? I get a lot of positive feedback for them and I am currently expanding them into articles for my personal site (not live yet). They will give you a good idea of who I am and if our values will align. 

2.) Does running a creative agency remotely with clients in different time zones count for experience as a project manager and as a remote worker? I wake up at 5am every day to take care of my daily to-do lists, so I am definitely a self-starter. I used to work in a support role at Bluehost.com , that's where I realized I could actually work for myself.

I am very passionate about design, how it's more than just how something looks/feels but how it works, how good design can do more with less, how great design improves quality of life.

Looking forward to hearing back! Thanks for posting here!"
"My job is strictly work from home, and a policy in our business is to video-chat everytime you call a colleague/have a meeting. We use Microsoft Teams internally but you can use whatever video conferencing software (Zoom, Gotomeeting, Google, etc.). It does make a difference!"
"""Remote work"" is an older phrase, and is inclusive of offshore workers and contractors.

""WFH"" is newer, and refers specifically to the COVID-induced breakdown of the old way of working; it generally is exclusive to full-time workers who would otherwise have been in a local office.

It's a meaningful distinction, for now at least.   Maybe someday after the situation has had some time to settle out the two terms will merge.

I agree that the term ""work from home"" is a little unfortunate; it somehow seems to suggest to some people that the ""work"" part is optional....  but I'm not aware of a better alternative in common use."
"It is called remote work. It's always been called remote work. It's the new, temporary because of COVID people who started calling it work from home."
The people who the most riled up about this are commercial realtors who are going broke from WFH. Thats the problem and the do nothing managers that cannot hide behind their bs.
"Like others have said, I basically have to work from my home office because I'm not dragging my monitors to the beach or whatever. But I totally agree it should be called remote work instead of work from home. That makes it sound way more professional."
"I'm a remote employee, I have been for almost 8 years now.  The people who work in the office but take a day to work from home are referred to as WFH."
"They would hate remote work even more due to the security risks involved with logging into other WiFi networks. 

Yes WFH is remote, but the basis is you have your own private network that you control. It wasn't long ago that public access points in cafes and hotels were exploited by bad actors running key loggers to steal people's login credentials"
"I do call it remote work. And I work from all over, not just home."
"They are two different things. My company has a work from home policy, not a remote work. They track IP addresses. This all started when we realized that there was a person working for month in a state that we did not have tax burdens established with. Became strict work from home after that, with case by case remote exceptions."
"I am chillin' at home on the couch in my Jammies,  LOL. But, I absolutely get my work done!  I don't sit here with a mouse jiggler, post TikToks, or go shopping. I'm extremely grateful to be able to work from my couch and show it through aggressive results. If people do not stop posting about being lazy while working remotely, we will all be forced back into the office. It's important for people like me who have health issues. If I was not able to work remotely, I'd probably be forced to go on disability."
"Yeah, I agree with you. It's especially frustrating to see people discount WFH like commuting and additional costs aren't relevant"
"I almost posted this same exact thought the other day. There are several Remote Work subreddits but they aren't as big as r/WFH . Work From Home sounds like we are lazy just lounging around in our jammies all day barely doing anything. It couldn't be further from the truth. You are right, it needs to be called Remote Work or Flexible Working"
"A lot of people are just chilling with WFH.

Or as my office says, working from home means not working."
"Hence why I am classified as ""Remote worker"" not WFH.

To change my classification, they would have to change my designation and band... which means I get to negotiate a raise.

Not that they will, our company has sold off/shut down all their offices with the exception of one in each state capital, and some in large cities.

Still around 300 sites, but many are only 20 to 50 people for a company with 300K employees."
"I have job posting claiming to be ""remote"" standing in for field work and in office time. So, WFH is much more accurate."
"For my work, it IS strictly WFH and calling it ""remote"" like that would not fit. I absolutely cannot use any other location or internet connection other than my own ip at my home address. And yes, I am literally working in the recliner in my pajamas. Everything you said is the exact opposite of my reality."
"But I actually ""work from home"". Aren't we calling it both?"
"Remote work sounds to me like you don't even have to be at home, you can just chill at the beach and walk with your dog."
"This is what I have started to call it. Maybe around close friends I make it clear that I work from home, but otherwise just say ""oh, we are all remote"" when referring to my coworkers, who are quite literally, spread out across many states."
"Remote can mean working somewhere that isn't your home or an office. My husband is 100% remote but only works from home sometimes. Other times he's on a job site. Consultants have historically been ""100% remote"" meaning traveling Monday through Thursday and WFH on Friday. 

There are also potential implications (to you and your company) from working somewhere outside of your home, depending on how far you go. Some companies or organizations require their employees to work in their house for security reasons. In the US, working in a different state (or city) can have tax implications. And if you are working in a country where you are not authorized, that can cause massive problems."
"In the IT field, Remote Work means you're doing a good job implementing systems that bring the work to the administrator, rather than the administrator to the customer. In this way, it draws focus on the churn-and-burn requirement of maximizing human resource utilization."
This whole WFH and RTO thing has been very annoying and I'm sick of management gaslighting RTO and trying to shame people for not physically coming to the office and sitting in the front row at all the stupid all hands meetings. Fuck off with that bullshit already.
"Definitely. I always say work remotely (but I guess when I type I may say ""WFH""). I think that you're right that calling it ""from home"" has a negative connotation."
"I mean that's what happens with a lot of progressive ideas. Conservative morons coin a phrase and progressives are too naive to push back on it with proper phrasing. Student Debt Forgiveness, Defund the Police, WFH, quiet-quitting, etc etc."
Fuedalism of keeping people tied to the land is unfortunately still a reality even in remote work.
"Remote work includes Work From Home, but is a much wider concept. 

Not everyone working from home is working remote.  (caregivers, farmers, artists etc.) 

So both groups are overlapping but are not the same. 

WFH has a lot negative stigma attached since it was hyped during the pandemic- I prefer using the term ""working remotely"" when I talk to people about it."
"""Work from home"" confines you to the limits of your home by definition, remote work removes all physical barriers."
I work from my home office. Or the dining room table at my vacation home. Or the hotel room when taking a trip. Or the bar on a Friday afternoon.
"Great framing - I agree. The more we use language that disconnects work from any location, the better. Remote work it is even if you ""have"" to do it from home!"
"Spent 21 years in a global consulting firm, and another two in a global software development company. I'd be on calls were half or more of the folks weren't on the same continent as I was, much less the same city. For the latter half of that time, pre-COVID, we generally didn't bother with conference rooms. The technology in conference rooms generally meant that, if there was more than one person dialed in, it was generally better for *everyone* involved if we all just dialed in separately. Working from home was a natural drift. 

My point? Maybe instead of ""othering"" someone by calling it ""remote work""/""remote worker,"" work overall could be **distributed work**. Some folks may be in an office, some from their home, still others from a data center or coffee shop. This would align everyone as simply contributing, not somehow slacking by ""WFH."""
It's more likely called WFH for reasons of income tax and labor laws.
I almost always refer to it that way though my company and many others continue to use the WFH term.
People called it *work from home* 25 years ago when I started in tech. It's definitely not a new term.
"For many companies it really is work from home. My company is almost entirely work from home employees and my employment contract says that my place of employment is my home and specifically mentions lists my region and country.

That said, in practice they don't actually care where I work from so long as it's in the same country. My understanding is it all comes down to tax liability."
I like the term 'Telecommuting'
"Plenty of answers from the federal government folk, but I have seen the same in the private sector too. My wife worked a travel sales job for years, and her employment agreement was WFH with H defined as her registered residential address. It was eight years before she was cleared to work from anywhere in the US.

I work in financial services and have ""theoretical"" access to account data, and I am restricted from bringing my laptop outside the country.

I've worked from home off and on for years. Even when I started my career as a field sales guy in the early 2000s, I was told to set up a ""home office."" And I was held accountable for where I was and what I did. I didn't start referring to ""remote work"" until my family would want me on weeklong vacations I didn't have PTO for so I would sit and work in my hotel bedroom while everyone else went to the theme parks. 

In my experience, remote work implies even more flexibility than WFH. The terms aren't synonymous."
I've wfh/remote for years now I do get up and do my morning routine hair teeth get dressed and I do have a home office. I have worked at my moms and a friends both in different states but have a room dedicated to me while I'm there. I'm never at the beach coffee shop or in my Jammie's
"Problem is too many people don't and there's plenty of evidence for it. 

There's an entire sub where people take advantage of the ""extra time"" and work multiple full time jobs at the same time remotely. They openly admit it and discuss it.

With that happening, it's hard to say it's not happening more than we can see, it's pretty safe to say at least some people are abusing it, some quite aggregiously. 

There's also literally a market for mouse jigglers and other devices and stategies that are obviously deceptive tactics to fool people into thinking you're working when you're not.

So as long as that's all happening, you can expect people to have a negative attitude towards it. 

You're obviously biased, maybe you do work from home all day and actually stay at your desk (I do as well) but I can't deny that many people are ruining it for people like us and we can't just ignore that."
"Where I work 

 ""working remotely"" means either out on site or in a place where the same capabilities as the office can't be expected due to poor connection or lack of equipment.

WFH means someone is working from home but the same level of responsiveness and productivity can be expected."
"I was using WFH even before COVID as well as several people at my job. It was a common thing to do when you had to wait for a package or whatever that required you to stay at home for the day. People would just send out a message saying WFH for whatever reason. 

Meanwhile Remote work meant like you said, workers that had no access to an office and would always work remotely. 

I'm not sure which is the correct term now though, and at work we've now moved to a full-freedom hybrid where everyone can choose how many days they're in the office (can be 0) with the only caveat being that if you're in less than 50% you don't get a permanent desk."
"Those seem like either easily surmountable hurdles.  you need a primary address to work any job unfortunately.  but even under your most strict restrictions ""work from wherever your company is legally allowed to conduct business"" is dramaticly less reductionist than ""work from home"""
"I think you're mixing legal needs with what are essentially propaganda terms. WFH and RTO are just labels for two locations. Legally and semantically, both need to be well defined by HR, which is fine. That really doesn't have anything to do with working in a company owned and operated facility and working outside a company owned and operated facility. We could just as easily claim that ""Return to Office"" means I work out of my home office, since that's as good an office as any other office."
"Maybe in the media / casual conversations? I'm applying for jobs right now, I don't think I've seen a single JD use the phrase WFH. They all say remote already."
"> A lot of people are just chilling with WFH. Or as my office says, working from home means not working.

They are people that socialize all day in the office or browse the internet, do you chastise them?"
"I WFH and actually I'm more productive at home then I am in the office. Since starting to WFH, my bonuses have increased 25%."
"Your last sentence is literally my point. calling it ""wfh"" is to intentionally make you think it's less flexible than it is.  Quite nearly every single comment on this post that insists they are required to work from home are really actually limited to anywhere on the planet that the company can conduct business.  ""work from anywhere in the state"" or ""work from anywhere in the country"" would more accurately describe the reality of the majority of the situations in this post."
"Same, due to security, it is not REMOTE work, it is work from a specific, defined location = home."
"While what you said Is accurate, it is also irrelevant.  If the company is satisfied with the output they see from an employee, they continue having them on the payroll - if they don't like the output, they remove them from the payroll. 

Like you, I work a full day for a single employer from an office I've dedicated space for in the basement of my house.  And that someone, somewhere is working 3 jobs during the same hours would start to irritate me, if I thought about it very long -- but as long as their output satisfied their employer's expectations, they are meeting the expectations of the job.  So it's not any of my business.

I've worked enough different places to know that there are plenty in an office setting that are rarely at their desk, so this isn't a ~~WFH~~ remote concern."
"Those are all problems rooted in the employer though, not in the work ethic of remote work employees.  Mouse jigglers are only necessary to keep middle managers employed because if the work is otherwise getting done and no other work is being assigned, then the managers have nothing to ""check on"" and really no purpose at all.  If the work required is getting done, it literally shouldn't matter what else people do with their time in the day. what you're trying to brand as ""abuse"" is actually extremely reasonable behavior if no work is being assigned and all work is otherwise completed. the ""extra time"" is the employers job to fill. it shouldn't be the employees job to pretend that time is always full."
"I don't see why you think that wearing pyjamas is such a problem. My ability to work does not depend on what I'm wearing. And for the other stuff: Glad to work in a job and in a company where we can do all that stuff openly, because we are treated like adults and trusted that we will put in the time later if we interrupt work earlier for private things. Nobody is hiding when they stop work for private matters, we openly communicate that and our CEO knows and just does not care. And this is how it should be. In the end it only should count that the work is done.

Stop blaming the workers for the misconceptions and prejudices of others. You seem to belive that you are doing a good cause for WFH. You are not."
"Interesting! I never heard the term WFH before covid, but it's interesting to learn that the term predates the global phenomenon.

Sounds like your organization is taking a good approach to the situation, meanwhile.  It's fascinating watching how different orgs are wrestling with the idea in such different ways, and I'm really curious to see how it plays out in the long run.  

(My expectation is that there'll be a permanent bifurcation between the companies that fully embrace WFH and go 100% online, those that will force a return to physical proximity no matter what, and those like yours that take the middle ground and leave the choice up to their employees.   What I can't predict is which of those will be most successful, or if they'll all coexist and just develop different cultures around how work happens.  All three strategies come with advantages and disadvantages, and of course there are lots of jobs that *can't* be done remotely, so -- while I obviously know my own personal preferences -- there isn't a clear winner-takes-all ahead.)"
"Not directly in HIPAA, but that's more because the law was signed almost 30 years ago, before WFH was a thing. The HITECH Act, which was passed in 2009, does cover this."
"The popularity of remote work has really exposed how slow regulations can catch up to reality. All states are different and while some you need to work 6 months and a day to qualify, other states require income taxes paid if you work even one day from there. Technically, if you're traveling for work and answer a work email in the airport--you would owe taxes in that state.

Reality is basically no one does that except for professional sports players or people who live in border towns and commute across state lines every day.

And its not just the US that doesn't have their shit together, tourist visas haven't caught up either since having Outlook on your phone and answering an email may or may not violate the tourist visa."
"Oh do I hear you. I was hybrid and experienced exactly what you said. 

Just a clarification. What people wear and do during breaks during WFH days is up to them. But a little discretion is good to keep unwarranted negativity from on site workers at a manageable level."
"What I find most interesting is that it seems the willingness to be in office is in part tied to the overall culture of the workplace, which is directly reflected on the remote work policies. What I mean is that a company like where I work has a relaxed and even nice work culture even in office, which is reflected by the freedom of choice we get, this leads to people willingly coming to office despite not being forced to. Then you get others with bad or toxic office culture, with micromanagers and here you see this reflected in forced RTO, which people don't want to do because the environment was already bad. 

It's interesting to see, for me at least. 

Then for me personally I get along with some people in the office and enjoy the interaction, I also like my office setup. I prefer to be in office when I don't have too many meeting and can focus on getting stuff done without the distractions at home, and stay home on days with more meetings, where I won't be realistically productive I'm the 30 mins between meetings, but can relax or do some house chores in that time."
"Government work is a whole different ballgame. Usually it's security related. I wouldn't even lump that in, but technically, all work from home is remote, but not the other way around."
Not broadcasting isn't hiding. How many years have you been working remotely and for what type of company? My company did not like people not being in the offices but I did because of my reputation. That's all.
"I completely agree. 

Then you had an ideal situation. Not everyone does. In my former company remote working was not the norm and those of us who did had to ""set an example."" Many in office people spent half the day on the internet and networking. Then they stayed in the office until 7 PM so they appeared ""dedicated."" Very unfair but that's life. 

Incidentally I retired shortly before Covid and the world sure has changed. 

Good luck to you all."
"Absolutely true. Incidentally, one of my adult children and his spouse went entrepreneur after working for others. The effort was immense, expensive and risky. They are doing ok. 

I bristle when people say they are ""lucky"" because it wasn't primarily luck, it was a career plan. Working remotely is too. It doesn't just happen. Even if people think it should."
"It sounds like, from one of your responses, the burnout wasn't associated to WFH, but from that particular role at that particular company. It only makes sense to look for another job, this time remote as you aren't happy with the new job you got."
"I know that burnout and depression can impact decision making, so I'm not judging at all. You did what you thought was right for you.

That said, I have a couple of notes in hindsight that might help someone else who is going through this:

- The fact that buying a car (!!) and working in an office environment would lead to an extra financial burden should not come as a surprise.

- Depending on your old salary, taking a long mental health break via FMLA (US) probably would not have cost more than the $10k + expenses. This might have been a good option if you had some savings to keep you, or access to state Paid Family Leave or short-term disability. A break like that may have given you the time and mental clarity to find a job with a better fit - either a lower-stress WFH job or an in-person/hybrid job with better pay.

Again, no judgement. None of us deserve that sort of job stress. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope you find something better quickly!"
"I left a wfh job a few years ago due to burnout and a stressful position, within months I regretted it due to the salary decrease and stress from a micromanagement at the new job. I went back to the same employer but a different position that is hybrid. I'm happy but I made a few changes in my life. I joined a gym to force me out of the house and I actually use my PTO. I had let my wfh job become my life and was too available to work after hours and on days off. I learned what a lot of people did that you still have to have a life."
I've never heard of anyone taking a pay cut to RTO. I'd take a pay cut and a demotion to WFH full time again. Only working in the office because of new policy.
you went from wfh to office job AND took a paycut?  i did something similar but did so on a 35% increase.  still kind of meh so your switch must be awful.
"oof took a paycut to rto, that's rough.  go back to a WFH gig man, this rat race is a scam."
"Think and talk about this with friends more and more. We're all older and at senior positions with our firms. I see both sides, advantages and disadvantages. Without going in to all the details, my observation is it's generally split into two camps; those focused on their jobs (assuming YOU can function 100% remotely as well as in office), and those focused on CAREERS. No wrong or write answers here, but the consensus I see / hear/ and believe it those most interested in upward mobility, recognition, advancement, promotion and growing internal political capital, in office is pretty key. Simply put, we want to see you, know you, engage with you on a personal level (be able to look in the whites of your eyes so to speak). If that's not important to you, it's not important to us.

If you're comfortable in your career and not looking for much lift, remote is fine. You can be a big contributor, do a great job, be effective, etc. We need people like that and we want them to be happy. But the future leaders of product lines, divisions, et al need to be more present. Primarily because it's not just about you/your role, but rather how you integrate into other disciplines, leadership, etc.

It's taken me a long time to make this distinction. Not everyone strives for the next goal or role. Lots just want their check and to live their life. That's fine.

The real problem is when the former wants the latter but still want it on their terms (WFH). That doesn't work and you'll see that playing out across industries in promotions, raises, mobility, career trajectory, etc. That's why I think it's a big mistake for young people and those young in their career / position with their company to WFH. Unless you're certain you don't want to maximize growth opportunities, get in the office and play the game."
"I do not understand this sentence, "" I left my remote job earlier this year because I was pretty burnt out. ""

Define ""burnt out"" first. IF your personality is not meant for WFH and self-motivated. Returning to WFH will not work for you either and you just have to accept RTO and ""office culture"" and find new RTO jobs that pays more... that is literally the OLD school of office hustle."
"I got nothing for you on this.  

You know you made the wrong decision and everyone is going to tell you the same thing.  

The stress from the added expense and paycut are probably stressing you out more than the original job. 

time to start looking for a new WFH gig.  Lesson learned."
"different strokes, right?  I make $125k a year and WFH about 3 days a week(bosses are not strict with it, more focused on work being done, not where it's being done). That said, I would *gladly* pay $10k to officially stay home the other 2 days a week....."
"Happy Hour is not a requirement.
WFH, doesn't get easier or more therapeutic  for Mental health.
  Are you sure there isn't more to the story?"
"WFH is always better.


You def made a series of bad decisions taking a paycut and losing WFH"
"I don't believe this is a REAL post. The title gives it away ""remote work actually saved me more money"" ... I can't think of any scenarios where remote work does not save more money. UNLESS much higher pay is associated with working in the office. You chose a job that pays you $10k less and requires you to purchase a vehicle? What were your expectations? did you understand you'd be making less money, spending more and HOPING you'd be ""happier"" in your new role."
Most people would take a pay cut to wfh and demand more to be in office.
"Advice?  Job hunt for WFH...

I saved $400 a month and 40 hrs a month in gas/travel alone"
"That's the nature of the industry and not the nature of remote work. Your job is what burned you out, not where you were doing it from."
"I was thinking the same.
Your burned out from WFH?
Just wait to you move back into the office 5 days a week."
"Well, i can tell you did the right thing. If they couldnt respect you by putting you in the hospital your only way out was quitting. 

Its just tougher to find WFH right now. Its both competitive, companies will take advantage of you or they will finagle you into hybrid."
"Same as you, $10k. Good luck in finding WFH.. somehow I think the best balance for you, and in general, is a hybrid situation. I wanted to stay home to be close to my wife and kids as my commute was just so long, it was taking my time away from them. But admittedly, working from home can be a real challenge in and of itself. I took the pay cut out of necessity, but it didn't really lower any stress for me lol"
"I used to have a regular wardrobe refresh because of that. Not so much because I'm stylish, but because sometimes my size changes and sometimes I wear things out. I do laundry mid day too...my WFH space is right next to the laundry room...it's an easy habit to grab a handful of whatever when I go upstairs and drop it in the machine on the way by."
"Yes that is correct, my job burned me out and not remote work - I think that because I was so burned out, I was not thinking clearly and was desperate to just get any job and my prospects were much greater if I looked at in-office jobs too instead of just remote jobs"
Thanks for sharing your situation - I could probably swing hybrid if I worked 2 days in-office and 3 days WFH. Time to find a new job that offers that!
"My opinion? I'd take the new job. While I love WFH, that $60k in overall compensation is a big chunk of change. Especially since the commute is only ~25min. You said you were bored."
"You're just having cold feet, like you said. You can always find another WFH job in the future if it doesn't work out. Don't miss out on a great opportunity because you're afraid of what you're giving up. Think about what you'll gain."
"How comfortable do you feel negotiating the hybridity of it? If you feel good I'd bring up that as part of the negotiations. Let them know that you value the office but that you have been very productive wfh as well for the past few years and if possible would love the opportunity to discuss if its an option early on, past the first 30 days or first 90 days, or something similar.

Some companies are down to discuss it, especially if you do the first 90 days and can demonstrate you know your shit."
Everyone who said WFH didn't read past the title.
"WFH 100%. You won't regret it. The lifestyle is SO much better than an extra 10k.  I have been working from home for 7 years now, and I will never go back to the office again other than maybe a trip down 2-3x a year."
Is there any specific vest period or rules for the 401K contributions? A big WFH fan. but that 25% sounds too juicy to pass up and retire early or work a simple job after this.
If you keep the wfh job DM me the satellite job. I'd take a pay cut for those benefits for sure.
"This new job is a no brainer. It's far and above more than what you have.  I'd love a WFH job or something hybrid, but it would take a heckuva specific life situation to make me pass by the new job.  Just the part about you being bored and more with the current job would be enough. 

Take the opportunity in front of you and run with it."
You are asking a work from home sub if you should take a work from home job?
$115k WFH all day long.
Wfh didn't even read beyond the title
"WFH.  Consider drive time, wear and tear on a car.  If the commute is 30 min or more, i think the decision is easy.  

Also consider if something comes up at home, sick child, contractor at your home, you're there, and can cover those things that come up.

Only other thing to consider I think is the ceiling at each employer for growth and job security."
"I would weigh what's most important to you -- now vs future. Right now you have work from home which is great; but if early retirement is important, I'd give it hard consideration. A lot of companies are pushing people back in the office, so that's not guaranteed either."
I had great difficulty with WFh.  You've listed a ton of opportunities with the RTO position.  Even if I loved WFH I'd take that.  It may even be worth relocating for.
"When I was fully remote I saved about $8k AUD per year (after tax) in travel costs, coffees and lunches out..

I believe WFH was a huge time and cost saver..

There were plenty of other benefits too, kids were home straight after school so we could go out in the evenings and we ate more healthy foods, less takeaways.."
pfff... 10K is nothing. 100% WFH baby!
If you hate your job then there's no question that you go back to the field you love. Money and WFH are not factors here IMO
Even if they offered to double my salary I would decline an offer if it required working in an office. WFH is priceless for me.
How much sooner would you retire with those 25% contributions? If it shaves 10 years off your career I say go for it. Otherwise work from home. You won't see much of a difference in a $10k annual salary bump.
"Only you can make the choice because we each assign a different value to remote work. In my current remote role, I wouldn't take double my salary to go back in office. I have a paid off home and 3 young kids and value time above all else."
"WFH for sure, the savings on time and money on the is worth more than 10k."
If you're ambitious take the new job with the bonuses. Sounds like a phenomenal opportunity. The only way I'd go with the WFH job is if the new commute will be unbearable.
115K WFH cmon man what kind of a question is this? Unless you're one of them talkative extrovert types in which case definitely 115K WFH bc everyone in the office will start to get annoyed by you.
I was gonna say wfh but that much of an employer contribution is incredible.
You already know the answer you are going to get in a work from home sub.
"I love working from home just like so many others. Its why you see so many people leaving jobs and starting over. 

But ill admit over the past 5 years things have changed because i work from home and its not all good. Some people are more disciplined then others. 

Im working at a new company now, and i do 4.5 days WFH. To be honest im excited for the in person experience but not dealing with it everyday. So many people have developed social anxiety, depression and weight gain among other issues from not having contact with the outside world. 

PS. Some people say they ""save so much money working from home!"" Until you realize they DoorDash a $30 meal every day."
"The difference in salary alone is NOT worth losing wfh, $10-15k a year is easily eaten up just going into the office. Accounting for gas, car maintenance, lunch each day, time spent commuting...etc it all adds up especially in HCOL area. The other benefit stuff you listed are worth a pause because you're comparing it to your current quality of life."
"I'd take the new job. It's a financial and career advancement win. You're bored. I hear you saying you like WFH, but I don't hear you saying it would be awful to work in an office. Another WFH job in your field would be easy to find if this gig doesn't work out."
"Given your situation, I would probably recommend to take the new offer, but only if the commute is reasonable and you don't have any home-life constraints like something with kids that makes it more necessary to work from home.

It sounds like a job you would enjoy more with much higher total compensation.

Edit: I just saw your edit. For a 25 minute commute, new job is worth it."
Wfh. You get to save on transportation costs. It's also more nice working from home.
"Just based on the title I would have said 10k at that salary is not going to make a difference in your life but going to the office versus WFH will make a huge difference in your work life balance. 
However, reading the rest of your post, the 401k contribution and healthcare benefits are interesting for sure. I would do the math to see how early you could truly retire. Maybe do a ""why"" line of questioning to help you identify what your end goal is and what your current fears are: ask yourself a question and keep asking why to the answer until you end up at the root of your reasoning. Good luck!"
$115k WFH all day
"I'm a big WFH proponent, but I think you should take the other job. The 401K component is absolutely huge. And the commute isn't bad at all."
Go for it.  Wfh till you retire will make you a weirdo in the long run.  People need to interact even though most days I don't want too.
"What I save on gas and time is actually less than what I spend on heat and electricity when I choose to work from home,so I choose when the convenience outweighs the cost, a variable when I talk to some remote people they forget"
"So it's really 125k vs 182k. That said i'm guessing you didn't add in whatever 401k match you get on the current 125k. Let's go with a standard 4% (5k) and you're at 130 v 182 to compare total comp (not accounting for benefits).

I've been working from home for 10 years now and now that I have kids it's basically a necessity as I need to be able to get them on the bus in the morning and be home when they get off the bus. When they are older I would be able to do  hybrid or full in-office job.

If I were in your shoes and didn't have constraints that need WFH I would definitely take the new gig. 

A 50k increase in total compensation is a BIG deal. Add into that the compound growth of that extra $30k they will be directly contributing to you're retirement. Also don't forget to consider any future merit increases, which are % based. So the 10k higher base salary means for every 1% your salary is raised you are adding another $100 to your new salary vs the old one plus another $210 in additional 401k match. 

All of that considered if you forecast the 2 salaries out 5 or 10 years you're looking at a six-figure difference in total compensation between the 2 jobs and it gets you out of a boring job. 

Plus who knows where the future takes you. Maybe after spending some time in the new job you are able to WFH part or full time. 

I would take the new gig in a heartbeat."
"If you dislike your current WFH job now, and you think the new company has a good culture and interesting work, and if the commute is less than half an hour and with the total compensation being this high, I would probably make the move.

I love WFH, so at the very least I would try to negotiate 1 to 2 days a week of WFH, however I would probably settle for extra vacation. YMMV."
"For 10k? Stay at home all the way. If 125k company seemed super chill, and were close by I'd consider it, but most things the same I'd take a small cut to work from home. The cost savings in time and commutes is just hard to beat"
"The office is still expensive, even if you have a short commute. Remote workers network at a larger capacity and get more job offers down the line."
"Salaries are so close it's more of a personal call. Which jobs are you more interested in, do you like the manager of one more than the other and finally do you want WFH. No right answers but since you posted in this group I'd take a guess that the WFH is something you would want."
"Any chance you can find a WFH position making more money as well? I know this might not be helpful, but venting back a bit, WFH shouldn't be part of any compensation package imo as they actually save office space and on average remote workers are just as productive if not more. I hate that we've collectively accepted taking less money to WFH."
Wfh. It'll more than even out with lack of commute.
"As someone who absolutely loves WFH and the flexibility I'd take the new job. The 401k and health insurance alone is worth it I think at the same salary and the 10k extra is a nice sweetener. 

Also, sounds like you are a little bored with the current role and maybe it's time for a change. 25 minute commute isn't bad either. I think 30 minutes or less isn't bad. Worst case scenario is 2-3 years in this in office job and it sucks and maybe you go back to WFH or negotiate a hybrid situation?"
"Remote, 100%.

$10k doesn't cover direct costs of RTO, let alone the missing time or quality of life improvements WFH provides."
"Is my the work demanding or do you have a lot of free time once you complete your tasks? If you have a lot of free time, why not pick up a 2nd WFH job?"
"I'd stay remote.

In reality, I'd ask for MORE money for WFH.  You are technically saving company money."
"Well I was all ready to say never give up that work from home job, but it seems like a pretty sweet deal with the 401k esp if you plan to stay there a while. Also it seems like you'd be more passionate about the line of work which makes a huge difference. I'd say go for it"
"While I love WFH, I also think you have to enjoy what you do and that has value as well. Only you can decide, but the new job sounds what you have been looking for."
"Take the new office job. Making career moves and promotions is much harder to do WFH, and you said you're already bored. Comp change seems quite large too and your commute isn't bad. You're already living in HCOL as a remote employee, time to take advantage of what the HCOL area really offers, which is the local job market."
"The job opportunity and your passion trumps remote in this case imo. 

Wfh is about well-being. In my experience having a career you're passionate about, being part of something bigger and doing something really cool can help with overall well-being just as much as as WFH. And not too many things are cooler than putting satellites in space!"
"Damn.  So it's more than a 10k raise.  It's an extra $30k/year in your 401k, plus an extra 30k to cover healthcare. 

For 10k more I wouldn't even consider it.  For 70k more and flex hours.....if everything else checks out, it could be worth it.  Especially if you can flex hours to ease your commute and keep some balance.  

I took a 20% paycut to be fully remote and I have zero regrets.  But I can't say I wouldn't go back to the office a few days a week if someone offered me an extra 70-80k a year. 

Alternatively - moving could also give you a raise, if your WFH salary is location agnostic."
Wfh 100%
"Office job on paper makes more sense if you don't mind it.  The WFH job potential is better though in my opinion.  But in order to maximize that opportunity, you would definitely want to move to a LCOL area, perhaps even international.  You can live in luxury in Thailand for $1k a month easily if they allow you to do so, or if you can get away with it.  Or moving in with your parents, whatever.

Also locking in a remote job now can open the door for a second remote job later and you could easily surpass the compensation of the office job.  That would take a lot more work, but if it's a lazy/low intensity WFH job it can definitely be done."
"Take the interesting job you care about. The extra money is a bonus, but for me I cannot do work I'm uninterested in, remote or not. Actually even harder to WFH if you're ambivalent about the work."
"Does the 25k 401k contribution max out the 401k or can you still contribute? From the sounds of it, the commute isn't bad and you can still flex hours. The total comp is a life changer so the higher pay sounds pretty good. 
If they didn't offer the additional compensation, then the wfh would be my choice but that extra comp is pretty huge."
"You'll spend WELL over 10k per year in time and expense just commuting, even if it's close to you. WFH 100% here."
"Post title is misleading, the new job will pay a lot better in total comp. And it's in the field you're interested in. Both of those outweigh WFH to me, you should take it if offered."
"I'd take the new job.  WFH is great, but when commuting I found about 20 minutes to be perfect, especially if there's not a ton of traffic.  It's enough time to make a mental transition, and to listen to podcasts or language lessons or just some nice music.  But it's not long enough to create a lot of frustration.

And doing something interesting is worth more than what you're paid.  (As long as you're paid enough to support a decent lifestyle.)  And OP, it seems that you'll probably come out about even to start, with the cost of commuting.  And if I read your post correctly, the large 401k contribution makes the new job a better long term option.

Of course change is always hard.  And there's always a chance that a new job won't work out.  But if you're in a good stable financial position now, and if you have good marketable skills (which it seems that you do), then in this case the rewards seem to beat out the risks."
"115k remote is equal to or more money than 125k in office, if you're like the average person commuting by car.  10k or so is about how much an office worker would spend over a WFH person (of course some will spend more, some will spend less).  

Do the math including your commute fuel costs and time, extra vehicle wear and tear (or vehicle ownership period if the job would cause you to own a car that you otherwise wouldn't), food/coffee costs at office vs. at home... I don't know your specific circumstances, but you may very well find that it's that 10k difference or even more.

However, that 25% 401k contribution is huge, if it's the office job offering that, it might swing the pendulum back the other way."
I WFH for 10 years and gradually realized how bad it was for my physical health (so sedentary!) and my work/life balance. I work in an office now and it's been a positive shift for me in a number of ways. I do have the option to work from home as needed.
"There is almost no amount of money that would convince me to go back to working in an office.  Stick with WFH and keep looking to find a job you are excited about and pays better AND that let's you work from home, or ask for a raise or look into different roles at current company.  Working from home You save stress, time and money on commute, ""work"" clothing, household chores, etc."
id do $75K and work from home. best quality of life ever.
Not even a question. WFH 100%.
"Yep, the higher salary just helps with gas. The rest is planning ahead for the future. I was a WFH for 6 years, I took a field job to bump the base a bit, but the employer seeded 401K is what helps me plan for my retirement, verses bagging groceries at 80."
Save 4500 WFH vs 20k into his 401k at zero cost to him....
"I WFH and miss having an office to socialize, have free coffee and snacks, and generally feel like I have a hard break between work and home. Then again I now realize this is the WFH subreddit so they're asking a biased group."
"Did you not read the 25% of the salary into a 401k without any contributions, any money not used in healthcare is given back and the total comp would be closer to 180k?

At less than 25 minutes commute in a more interesting field to OP, I'd argue he should take the job

WFH is nice and all but the total comp package is honestly way too good for a short commute"
Due to the nature of the work there would be almost 0 flexibility unfortunately. It's all or nothing. I've only been WFH for two years but it feels like an eternity lol. I went to an office my entire career and now I'm scared to go back.
That's what I'm scared of. I feel lucky to be in the position I'm in and I'm not sure if this type of WFH opportunity would come around again.
Well technically I already have the WFH job. I'm asking if I should leave it
The older people in my life have told me to take the job for the potential early retirement and my younger friends have told me to keep my WFH. It's a very interesting thought experiment I've run into
"Personal preference, I'd not take that generous 401k and IBA benefits. I just want WFH, period. I had a very generous offer before, 30% base salary increase, 50% - 100% of annual salary bonus with the condition of 5 days in the office. After much thinking, I turned it down. Shortly after I got a much better business opportunity after that; thanks to WFH I have the flexibility to have a side business. I also feel much safer having more than 1 income stream. Just my personal experience though. I no longer care about industry or the work itself. Money is money to me. Working a job I could go only so far. OP mentioned industry preference as well. So it's really up to OP."
I feel like nobody is reading the second half of your post lol. The 401k and IBA sound pretty sweet. Your total comp is significantly higher it sounds like. At the end of the day it's really a question of if you want to work from home or not. Money doesn't buy happiness - I'd probably do the wfh thing personally but I'm at a point in my career where I don't care as much about growth as I do about enjoying my life.
"As someone full time in the office who used to be fully remote then hybrid... 

How much stuff are you able to get done during work hours? 

What time do you wake up for work, how much time is spent between waking up and starting work (do you wake up at 8:30 and start at 9?) 

Are you a morning person? Do you wake up and like to have a slow morning like me - aka need an alarm to go off an hour and a half before you leave for your commute or are you like my husband, up and out the door within 20 min?

25 min one way - is this with traffic? I am about 15 min from work no traffic but with rush hour I leave 30 min before because there are a lot of delays. 

1200 is a big diff considering the retirement and health benefits, but is it worth potentially 2 extra hours of your day and no getting stuff done even it's as small as unloading the dishwasher or tossing in a load of laundry? 

Personally, not much would trump work from home for me at this point. The time and mental health benefits are just unbeatable. It seems like you make a good salary, are you able to pay all your bills or would 1200 be life changing for you? Is approx 15k worth all of the things you will lose?"
The post should have stated $110k package to WFH or $185k to go back to an office. The devil is in the detail in the details which go unnoticed In Reddit.
Reddit is so bias with remote work. They'll advise you take a $50k remote job over a $200k in office job because they can do their laundry at lunch
"Maybe, maybe not. Once you have established yourself for a year or two at the WFH job, you will suddenly realize that you can literally live ANYWHERE in the country that you want. Talk about freedom! 20 acres in the Mountains of Montana? Sure, why not!

Hawaii? Sure. St. Thomas? Why the hell not? Or move to a very nice, friendly, scenic but low COL place like Appalachia and be a HUGE fish in a small pond! All you need is a reliable internet connection, and these days, that's everywhere! If you have to hop on a jet once or twice a year, so what? They are literally offering you more freedom than you have ever known in your entire life, and for six figures at that! Do you have any idea how far a six-figure income goes in say Wheeling, WV, small-town or smaller cities in  Pennsylvania or Ohio, or even Charleston, SC? You would be one of the local rock stars there. If you are single, you would instantly become the most eligible bachelor in town.

We live in Delaware County, PA, we both WFH and between my wife and I, we are like 100% above the median income here. Even living in Philadelphia, you would be a high earner living in one of the best neighborhoods in the city."
"I seriously doubt it. I am a very skilled, hard working, talented and productive software developer with a clearance. I can get a full time WFH job anywhere, anytime. I get recruited 16x a week on LinkedIn."
"Yea I feel that way too, they just read the title and first sentence and go ""oh obviously you should stay WFH"""
"You have to be careful with that though, because 1) generally companies have to have payroll established in any states where employees permanently reside, so that may limit your options, and 2) Companies will not hesitate to screw you over on a moment's notice with RTO. The guy who I replaced at my current job was WFH in FL (he may have even been hired that way, I'm not sure), and then out of the blue the company told him he had a month to figure out how to come in to the office in NYC 3 days a week or he could find another job. So he quit. He had some of the best numbers on our team too, and the company just let him walk out the door simply because he wouldn't help them justify their commercial real estate investment. 

Not saying that this would happen to you, but I would still approach 100% WFH offers with a bit of caution."
"It's really up to you regarding to 401k or IBA. Even with that generous 401k and IBA, I'd rather take the WFH option and have a side business. My side business makes double my WFH job. I've been able to max out 401k, HSA, and back door Roth IRA, helped my family, donated to charity, and now am saving for a downpayment for my dream home.

Having a WFH job is a base for me in terms of stable cash flow and benefits. I personally don't see much earnings growth potential with a job having worked in corporate for several years."
"WFH from there 5  years, sell it and then you can buy your next house almost anywhere in the country with CASH."
"What sacrifice are you talking about? Bro, it's a 50-minute commute driving to and from work. 

The WFH crowd needs to stop the extreme rhetoric that their perceived discomfort to ever be in office is true for everyone, much like they preach that not everyone has the desire to work in an office."
"These Reddit Names - Damn.

* Piglet was always too reasonable. He is a SIMP anyway.

* And this dude is calling himself stupid(Bumpkin).

Anyway as a Remote worker - 
* motherf------ take the office job. That's cash comp. Forget the maybe money, get the guaranteed money.

u/reasonable_piglet, you would have to be a fool not too."
"It's literally a waste of time and you're investing for your 60yo self instead of enjoying life in the present instead. You don't touch your 401k till then.

I'm not saying don't invest, but moving jobs just for a better 401k is silly. Invest elsewhere once you max your current contributions. It's 50min of pure driving, not including the time to get ready and presentable before then, not counting the time to decompress after your drive home, etc.

But lets just say 1 hour wasted a day. That's 200-260 hours a year of just sitting in traffic or preparing for work. Not including all the hours wasted sitting in an office instead of being able to cook and clean on the clock, or even run errands. So shopping that needs to be done after work now adds to your total wasted time. Breakfast has to be done before you go to work, or spend money buying it on the way. Lunch has to be made in advanced, or you again spend more money to buy it made for you.

Wasted money on gas. Wear and tear on a car you'll have to replace sooner rather than later, plus maintainance. 

You'd waste an entire fucking year just driving by the time you retire, if not more. 

It's not an extreme rhetoric. WFH gives you advantages unlike any other job."
"My dad gets it; he's a corporate exec and has WFH on and off for quite a while. Despite that, my mom does not lol. If I'm working from their house, my mom fully expects me to drop everything to help bring in groceries, help with dinner, etc. 

Weirdly, my grandma who is almost 90 seems to get it the best? She's never used a computer and has no knowledge of office jobs but if I'm working from her house she knows that if the door is closed I'm not to be disturbed, and if I'm out and chatting then I'm on a break."
"Contrary to most, my dad (mid 60s) has embraced remote work and has the sickest home set up to teach his classes. He learned how to edit his own videos, learned about lighting and audio, and I'm currently helping him with OBS and setting up his green screen. He loves it and is really excited to make his online teaching high quality and to have it mimics the media his students use. He even is using AI and interactive learning programs with his classes.

I wish my coworkers were as interested in improving their understanding of running live virtual meetings and training. I'm listening to an HR meeting right now and they forgot to share the slides with the virtual audience."
"My friend has 2 kids and assumes that people who work from home don't need childcare at all because they can watch the kids while they're working. 

That's probably one of the quickest ways to get fired from a remote job.... boss still needs you to be available and a constant crying baby in the back of your meetings is gonna look fishy."
"No, they don't. Even my neighbor thinks I am jobless and leeching the government because I work from home."
"My parents don't understand, but from a different angle. They somehow think that if I work from home, it's not a ""real job.""  I am in my mid 40s, make $240k annually as a contractor for numerous companies, and have worked 100% remotely since 2016.  I live alone, in a 3 bedroom condo, with two dogs. I am doing better than a majority of people in the United States right now.  I plan to retire in my mid 50s, barring any disaster. This isn't to brag, but to explain the issues I have explaining the ludicrous behavior of my parents. I loathe bragging, mostly because it's the people that HAVE to brag about their salaries that irk me. 

Last Christmas, the first time I'd seen them in 3 years, my dad (who works as an insurance adjuster) said he could pull some strings and get me a job working in his office for a $60k/year.  I explained, again, I am employed and doing very well. I don't need a job.  The fact that I have long hair, work from home, and work on computers somehow confounds them like some selective senility. Every time we meet, eventually it gets to this, ""you need to take your life seriously"" speech. You know, married, with kids, working in an office. It's the ""working in an office"" that really seems to be the philosophical hurdle they can't jump. Like they just can't comprehend I am doing very well financially working from home. And after half an hour of explaining how much I make, what my daily life is like, and how blessed I am to be in this career... hours later... ""well, so-and-so works for Capital One, and he's got a nice house. He's only in his 30s and has his own office already. You can get a job like that if you applied yourself...""

My dad works in an office.  Day in and day out. Same place for 15 years, I think. He considers having his own office a source of pride and accomplishment, and great!  Good for him. He's happy. He's apparently very good at his job. My mom is retired from teaching, and works as a choral director for some volunteer choir.  Both are in their late 60s, and outright own their house that had probably 10x the value the purchased it for in the early 80s. I don't rag on them, but they act like they have to ""get me back on track"" and I am in denial about my living situation.  And frankly, I don't want to flap my salary around like some checkered flag in their faces, because it feels rude.  But goddamn, guys. Working a GOOD JOB from home is a REAL THING now.  I am not stuffing envelopes and selling plasma or something."
"OMG yes, and it's especially frustrating since my mom has been WFH throughout the pandemic! (She recently retired as a teacher at a school for learning disabled students, and continued on with tutoring part time.) I'm like - do you see my headset on and mic flipped down? Do you see me deep in concentration?

And then she gets all angrily impatient waiting to interact if I signal I can't engage right then - and it's always for something super important like ""we should walk the dogs before 7 pm or it'll get dark before we get back."""
"I'm on the opposite side, my dad WFH 80-90% of the time for the last 10ish years before he retired. My wife and I would spend a week at a time at my folk's place during the pandemic. My folks would really only interrupt us if they were making lunch to ask us what we wanted. But they'd definitely wait to make sure we weren't in a meeting and just try get our attention lightly of we had our headsets on."
Yes. All my relatives didn't understand it. I WFH & took care of my grandma & eventually had to stop doing that due to it impacting my career bc rude family members would continue to act like I wasn't working while I was in meetings.
"I'm 63 (60 @ start of COVID) my dad is 87.

I spent a substantial amount of time at this house (I live in TX, he lives in MN) during 2021 and 2022 doing WFH. Not one time was he confused about how I was working and not in the office."
"My mother-in-law lives with us and every few months I have to remind her not to yell up the stairs or across the house. Although, even if I didn't WFH I'd still hate it."
"Not the exact same thing, but my grandma thinks we all have the same job since we WFH. I'm in consulting, my brother is a software engineer, and my sister works in marketing. Our jobs are not alike by any means, but to my grandma, ""her jobs is like yours...she works at home on the computer, like you."""
"I WFH and live with my mom and brother, I don't have a spare room so I took over the dining room which has 3 closed walls so I got a room divider curtain to close it in. They can't seem to grasp the concept of leave me alone while I'm working, or to pretend like I'm not here while the curtain is closed. And it never fails that they always need something when I'm on a call or in a meeting on cam. It's so embarrassing when I see them peak in the curtain which is behind me, like they can't hear that I'm actively on a call and should assume that means on cam, no matter how many times I tell them. It's so frustrating. I need to get a new desk so I can setup so my back isn't to the curtain or just move to my bedroom. You would think they would give my job some importance given all it pays for, which is just about everything. But no."
"My mom gets it because she WFHs permanently now but my husband still doesn't understand that when I'm on the clock, I am on the clock. He still says things like ""are you going to work today?"" as if my office isn't two minutes into our kitchen."
"Hahaha when I stayed at my aunt's for a few weeks 'till an apartment opened up, I had 2 wfh jobs. One of them was tutoring Chinese kids in ESL. I was planning on using her little computer nook to work. My 70-something aunt, who is a retired school administrator of all things, pokes her head in behind me to see what I was doing and the student sees her. BIG no no. She got a very mild chewing out, bc after all, I was crashing on her couch, and I started teaching my lessons with noise canceling headphones sitting on the couch with my back to the wall, that way people didn't have to creep or belly crawl behind me to get by. She saw me waking up at all hours of the night to teach, as I was picking up extra classes to get more $, and complimented me on my work ethic and teaching methods with the kids."
"My (GenX) parents (Boomers) have no trouble comprehending my WFH.  My grandmother (Silent Generation) just never understood that even though I was home, I was working. To be fair, she has dementia and can't remember what we talked about 20 minutes prior so IDK what her thoughts would be if she didn't have dementia. 

Now, my Millennial and Gen Z kids (and the Millennial is by far the WORST about it) ... those are the ones who absolutely cannot wrap their heads around the idea that from 8a - 5p on the days I WFH they need to act like I am not here and figure things out for themselves.  I do not need to know that you are going to wash a load of towels, that you can't find anything you want to eat for lunch or that you're bored.  The door to my home office is closed, just like it is on the days when I go to my physical office, just pretend I'm not on the other side of the door that day."
"Both my wife and I are WFH and have relatively flexible schedules as we both own our own businesses. While our families aren't rude about it, they're still confused sometimes when I say ""stop by whenever"" like ""so, you don't have to work today?""....no, just because I'm at home and still in my pajamas doesn't mean I'm not working."
"My mom is 81 and she WFH. Been doing it 11-12 years. It's half time but she's still at it. Keeps her busy, keeps her mind going. She'll go another year or two before she calls it a day. I WFH too at her house. We each have our own space and interrupt the other infrequently."
"I just switched from a mostly full WFH job to a full time onsite and my dad goes ""oh so it's a real job this time"" lol. His industry can't really be remote so he doesn't get it"
"I'm a university professor. Very few people accept that I am working when I am not actually in a classroom teaching. They do not accept that I have long preferred to work in my home office. I have explained this to my mother for over twenty years and to this day she still acts surprised, and a bit miffed, when I tell her that I'm in the middle of something and I will have to call her back later. Twenty. Years."
"To my boomer dad's credit, he is great when I wfh at his place. He also works from home too, so I respect his boundries and just text if I need to reach him and the door is closed. 

If someone else doesn't respect my boundries, I just flat out set them, ask them if they seem fair, get them to agree, then either remind them or set repurcussions if not followed.

1st Conversation: ""I'm asking you not to knock or disturb me during my work day outside of a life threatening emergency, your disturbamces impact my job negatively. Does that make sense? Will you agree not to?"" 

1st Disturbance: ""What's the emergency...? Asking me the neighbors name is not an emergency. We agreed you wouldn't disturb me outside of an ermegency right?""

2nd Disturbance: ""I really feel like you're not respecting my boundries. We both had an agreement and you're not keeping your end. Do we need to change the agreement? I don't think I can continue to work here if you keep interrupting me. This really bumms me out because I like staying here. Looks like I need to head to a cafe or home if you don't stop. ""

3rd Disturbance: At the end of the day, their house, their rules. Politely explain why you are leaving based on you feeling them not respecting your boundries. Leave."
"Boomer here. I did WFH before it was a thing (field sales/tech rep in the 80's). Yeah, I get it. Had to lay down the law to my small kids that when daddy was at his desk, do not bother him unless you're dead."
"Yes exactly, though the term is WFH, we are working as if we are inside the office. The mindset of people are different, they think that working from home is not literary working but can work with flexibility. Maybe true for some but for many, working from home is always like working from office, they are fun sometimes. They do not see the difference at all. They are blinded that WFH is an easy job compared to working from office"
I never liked WFH because *I* don't want to turn over my home to my office. I want to be able to relax at home and have a dedicated space for my job. I feel like it's an inappropriate encroachment on my personal space if I wfh.  And I think that's what a lot of older people are used to: home is home and work is work.
"I'm sorry, did you say you went to visit your parents for a long weekend and then took it upon yourself to WFH in their house, and you're upset they walked into the room of their house you're using to NOT visit them?

Seriously?

Take your job-worshipping ass home, come back when you want to visit with your parents.

Some people's kids, I swear."
"If you need absolute privacy, lock the door, or go work at a coffee shop or some other shared space.  The WFH has disadvantages, and that is one of them.  Your parents can do whatever the fuck they want in their own home.  

And wtf is ""in a flow"", lol, that is so damn pretentious."
"Most of the boomers I know were in tech and invented a lot of the stuff that makes work from home possible.  But that's because most of the people that I know are in tech.

My parents certainly get it (75 & 80).  But I've been WFH for 20 years now.

But yea I know some people that don't get it - and that crosses all generations."
"Thankfully mine get it, my mom was remote before she retired and thankfully they never fully broke down the home office setup (with French doors I can  through, thankfully) she was using. Maybe try posting a sign on the door when you're in a meeting and can't be interrupted? Gotta take it back to what they know sometimes lol"
"I'm a boomer who very occasionally had a wfh day, and did after-hours support at home (IT). It was pretty taboo back then since some in the department HAD to be onsite and their jealousy forced my boss to stop wfh. Since I retired, the organization changed their outlook on wfh (before Covid), and if I was still working, I'd be working at home. I never really liked working from home, but I'm sure I'd get used to it if I had to."
"My spouse and I took my mom in about 5 years ago.. We both work from home, in different fields. I'm in content editing, and he's in web dev. He's got the bigger, more complex job involving coding - you **can't** interrupt him during his work day as his door is shut. Same for me, but mine's a bit more creative so you can interrupt me sometimes and I won't get mad. 

But we've had to enforce boundaries aggressively at the start. ""No, get out. I can not talk right now."" ""It's not before 5pm, I'm not available."" We don't now, in fact she'll text to ask to come visit us during the day now. 

I'd only tolerate that kinda stuff with her. If any of our family, or her friends do anything that interrupts us, I'm just blunt and insist on them leaving, without caring if they think I'm rude or not."
"I had an internship with the government my senior year of college my dad had a tough time understanding it but he figured it out eventually. My mom on the other hand didn't understand pretty much the entire time I had it.

I stayed at home during college so I'd work from home at their house. My dad initially just assumed I was never busy and often times would come in to my room to talk while I was in meetings but eventually he realized that if I was in my room I was probably busy and he'd text and ask if he could come in. I was proud of him for it cause he's worked blue collar jobs his entire life and struggles with computers 

Like I said earlier my mom never understood it despite her job being one she could've done from home. Every time she'd talk about my internship it was pretty much a ""I don't do anything and sit at home all day"" which wasn't entirely wrong but I still did do work. She never seemed to grasp that I couldn't just go an do anything I wanted"
"Both my sister and I WFH. My older boomer dad often says, ""I just don't get the WFH thing"" and shakes his head but at least he's honest about it. He also has sent an email exactly once in his life so we interpret his comments accordingly. "
"After 5 years of WFH my wife still doesn't get that if the door is closed, do not come in. I'm probably in a meeting. I started locking it and she got mad that it was locked and would knock on the door loudly to get me to do stuff. So frustrating."
"It's not a boomer thing. My husband (gen x) could not get it through his head either. If he saw me on the computer, and there was no one on zoom he would stroll in for a chat cause ""you're not doing anything right now"". Before I got this WFH position and had an Etsy shop that I easily put in 10h a day into, he would always say I didn't work cause I ""was at home"". I think in his case it's because he was used to manual labour so if you're sitting down or not actively typing ""you're not working"". It took him a while to finally understand that even if I'm not actively typing, I may be reading, cross checking, or monitoring... and that's doesn't mean we can chat right now."
"There's something I learned over a long career: your parents will never quite understand exactly what you do if you work in the STEM world. Doctor, lawyer, plumber, English teacher sure, but software engineer, environmental consultant, petrochemist, data scientist, etc. and it is bit of a blur. A lot of those latter sorts of jobs can be done at least partially in a WFH environment, so it is not surprising that they continue to be mysteries. The funny thing for me was when I began working for a FAANG, however; then my parents had something to glom onto."
"Yup, it is difficult to work from home with parents. My grandmother calls for my aunt every 30 mins in the middle of important meetings."
"I'm an older millennial, my husband and I can work from home. If someone is on a call, we won't enter that room unless necessary and it will be preceded by a knock and check. No call, it's a free for all because it's part of our home. Go to the office if you don't want to be interrupted by the people that live with you."
"This is not a generational issue in regards to WFH. This is an issue of owner vs employee. When they owned a business and ""worked"" from home, their time was literally their own, since they owned the business. It is not the same for you. They need to understand that you are on the clock and that tour employer expects you to be able to work without interruptions."
"Not just family, but yes. They don't get it. I am actually working. No, I am not doing laundry, unloading the dishwasher, preparing dinner, walking the dog, watching TV, chit chatting on the phone, running errands, picking up prescriptions, in line at the post office, or anything else. I'm not poolside lakeside beach side. I'm on my backside at my desk.

I am working. From home. Working.

I'm kind of jealous of the WFH people who have time for anything else."
"Yeah a lot of the older generation thinks you must be casually working if you're at home because an office is where ""real"" work gets done.

My parents currently work hybrid and they still share that mindset half the time. Before the whole remote work surge - my dad and people from his generation really only believed in working from home if they had a light schedule/basically no work to do. Since working in this decade, he sort of gets that remote work is just as busy as a 9-5 in an office but that's because he's seen both sides of remote work from back then & current."
"I am 4 years too young to be a boomer according to the age charts I've seen. But I'm not far off. I WFH exclusively, although I don't currently have a job. Just because someone is older doesn't mean we don't understand remote work."
"Yep, not only my MIL, but surprisingly, or not, my DIL and grandson. None of them can comprehend to not call me or interrupt me during the day. For some reason, people can't seem to grasp WFH."
"My parents are both retired, but my mom was a knowledge worker who did a lot of WFH and my dad was a blue collar worker, so he doesn't really get it."
"I believe that it might depend on their background.
I'm in my 60s and had a long career in technology.
Over 20 years ago, we were working from home.  It was called Telecommuting then and I did tech support and software training for our clients."
"In my experience if someone ""doesn't understand your work from home"" it's because you haven't been rude enough to them about it. "
"First day I worked from home (7.5 years ago), my wife came home and was upset that I hadn't done any laundry or washed the dishes.  I pointed out that she hadn't either, and she said ""But you've been home all day!"".  Almost 8 years later and she STILL doesn't treat my wfh job like a real job."
"I'm GenX and work from home most days. My mid-20s kids show up and literally walk into my video call. Both know how this stuff works so not sure this is a generational thing. 
Oh, dogs are clueless, too."
"My dad works from home 2 days a week as a manager and complains productivity is down and who knows if people are really working? 

I caught him doing chores by the pool during one of his work from home days."
"My mom is a boomer and did remote work before the COVID lockdowns. My exMIL was doing remote work long before my mom did. I actually worked a contract with her back in the early 2000's at her home office. We only went in for 2 meeting at the headquarters. Also was on a cruise with a couple of boomers who were on a working vacation. Where they worked part of the day and had fun the reat of the day. They were working on a fucking cruise.

Pretty sure this is just a generalization. Boomers introduced me to remote working."
"My mom WFH 15 years ago, but even if she hadn't, I can't imagine her disregarding my request not to be interrupted. She's super respectful that way.

Eta: my mom is 74"
"Only people who have WFH get it, and even then they might not. 

Ive been WFH for over a decade. Family gets home before 4 most days and I get a lot less done after 4. 

We recently bought a new home. Home office is built above the detached garage. The physical separation helps, but still get interrupted a lot. 

When I'm working on the road like you described, I make sure there's at least a coffee shop or somewhere for me to go."
"Still people think because I WFH that I make my own schedule. I am expected to be available 8-5, like if I have an appointment during the day because that is when I can get in I just give my team members a heads up so that if the client sends in hot ticket that they should expect me back about X time."
"My dad gets it, but constantly has shit to say about it. ""I could never do that. People need to be in an office."" Mind you, he's the list anti-social recluse if an IT guy I've ever met. So the office is the only place he sees people he's not related to. I'm betting it has something to do with that.

In his mind, it just doesn't make sense. But he at least understands that people like it, and he isn't against WFH. Just doesn't get why anyone would actually want to do it."
"Hey, hey, maybe your parents don't understand but this boomer has been WFH for 27 years when we were sent home because they ran out of space at the office and the internet was dial up.  Actually, at that time we were hybrid and went full WFH for 23 years."
">However, the only viewpoint they have is from their own business. In their mind, if I am home, I should feel like I am at home.

TBH, this seeems like they are being deliberately ignorant so you can accommodate their needs while they are with you. 

My parents are older too, but if they are over I tell them I WFH full time, and they might not understand but they respect it. They always ask ""is it okay to talk to you?"" or ""are you done with work"". Stuff like that."
"My 82 year old mom doesn't get it. She doesn't understand that the work being done is online and time sensitive. The only work she ever brought home (before she retired) was to enter data onto a spreadsheet and save to a floppy disk. She has no concept of online meetings. I don't know how since she was around the house when her grandkids were doing distance learning. She thinks WFH is not real, and it's an excuse to get out of doing stuff around the house while at home."
"I'm not sure why you have to say ""boomers"".  Seems to me it's just YOUR parents or any type person in a home that doesn't understand you're working.  Could be a child, a spouse, the dog, etc.  I've read plenty of posts where someone is complaining that their ""work"" time isn't respected while doing it from home.  That's just the downside of WFH."
I told my dad I was looking for remote work and he became very upset. He thought remote meant remote location. He thought I was trying to move far away. I'm dead serious. It happened like a week ago.
"It doesn't have to be an older person. I'm Gen X and had someone my age stop by my house one day (a few years ago, pre-Covid). It was summer so I was in shorts and t-shirt and she asked if I had the day off. I said no, I work from home. She was surprised ""you're working!?!"" and then asked ""what do you do again?"" because it was such an alien concept to her."
"Many posters here are confusing lack of respect for lack of understanding. 

These ppl do not respect or value your wishes so they do as they pleases. It's three years past Covid and mandatory start of wfh. You think these ppl three years in are just to dumb to figure it out ?"
"Went to visit my boomer parents. I am WFH. They interrupted me every about 20-30 min or so like I wasn't working or something. My dad also (who also WFH) says working from home is terrible and we need people back to the office. When asked why he said things aren't getting done, people on phones during meetings, would take their phones away if he had the power to etc etc..he is their manager. So I told him it sounds like a leadership issue not a WFH issue."
"My 17 year daughter doesn't get it. She'll used to come in to my office several times a day, see that I am actively in the middle of typing or talking and just start talking to me about anything on her mind. Then she doesn't understand why I'm not listening and why I'm mad. 

My mom has often referred to it as ""work"". I hated that. 

(I no longer have a WFH job and I regret my decision to leave for more pay everyday)"
"It's not Boomers who don't know or are clueless, it is a respect issue. That can be any age. I had my own business 25 years ago and worked from home. Had 3 other people and we all worked from home. We used instant messenger to be in contact during the day. Or phone calls. I am tired of people always saying Boomers don't get this or that. A previous boss was 20 years younger then me (35 yo) and he was adamant about NO WFH for anyone. He was a micromanager."
"Boomers don't have a problem with WFH. There are many boomers who indeed WFH.

What your parents have is a problem with boundaries. But I also think that because you are visiting them they likely didn't expect you to work so much. How often do you visit and do you do it out of obligation? So many things at play here.

My parents always visited me and most of the time I had to work. They didn't have a problem with it. Typically they were out all day seeing the sites and we'd all meet up at my home and have dinner together. As they got older and could no longer travel I visited them more often but sometimes still had to work. My dad once asked why did I work so much but didn't interfere with my work. But he was worried about the number of hours I worked.

Even in hospice where my sister's and I stayed with my dad around the clock because we didn't want him to be alone, I stayed with him thru the night and I'd still work in the wee hours when he slept. But I was still bedside.

But these days I wish I had not. My company merged with another and I lost my job. My job loss was not because of performance but because I said no to being taken advantage of and saying no to an approach the client wanted but I could not defend. My hard work, good client relationships and loyalty was not reviewed. I was kicked out and another person was given my projects to manage.

Learned then that loyalty is not rewarded especially when circumstances change. 

Perhaps if you can let them know that while you're visiting you need a block of time free to work. If it's your vacation but you're still working then that's on you. If you own your own business then that's a totally different ball game and you may need to work if you left someone in charge and they need an assist while you're away.

But this not a generational issue but a boundary issue."
"I live alone. But when my family visits they are fully respectful of my work from home. They knock lightly if my doors closed, or text me if they need to ask me something."
"Mine get it. My dad (late 60s) spent the last 5 or years of his career working hybrid and the last 6 months fully remote (because he broke his ankle and his bosses felt it was easy enough for him to work at home so why make a man on crutches commute). My mom was a teacher, so she saw him remote working when she was home for summer. My brother and I are both 100% remote and they definitely get it. When they visit me or when I visit time, they know that a closed door means do-not-disturb (and will ask ""why aren't you working?"" if I'm on a break)."
I'm hybrid. My mom keeps saying I work on Tuesday & Friday and don't work on Wednesday & Thursday when those days are actually WFH. And she'll call me randomly on Wed & Thurs to chat. She absolutely thinks I'm not seriously working those 2 days.
"I don't think its ""boomers"", its pretty much anyone who doesn't have a WFH type job.  My neighbors were always confused, they are 10 years younger than me.  They thought we were just goofing off at home.  To them computers were only used for games and the other thing. So the thought someone would actually just sit in front of a computer and do real work, just didn't compute. 

Now I've been at least part time WFH for 30 years and we are certainly helping cause the confusion.  We are the people that are at the pool at 10AM, chilling while WFH or mowing the lawn.  We work for companies that don't care how or when you get your hours in for the week.  I do a lot of international calls so lots of 8-10PM calls, 6-8AM calls, so Im not working 9-5.  My BF downloads massive video files and it just becomes easier for him to start and go do personal things.  

Now if our door is closed, we are not to be disturbed and that is understood."
"Both my boomer parents are fairly tech savvy and both had to WFH during the height of the pandemic. Now that I think about it, most of the things boomers are criticized for don't apply to my parents. I guess I got lucky in that department."
"My step Dad (Boomer) and my Mom (Silent Gen) both understand WFH isn't a play day. My dad WFH for the last decade of his career, at least 1 day a week. So everyone was familiar with that, and not going into his office while he was working. I frequently WFH from my mom's sofa, I just let her know when I have meetings so she doesn't walk in and start talking to me."
"Yes, my parents certainly do. My parents have their own business and work from home so they undrestand the concept. My dad also worked remotely from time to time before he retired. I know if they try to contact me while I'm working, it's urgent."
"Idk about wfh but my mother ex law never could understand how restaurant jobs worked. She would always want to know what time I would be off. Every time I would tell her that idk for sure but sometimes around x:xx probably. I worked swing shift at a 24 hour cafe at the time so getting off work an hour or two late was not unheard of at all. That didn't stop her from blowing my phone up though. She just couldn't grasp the fact that if it's busy enough for me to have to stay late, that means it to busy for me to talk on the phone."
"WFH or not, I always got phone calls from family/friends while at work. I refuse to take the calls unless it's an emergency. Unlike, 95% of coworkers. Yes, I'm old school! From 3 to 40 employees over 40 years, there isn't a day I walk by multiple offices and peeps are on their cell phones. Work? Personal? Fantasy football?"
"Absolutely. I'm going on maternity leave soon and have had multiple family members, all over the age of 55 asked me why I'm planning to put the baby in day care when I work from home. My response is always ""what happens when she inevitably starts crying during a call or presentation?"" ""Oh, I hadn't thought about that."" "
"Your initial question is very disrespectful to the generation that brought you the tools for WFH. Cell phones, personal computers, the Internet, the Web, HVAC-R in economic reach of almost everyone. We had a meeting and you're out. Turn in everything we invented. 

Respect for the workplace is independent of age. Lots of Gen X and Gen Z don't get it, including people who are supposed to be working from home. Thus the market for things like mouse jigglers (isn't that something for your generation to be proud of?) and the ongoing discussions of long naps, workouts, and abbreviated work days. 

You don't live with your parents. You visited and planned one work day. It was a failure. Now you know. Don't plan that way anymore. You're unlikely to change them and that isn't because of their age but who they are. I'm unlikely to change your ageism. It isn't worth getting energized over. 

My wife and I WFH. I've been doing it for 15 years. My wife nearly 30 years. We knock gently on each others doors. We use texts, IM, and email to avoid interrupting each other. Notes. When we encounter one another around the house we start with ""do you have a minute?"" My FIL approaching 90 gets it when he visits. My nieces on the other hand do not. They want their privacy but don't value that of others. Shall we talk about entitled young people? 

The point is that you're attributing to age something that is not correlated. Lots of statistics in media and advertising. You should get that. Normal distributions and statistically significant populations. You're making invalid and presumptive assumptions so all your conclusions are unsubstantiated."
"My dad ended up WFH for most of the pandemic before getting a new job. My husband and I moved in with them for two months after selling our home and waiting to move into our new one. I was full WFH and he would constantly come chat with me, ask me to come look at something or do something for him (I work in IT, so I was his tech support). I had to constantly remind him I needed to be available at my computer and couldn't just randomly leave. He'd fuck around most of the day (go practice his golf swing, work around the house, etc)."
"My uncle doesn't get it... he is suppose to be coming to visit for the first time. He asked me when will I be home from work and I told him I'm always home unless I'm running an errand since I WFH. Then he asked follow up questions like if I am always working, what I did, etc... this is the man that knew I was studying computers and graphic design way back in high school and college. Though this is also the man who finally got a computer in 2006, stored it in the humid ass guest room and drank coffee at the desk while trying to blame me I had something to do with it when I said I would take a look to see what the matter was... the motherboard literally was fried and it was a Gateway computer... those things were garbage."
"I mean, wives and husbands constantly interrupt each other when working. Usually not on calls, but otherwise yes, even though they themselves WFH. And also kids and of course pets (the latter may not understand you're on a call). This is one of the downsides of WFH, and why I sometimes go to the office."
My parents get it thankfully. My mom is a corporate exec that is WFH. My dad bless his heart never interrupts but sometimes takes the being quiet while someone is working too seriously and is like tip toeing through the kitchen when I'm in the back office working lol.
"My parents and grandparents understand nothing, they just blindly repeat talking points they hear about WFH being bad."
"You're in the wrong - most WFH folks here don't actually work, they just watch their kids and visit with family."
"I do 1 day in the office and 4 WFH (or sometimes  5 WFH days it doesn't matter).

Anyway my wife works an odd schedule 3 days travel and 4 off. She definitely treats days we are home together as days she can have my attention and things here and there. While I typically CAN do that it's not the assumption. Door is closed, don't even bother knocking please!"
"It's a mix of not understanding/believing that WFH is work because ""well you're home, right?"" and retirees completely losing the concept of time. My parents recently retired and don't understand why we can just *drive* out to see them for a week on the other side of the country, as though in addition to taking a week off of work I have additional PTO I can just blow on an extracurricular road trip."
"My dad did WFH during COVID, now he does hybrid 3/2 because he has to do some physical computer troubleshooting and fixing. He 100% gets WFH. My mom couldn't WFH (admin stuff at hospital, checking ppl in and such) but she still gets it. If I'm working and she is off, she will ask if she can come drop something off. (Older Gen X parents) 

My grandmother? 0 understanding of WFH. Luckily she hasn't done it much, but she has stopped by unannounced before and I'm like, I'm working?? Can't just have you stop by to show me a bunch of crap you got for at a yard sale?? I think my mom helped drill it in she can't do that bc she didn't really listen to me"
I wfh exclusively and neighbors will just stop by bc they know I'm home.  Really irritating when I'm on a client call - I have a ring camera so I can mute my work call and tell folks I'm in a meeting
"Honestly yeah they really don't get it.

Sometimes I'll go visit them and work from home at their house and my mom will just ask me mid day to go run errands with her or to go do something fun. Sometimes they forget that working from home still means I'm working."
"I'm sure they get it, but if you have to work from home, it really ought to be your own home :)"
"From multiple people, not all boomers (but boomer is just a mindset).

Before WFH, a long time ago, I did freelance on the side. While visiting my parents, I was still handling some back-and-forth requests for a client. My dad was wanting my help that day to get some light work done outside, but I had to postpone it because I had an urgent edit that needed done in the morning. He came in my room frequently throughout that whole morning, agitated that we were not going to have time enough to get our work done. I had to stand up and walk him out the door and shut it. And guess what? When I was done, my dad's task took all of an hour.

I also have friends from out of state who recently moved closer and have been inviting me to visit. I did, twice, for just a weekend, taking off a Friday on one of them for a long weekend, and they asked ""oh, why don't you come and stay for a week? You can work while you're here."" And I'm like ""nah."" Besides needing concentration, I also work on a large second monitor with peripherals. I do layout and graphics work, and depending on the workflow step, working on a tiny laptop with a trackpad is just out of the question. They still don't seem to understand. 

And yet another set of people, an older boomer couple that is relatives of a friend of mine, I heard commenting on some of my freelance work while I was in the other room. They were very surprised that I had a client in another country, as if they thought I just dinked around on a computer all day, they had no concept that I was actually doing work that affected others."
My mom wants me to take her to her appointments and go grocery shopping when I work from home
When I would visit my mom and WFH she would say 'shouldn't you be working' if I wasn't at my desk. I guess she gets it. Lol
"Yea that's what doors are for, I work from home with my wife and if the doors closed I'll only knock if it's important. OP needs to close the door and put a sign that says live on air or something lol"
"Grandma probably gets it because at the  end of the day you don't have to understand the work, or computers, or anything else to understand ""If the door is shut, I'm working."" 

It's more about understanding and respecting boundaries than understanding ever aspect of remote work."
I mean when I was wfh I was basically just on call to resolve various issues after I'd finished my daily work schedule
"i had a family member call my mom last night to tell her that they're worried about me working from home because i've ""turned into a hermit"" and ""don't have interpersonal skills or friends."" 

nah, i am grown enough to not be obligated to attend their gossipy family parties. they're pissed that i get to work in my pajamas and easily make ends meet while they sit in 2 hour traffic 5 days a week.

edited to add - idk how i forgot this important part lol my mom has worked remotely longer than i have. why did this person think it was a good idea to bring up MY remote job to my MOTHER, who is also a remote worker?!?!"
Exactly. These ppl understand computers and remote work. These ppl just don't respect these other posters  time and space.
"My boyfriend (34) is much the same. 10 years as an electrician in construction, an aircraft mechanic in the Navy before that, he really doesn't understand that despite being on the computer, I am in fact working. Probably confusing since there are times like these when I'm on a break, or extended break because I've completed my assigned work.

We're looking for him to get a WFH desk job as well. Nearly the exact same pay, far fewer hassles and far less effort than a physically demanding job."
"Depends, two relatively autonomuous teenagers? Sure you can work from home.

Two semi-autononomous older elementary children? Noisy, but doable depending on your work demands and your office setup. 

Two younger children, or if one of the children is younger? Nope."
i wfh 4 days a week and my 3 kids are in before and after care.
"I've been working from home for almost a year now and I've had my toddler with me the entire time. I started when he was 19 months. I did my full training and everything with him at home. Plus my 2 older kiddos that are in school have been home on their breaks and such. Plus taking care of the house, 2 dogs, and partly studying for my class. I have an amazing system and I work in my living room. Very few things are off limits to my little guy so he mostly plays while I work. He's learned that if my headset is on, he needs to be quiet. He is 2 though, so I have a healthy amount of snacks, toys that are more special, and various other distractors sitting on my desks for those times that he forgets. 

I am lucky to not have to be on the phone very often and the times that I am, I'm usually muted until I need to talk. I know I have one of the better wfh positions, but I wanted to shed light on how it is possible. 

Oh, and I'm one of the top performers in my department  time management is a VERY valuable skill"
"My family acted like this until they realized the hours I put in & I stayed with a relative during ""break"" & was holed up in their guest room 9+ hrs a day. After that, I dropped the rest of the family who still thought WFH wasn't a real job, but my cousin pushing MLMs was. I have a masters degree, tf do they think I do all day & still afford my student loan payment? Those same folks are big mad now that I have time & money to do fun things and don't make an effort to do it with them."
"Yup, my dad was a truck driver and my mom a nurse. They don't understand office jobs and WFH at all!"
"Yeah, 3 years on and my wife still doesn't completely get it. There are some days that Im WFH and there are no issues. Then there are other days where I end up having to help with the kids (either their breakfast, changing nappies etc) up until the time I should officially start work and beyond (I'm meant to start at 8:30, though I tend to start at 8). Then I'm expected to watch my son while she's dropping our daughter to daycare (if he doesn't also have daycare), put him to sleep when he needs to sleep and then gets grumpy if I don't finish at 5 on the dot. 

&#x200B;

This isn't a daily thing, but it happens enough that she should know better by now"
"Future positions will require wfh supervisor to be nominated - preferred selection may include grandmother, or other authorized adult who will keep you in line. 

If you miss your deadlines, authorized supervisor will be notified 


/s"
Haha - opposite of you; I got a puppy because I started working remotely! Never could've done it with an office job 
"Some people are just that way.  Half my family gives me grief on the holidays because I WFH, despite having a salaried position and graduate degree with a job that is 100% in front of a computer."
"Thank you. I hate when I see the word ""boomer""  used synonymously with clueless and bumbling.

I am 68, retired from my original career, and I now WFH doing I and R for a non-profit.

Most of my friends either still work, or are active retirees who nobody would call clueless."
"I am 100% pro remote work, but a hybrid model might suit you a little better. Maybe see if there are any in your area?"
"Park picnic shelter nice weather days
Your porch
Your deck
Sitting in your grass
Library
Church (lots of open rooms during the week)
Another WFH friends place
IKEA 
Coworking subscriptions may be as little as $199 a month and you can come and go
Ask local Reddit"
"Disagree--my company makes it clear that public wifi is a no-go. It's written into policy that all employees acknowledge, and when you are approved for remote work you list the address(es) from which you will work."
"Treat your WFH job exactly the same way you treated your office job.  Start at the same time everyday. End at the same time everyday.  Take breaks at the same time everyday.  Make sure your work area is separate from your home area.  Do extra communication with boss, co-workers and subordinates.  Don't take advantage of your job."
"Go outside once or twice a day and just stand outside and walk around, even if it's your yard, for like 20 minutes total a day. 10 min breaks. 

Gives you a new lease on life lol  

Also, over communicate. And I mean that in a positive way. Communicate instantly with things that you used to have to ""walk down the hall"" to talk about. People appreciate it and you'll appreciate it. 

Bonus side of WFH is on a slow day you can do whatever you want. Some days I choose to do extra work and get ahead of everything, making me look very proactive vs reactive. Some days I sit outside for 10 extra minutes or whatever. 


You'll love it, trust me. 

ALSO! Set up a dedicated workspace in your house that is NOT your bedroom and living room. You'll understand why if you choose not to do this lol"
"I dont do everything the same as when I was in the office. That's the benefit of working from home! I did realize after about 6 months of Covid wfh that slippers everyday all day was a bad idea. Other than that, I dont have any rules. But my employer doesn't care about clock time and things like that. She just wants the work done. I do the work. I can do it outside, upstairs on the treadmill, from my sons house while my grandbaby sleeps. Do the work. Take the opportunities work from home gives you."
"Put some effort into your at home office and your zoom call environment. Get a desk that's not your dining table, get a high quality chair, a mouse, multiple screens (if you need them). 

Make sure your zoom backdrop is good, I put up some wall paper and have good lighting to make it nice, no one wants to be on a call with someone in a dingy, dark, bedroom. 

Also, look toward the camera when you speak, don't just stare off into another monitor unless you have to."
Buy the biggest monitor you can (curved) and invest in a home office set up.
"Create a dedicated space for work and know where to draw a line from work and home.

The funny thing about WFH is that it can be easy to do work off hours because it is there. You need to respect the offices time, but remember to respect yours as well"
"I would recommend getting a good light and make sure you have a nice background. Considering your work remote with people across the whole organization, now your home office is the only way they will see you. Leaving a good, professional opinion is important."
"A lot of what I was going to say has already been said. I would as your employer what WFH stipends there are, if any. You're going to be paying for electricity that's for work. Internet for work. Phone for work. Etc. They should be helping you with some amount each month.

Work cell phone. Do they provide one? What's the personal phone use policy? I like to have a work phone so that I can step away if needed, but still access Teams, email, shared files, etc."
"I like to have a morning routine: wake up, work out, make breakfast, get ready for the day. I end up wearing athleisure most days but I still shower, change into fresh clothes, do my makeup, and let my routine punctuate the start and end of my work day. 

One perk is you can eat way healthier because you have time and access to your kitchen to prepare breakfast and lunch. 

Also, try to get up once every hour or two. I definitely gained weight my first year WFH because I was so stagnant. Get a walking pad or stand up and stretch or do a chore around the house (sweep, dishes, laundry). 

Have a designated working space, though I also like to mix things up and sit at the kitchen table or outside. I'm a clean freak and feel stressed when I'm around clutter. So I really had to communicate to my husband that now when he leaves the house a mess, he's leaving my office a mess. So he's gotten more mindful and helps keep things picked up.

Get a good chair that will support good posture.

And when you're done with work, close your computer and be done. It's easy to get caught up and let your evenings bleed into work.Take your dog for a walk, or go on a walk with your wife when she gets home. This gets you outside for fresh air, vitamin D, and a time to connect with your family and can mark the end of your work day and the start of your evening."
"Invest in a good home office set up. Get a very good chair first and foremost. I had three older 24 inch monitors and recently upgraded to 3 27 inch low eyestrain models and it made a huge difference in the way my eyes felt at the end of the day. I also got myself a three monitor arm setup to hold them.  Monitors were only about $200 each and the arm was also around 200 bucks. If you typically use a standing desk, definitely get one for home as well.  I know this sounds like a lot of money but the reduced cost of not going into the office will certainly make it all worth it.  Think about it, the current mileage reimbursement rate for the IRS is 65.5 cents. If you drive 20 miles each way to work that's $26.20 each day you're not spending commuting."
Yeah I've noticed that about this sub too. I think it comes from the idea that people enjoying themselves at home will ruin it for everyone with RTO mandates but it still just comes off as very strange. Some people will still get called back in person so if they don't let themselves enjoy WFH while it lasts then what's the point
I finally bought fuzzy socks with grippy bottoms - not slippery on my hardwood floors but also not slippers. I call them my work socks! Silliest best WFH choice I've made.
"Not ""stuck"", but absolutely have told my boss I wouldn't be in the job without remote work and that if the agency every reversed policy, I'm bouncing.

Sounds like, even though it is remote, you're still possibly forced into ""in office"" mentality (attendance tracking, excessive meetings, etc.)?"
I love WFH but I'm not thrilled with my current job anymore. I like the benefits but the job itself can be both stressful or boring at times. If  I wasn't working from home I would have looked for another job by now.
Opposite. I had a really easy WFH job that wasn't so hard but I was there 3 years and they never gave any raises and I needed more money so I quit. Now I'm in an office and they pay me more money but I'm not at home
"Yea. I'm there now. Tried to move up or over and got told I don't have the confidence to move over and that I don't have enough management practice to qualify for the management training program that's supposed to help get into people management.

Anyway, I'm feeling pretty burned out and unmotivated after that whole ordeal so I'm ready to just enjoy WFH. I get good customer feedback, I surpass all my goals, I pass compliance, I help my team mates on every team I'm on and. I used to be very active in meetings (camera on and shit, even though it's not required). I'm just doing enough to keep my job now and get a good bonus."
"I'm heavily under paid for what I do, but thanks to WFH I was able to automate and reduce my work load. Now I do about 1 hour of work a day.

So now im stuck in a situation where I could jump ship and double my pay, but doing so would multiply my work by at least 4 times"
"It's how I feel now. Working from home is great, I haven't had a commute since March 2019. But my actual job has become full of stress and anxiety and cringe. Maybe not every single day but probably still every week, definitely every sprint or month.

I have a house now and I spent 5-6 years doing what was supposed to take maybe a year and a half - that is, had a house, decided I wanted to move to another state, moved to another state, spent way too long renting, finally bought a house again. So in a sense it's almost like I'm still piecing things back together from my 2018-2019 life.

This job feels like golden handcuffs now. Income is great as long as no one notices and decides I cost too much. Company got acquired by a foreign/international company in late 2022, been watching layoffs since mid 2023, meanwhile having survived the layoffs I'm stuck in this awkward position between my consulting company and my client. Consulting company is foreign now, probably not going to improve my QOL any further. Client is pushing crazy deadlines and hiring away my coworkers, but there is so much politics between departments not to mention late nights/weekends that they do, I don't want them trying to hire me away.

Feeling stuck because I don't think I can get the same pay and benefits and strictly WFH setup, now that I'm trying to have the dust settle from my own relocations and living situation."
"Hot take: the autonomy provided by a WFH situation trumps everything, unless you are just starting your career or have no immediate family.  If you're not in one of the aforementioned situations and you're still bored or unfulfilled, you're not spending enough time with your family or you need more interesting hobbies. Sure, there are exceptions (like if you truly hate your job with the fire of a thousand suns, or a large raise will significantly increase your quality of life) but for the majority of us who deal with general career malaise, time and autonomy used well is the answer."
"I'm in a different boat. Like my job not loving WFH, company has no office. AND I moved to a tiny rural town so no jobs around making similar money or doing interesting work. Ugh"
"I feel trapped. I HATED my last job. Had a horrible boss, terrible coworkers so much drama. I'm a nurse and I unbelievably have a wfh job with no patient contact. I review patient charts. I've been doing it since Covid. 3 years this week working from home. I can go in if I want to a shared office that's a literal closet with no windows. I'd have to pay to park. Drive down I-95 and walk a mile to get inside to said office. But I feel like I'd be STUPID to leave. I can do what I want; when I want as long as I get my work done. I don't have any set hours. I go on all my kids field trips, school events, parties, etc. I always get the vacation days I want. Never have to work a holiday. Literally the best retirement job I could ever ask for in my 40s. But it sure does get lonely...."
Yes. Been at a job I hate for 2.5 years because of wfh benefits. I cry. And then I get over it. Cause I think I'd off myself if I had to to sit in an office for 40 hours a week again 
So different line of work. I'm a clinical mental health therapist with crisis and trauma specialty. I landed this crisline job that's 3rd shift WFH. I want to get back out and do in person therapy again but no one can match my current pay.  I can't take a pay cut and take on the extra cost of going to an office. So I'm stuck in a job that pays me very well to use a fraction of my skill set.  And no one wants to pay me the salary it would take to go back to the high risk crisis response work I did before.
"Remote jobs definitely exist in HR. All companies have HR, and remote first companies seem to often invest in L&D and employee experience tools that might even make for more robust HR departments. I work in L&D, with some HR experience prior (generalist and EE before education/training focus) and remote postings aren't what they were in 2021/2 but I'm seeing quite a few still. I check EE and HRBP as well as HR Analyst and other HR roles as well as L&D. Stuff is out there. However, a lot more are fairly senior or want robust skill sets, so it may depend where you are in your career, but that's a factor of the competition in the market. 

But the ""around you"" part is confusing--actually remote jobs shouldn't be areas dependent. My area isn't the greatest but that's part of why remote work is awesome. 

If you're early career, many jobs suck (HR particularly is one of those fields where entry level jobs are harder and more thankless) so being WFH and not liking your job is definitely better than in office! Build experience so you're more competitive to move on, if needed and that's the case. 

If not, fix up that resume and always be looking. I liked my job, but just got a new one because I apply to interesting things periodically and a great opportunity arose. If I'm not moving up constantly, I'm moving on. And even if I am, I'm keeping my job hunting going to stay sharp, since it's so easy to do so with remote work. "
"Find another job that's remote. Plenty of companies out there embracing WFH. You'll only ever see return to office articles online though, which tends to make people think remote work is going away forever."
"I don't love my job, per se, but.... I WFH about 80% and the other days are me doing site visits. It's very cushy in a field where such comfort is exceedingly rare. I am well paid. There are not many other options out there for me and certainly very few with this combo of pay and perks. 

If you truly hate it, then absolutely quit or start looking but I'd ask you to consider the circumstances of the job as much as anything else. Your job will never love you back, so what would be the alternatives?"
"I've been WFH since Covid, and it would take a lot to get me to go into an office.  And my office was like a Google one, with catered lunches everyday, beer in the fridge, ping pong tables, fun people, all that good stuff"
"Yup I hate my job a little more every day, like I've gotten last really tolerating it and I'm starting to not care at all about the work I'm putting out (I am but I'm not). Been trying to find a better job for a year but have come up with nothing. But for safety concerns (sickness and violence) id rather stay WFH than go back on person somewhere."
"Yes I don't enjoy my job at all but it's super laid back WFH. Most days I only work 10am-2/3pm. So while I'm miserable, I'm only miserable a few hours a day (on FT pay lol)"
">and my employer made a very special exception for me

...is that what they told you?

There's no reason not to look for another job. Or to hang around in multiple HR forums talking about WFH opportunities.

Or... would you feel OK with switching from HR to something vaguely related?"
"Fortunately, I love work from home and love my job. Win-win."
"I never was thrilled with my job, but the pay was good. Went to WFH which was good, but the job is sucking away my will to live, so to speak. Can't find another WFH job, or even an in office job that pays like this. I am stuck here forever. 
If you have to take a small step backwards to move 2 steps ahead it might be worth it."
"My WFH role, they started me at 15 an hour in 2021. In 2023 they were still paying me 15 an hour after 2.5 years, I never got raises. My new job pays me $22 an hour and I have to drive in an office. I prefer working from home but I couldn't live on $15 anymore"
"Yes, no, sorta.

&#x200B;

I've developed a bunch of tools and systems so that work that previously would have taken hours now takes minutes. New tasks come my way occasionally, and I need to figure out how to fit them into my systems, and when that doesn't work, update my systems so they do.

I'm not learning new skills per se, but I am refining the ones I already have. It wouldn't be hard for me to find another job in my field, and I don't see that changing in the future.

&#x200B;

The network aspect is more dicy. Because I WFH, and because everyone in my department does too, I have very little contact with other people in my company. The contact I do have is all with people who are way higher than me in the hierarchy, which is its own set of issues.

&#x200B;

I know that staying where I'm at is causing me to miss opportunities, and is almost certainly harming my long-term prospects. On the other hand, I'm happy where I am right now. I go out once a week with friends, I'm going to a concert soon, and I just spend an embarrassing amount of money on a phone game.

In 10 years I might regret this, but for now I think I'm good."
"Lonely...went I worked from an office, I went there to work, not socialize or treat it like high school.

WFH has made my life 100% easier and I can spend more time with my family."
"It's not that I don't think these people exist.  One of my good friends was working from home after COVID and could still be WFH, but voluntarily went back to the office because he just didn't like being distracted.  So these people do exist.  I just think that it's terrible that they never tell the other story of the person that started WFH and saved a lot of money, sparked their relationship with their partner, took their relationship with their children to a new level, lost weight, etc.    


And quite frankly this is a person that wants to go back to the office to be with co-workers (many of whom don't want to reciprocate that relationship) instead of being with family and friends....it speaks volumes of how messed up their life is."
There is a big PR push just to make it look like WTF or remote work is bad for your health. It's nonsense.
"There are plenty of in office jobs, take one of those. Let us have our WFH, and stop pushing your narrative."
"I love working remotely mostly and going onsite once a week on Mondays. I don't have to go onsite at all, but find in my particular job, I get a lot done quicker being face to face with my colleagues and it sets me up for the weeks. Everyone is different and has different jobs and preferences."
Businesses are tired of wasting rent money on office space they can't fill but are stuck in 10 or 20 year leases because they have so many remote workers. This is propaganda to bring workers back
"So you're willing to give up a personal relationship in order to be in an office ? No offense but she looks like an up and coming model they picked up the street in NYC, that picture may not even be her but she looks like the young people who truly enjoy working remotely. 

Many of the generation are fools and will follow suit. We like to say we have freedom but we are all sheep of the corporate enterprise in America. We are scared to speak up because we may loose our income. 

America is great but it has some really sucky parts and unwritten rules "
"I work for a remote first company with offices. Our policy is come in when you want, work remote when you want. 

I'm a good distance from our office so I don't go in, I have people nearby who voluntarily go in 2-3 days a week to be social with their coworkers.  

Personally I feel somewhat lonely / isolated with remote work but it's not enough I want to go back to an office based role. I can see how people who are a lot more social than me would find it difficult. 

As a manager I feel like meetings online can be productive but it's also annoying when everyone turns up late to the zoom call, someone has a bad connection, people talk over each other on a call, people have cameras off and don't join in the conversation etc.  I'd never force people back to the office but I can understand why some leadership struggle with remote work. 

I think the best thing for return to office is get smaller offices or Co working space and let teams meet when they feel the need to meet, and let them be remote when there's no desire to be in the office."
onlyfans is wfh
"I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this, but I believe there is some merit in that paradigm. I've WFH for nearly a decade ... way before the pandemic.  I'm an introverted extrovert ... I crave human interaction, but need my isolation periods in order to function successfully. 

I've never been a social butterfly at work. I go there to earn a paycheck and all the drama of mixing with work folks socially is just next level awful.  So that's not what drives my opinion.  I've been with my company for more than decade and I do have friendships there so it is nice to be able to see them without having to schedule and reschedule due to life outside of work.   
 I'm also old and crotchety so I don't have much of a social life these days outside of my family. They tell me that will get better as the last of the kids get older and more independent.  I'm still waiting lol.

I think being a veteran WFH person, the pandemic added a whole other level of isolation that just wasn't felt pre-pandemic.  Kids were having to do school at home. Other family members were out of work or also WFH and, being new to the dynamic, were awful to be around constantly.  No one was going out for dates or dinners with friends. Everyone was piled on top of one another for hours and days and months on end.  It was chaos! When I was promoted at work after restrictions were lifted and was told the position was hybrid and required one day a week in office, honestly, I welcomed the change of scenery and distraction from what WFH life had been like for the 2 years prior.  

Now that life is ""back to normal"", I still prefer to WFH and don't think I could do in office more than one or two days a week.  I still feel like I'm way more productive at home and you just can't beat the work life balance it brings."
"It's nice to know the mods around here are inconsistent in their application of moderation. 

Not sure how these articles actually help anyone who is wanting to, or currently WFH because there's no content providing help, just remorse."
"The height of annoyance (so far) to me from the anti WFH crowd is, a car manufacturer has a commercial running on college football games (ESPN etc) showing young professionals who'd just received a mythical ""email"" and are like, rushing around to get to their cars and saying, on the iPhone to their colleagues, ""I'll be there in 30 minutes!"". It's a play to those gen-z'ers who're proportedly getting called to RTO. It's the stupidest car commercial I've seen and wouldn 't shock if that demographic they're trying to sell to shuns their vehicles and buys fewer of them."
"I agree it probably is a targeted story with an angle, but I really do know people who don't like working at home.  Not the majority of WFH folks, but they do exist."
"Big company here.

I have had many employees start with WFH during pandemic, who were resistant to coming into the office.

Once they started coming in one day a week, they started feeling the camaraderie, seeing the opportunities to learn and progress that occur in the corridors and non-planned meets, and just enjoying the working directly with people that they extend to 2, 3 and more days per week.

Many are now full time and would rarely go back (except during storms, appointments, etc).

There are some roles that can be effective from home, and they often have limited paths anyways, but for most others the various opportunities are learned in the day to day activity on site.

One of my favorite discussions with employees is ""look around, and tell me whose job you would want.. and I'll help you get there.""  But if you only see the same 3 or 4 zoom squares in your work, you don't see those opportunities."
It's getting harder and harder to get a wfh job
"When my company announced permanent WFH, I did have two people pretty much quit because they wanted to go to the office. So, they quit to find another office job. 

This was like less than 1% of my staff. So, does it happen? Yup. But not enough to drive EVERYONE back to the office."
"Just because WFH works for you, doesn't mean it works for everyone. My preference is for hybrid as I like the office interaction, but I wouldn't want to go back more than 1-2 days a week."
"See, I have the opposite. In the office, nothing but yammering and distractions. WFH is total peace and focus. I'm much more productive and efficient. Not that it matters because they're going to push RTO because that's the capitalism handbook. Gotta get people spending money. Joke is on them because I won't be spending on anything but gas. That alone is ridiculous, we all know the issues with that.

And the US has once again proven we will never again be a progressive country unless we get the rich people out of government."
I've gained a bunch of weight wfh. I lost my routines and struggling to get it together but I love wfh.  I wouldn't go back if I had a choice.  Just need to not be lazy and snacking all the time
"I am as far up in my company as I can go without being a board member. I do not want nor need that promotion and if the company felt that my position required in person interaction they had the opportunity to find someone to fill it 2 years ago when I told them I was relocating and would either be WFH or resigning. Obviously they chose to work with my change of venue. 

I realize that I am not the norm in that I already did the in-person, climb the promotion ladder thing for this company for well over a decade. We are also a company that has off-site managed other locations for a long time so me sitting at a desk in location 2 while running location 2 and 3 isn't necessary. I can do my job from anywhere, I prefer to do it where I have peace and quiet and am not constantly interrupted with general office chatter."
You realize you are on wfh? Pushing some weird ass take about benefits of commuting so that you can have mindless chit chat? Nothing stops you from hitting people on teams and slack.
"Same. I worked hybrid starting in 2016.

COVID WFH was brutal. As soon as they asked us to come back to the office I went in every Tuesday/Thursday. But then 9 months later they shut down the office because no one was showing up. Then I worked from the public library a day or two a week. That helps. But I'm actively looking for a job that has at least remote.

I enjoyed going to the office even though it was 90% empty. I like that it have new separation between work and home and distraction-free work."
I know I am on r/WFH and I actually build software products that support WFH. I'm just pointing out that not everyone is a fully dedicated WFH person.
"Because I don't like it that much. It has its utility and value for collaboration and socials, but not to the extent of 5 days a week being beneficial. WFH is great for productivity, but suffers from incomplete communications.

Take body language as an example, and the percentage of remote meetings held without video.... Even with video you only get chest and above at most. You miss a lot of information that can be gained from body language in face to face interactions.

It seems to be an impossible perspective to include in WFH solutions.  I've tried and we have not found a workable solution yet."
"My job force us in 3 days a week with no option to remote work. Seems all or nothing, unilateral dictatorship to me."
How does a nurse work from home?
"This is a sub about people who work from home, it does not say people have to be 100% remote. It is specified in the rules that this sub is not for RTO rants. Also, I am not vegetarian but love going on vegetarian subs for recipe ideas. Not all meals need to include meat. Reading your comments here you clearly have an all or nothing mindset."
"How guaranteed is the WFH? A lot of companies are clawing back those rights so if you lose the benefit AND the pay it's certainly not worth it. Do you think that those 3 days a week extra at home are really worth 13k a year? 

Additionally, if you have capped out at the top of the scale coming onboard what does that look like in 3 years? 5 years? Do you have a growth plan or income growth plan at this company or are you hoping to coast indefinitely?"
"""I'm a bit stuck here because $13,000 is a really big amount!  
Edit: Current is 118k and new would be 105k.""

I think you answered your own question. The math will come out the roughly the same depending on your cost of living, gas, eating out when your are at the office, etc. And when you ""loathe"" your company, this WFH job should look like a dream, why do you doubt it aside from the $13K?"
"13k is like $700/month after taxes. Save over 1 hour a day driving, sleep in more, have more energy and autonomy over your schedule before/after work, probably even better work culture since all employees are WFH. You'd be nuts not to accept."
"Good lord, so many of you WFH people are so strangely credulous. 

100x ""Yes! Definitely take it!""

Meanwhile, I read a dozen stories a week in various subs of people getting bait and switched on remote work - this is like a standard employer tactic now. 

If that happens here, OP's is going to hate life in a way that would cause me personally to want to go postal. 

I'm not saying don't take it - but how are so many of you so glossy-eyed, automatically trusting of employers? It's fucking scary."
"My job is already remote, and if you asked me if I'd go to in-office for $13K/year more, I'd laugh in your face. That would be barely a 10% raise for me. Not worth it, not by a long shot. If another employer was trying to lure me away, they'd need to offer a LOT more to get me to give up remote work, especially if I were to need to commute in to the metro center here, which is only 15 miles away but during rush hour can be a 45-minute drive on the best of days, closer to 90 minutes when you hit it wrong."
Absolutely go with the WFH job. You'll definitely save move than that WFH. You should get the new company to put something about 100% WFH in your offer/contract.
"In my position right now? No. I WFH four days a week and enjoy my work, manager is really cool, team is great. In your position? Yes, I would. Hopefully your bonus can make up for the lower salary."
"So just some rough numbers. You currently spend almost 7 hours a week driving. Essentially, close to the equivalent of a workday.

I'm also guessing you spend about eight hours at the office. But at least an hour or two of that time is probably kind of wasted time. Let's say that generously you work six hours after taking some time off for lunch, and other time wasters that are part of being at the office.

So you are away from home for almost 48 hours. But you really only have to do 30 hours of actual work.

In the work from home position, the commute is off the table. And those times when time is being wasted? That's when you can be throwing in a load of laundry. Or making a sandwich for lunch. Or unloading the dishwasher while listening to somebody babble on during a meeting.

You put in your 30 hours of actual work, and the rest of your time as yours.

Which one sounds better to you? 30 hours of work for $2000 a week? Or 48 hours of work for $2250 a week?  Oh, and gas plus vehicle maintenance and where in tear Hass to cost you $100 a week or more, unless you were driving an electric vehicle or a really efficient hybrid. So the net difference is now down to under $150 a week. Are you willing to give the company 18 additional hours of your time for $150?

This is a no-brainer to me. You say you hate your current company. You'll barely even notice the difference in pay. Make the move."
"the ability to work fully remote is easily worth 30-50k        (or... in my mind,  i'm not taking an in office job  without that kinda pay bump)

or... think of it like.  118k  current salary.   at  35 in 45 home.      prob at least an hour to get ready to leave.  hour getting home to decompress  lets just be generous and say 3 extra hours a day.    means in a 260 work day year at 11 hrs per day.  you're at   $41 per hour.

at  105k    same 260 work day year.   at a flat 8 hrs   (and lets be real.  we all know working from home isn't  flat 8hrs of your day gone,  tons of opportunity to do house chores,  cook/meal prepare,  laundry,  relax.   do small errands. shit in peace,   flexibility to maybe handle appointments.       ....but.   260 x 8 is 2080    105k.   is 50 an hr.

this doesn't even factor in...   gas, wear/tear on a vehicle...  expense of food while going to the office.   laundry costs of work clothes.  expense of work clothes.   other misc expenses...  of i dunno.

It's not great to take a job for less.   but.   WFH   can not be underestimated the savings, and quality of life boost.

hell...  affords you opportunity to work on side projects   if the loss of income is truly an issue."
Lol at everyone saying to do it. Don't do it. Continue looking for a role that pays the same or more and work from home. There are plenty of jobs. Try negotiating as well
Probably not unless you need the remote for childcare etc. you also already get some WFH with your current job.
"Wow I was kind of the exact same position a couple months ago. I decided on the pay cut which was about 10k and so far such a great decision. Working from home has been really nice and just way less stress than commuting all the time. It also helps that the company is dope and I was able to move somewhere and pay less rent. 

At the end of the day if you really value work from home and think the company is good then I would do it. Oh yeah I was also making almost the same salary as you too. The smaller paychecks do sting but the amount of time I save more than makes up for it."
"Does current employer subsidize parking or any other costs?

What else is eliminated from the budget if you WFH.  Lunches out?

13k/12=$1084 decreased monthly wages divided by 21 working days each month is about $52.00 pay reduction each workday.  I think you will save that much if not more."
"Absolutely. I want to do WFH starting in the next 3-5 years, and I'm willing to take up to a $20k salary cut off of what I currently make to do that."
"Nope. I guarantee you I do not spend $13,000 on gas in one year. I'd keep my regular job.

Edit: oop I never learned to read and I'm just seeing your salary edit. Yes, take the WFH job stat!!!!"
Next year you'll get a customary increase and will have been at a job you don't despise and enjoying WFH. Jump ship.
"As others have mentioned, I would take the job if you can still pay your bills with the pay cut, but absolutely get the WFH spelled out in the contract.  If you find that the job isn't to your liking for whatever reason, you can always start the job hunt again. Which will be much easier if you're already WFH.

I'm 100% remote and love it!  It also gives me a lot of flexibility for travel, because I can do my job anywhere that has sufficient Wi-Fi.  Something to consider.

Good luck!"
"How expensive is the area you live?  Avoiding the commute and new car could certainly lessen the blow of the decrease.  I'd go for it.  Working remotely has been great for my physical and mental health, personally.

I'm also probably a bit detached as our HHI is  \~$400k in a reasonably priced metro with no state tax. I'd take a 50% paycut to keep my remote option FWIW."
YES. There is no replacement for the freedom of remote work. We earn money for freedom but getting it back 40 hours a week is worth it for a pay cut.
So basically you're taking home about $700/mo less to work from home. You could probably freelance in the time you're not commuting and make it hat up
"HELL YES.

Some benefits $$ cannot buy. You said it yourself, you're miserable at $113k. But you could be happy at $105k.

I (25f) work from home for a PE firm and it's amazing! I've had the chance to create healthy routines for myself (workout out 3-4/wk, cooking almost every meal, etc) that I couldn't imagine not being able to do going into the office. And when I have kids, i can still sustain my inbox level AND be with my children when they're small... probably could even afford a nanny during the day. Life is to be LIVED.. so give yourself a chance to live a little more.

You could turn those 2-3 day vacations into 7-10 day vacations and work remotely while you're away. You could have more time with your kids. You could learn a new skill/hobby. You could workout more. You could learn to cook more. Hell, you can do whatever you want while balancing work.

Do it!"
"Looking at that type of situation right now. WFH is very appealing because that way I can visit family for extended periods if necessary (like a week on either end of a one week vacation). Time is short and family is worth more than $13k, especially when my salary range gets me acceptably past the ""enough income to avoid unpleasant things"" boundary."
I got a 5.3% pay raise to work from home.
"The first question that comes to mind is can they revoke the work from home status? Unfortunately most employers aren't willing to say a job is 100% guaranteed remote. If that's the case I wouldn't take it because what if you get stuck commuting again in a year or 2? Now the savings of not commuting not only don't exist but you're potentially taking home less money.

If they can put it in writing that it's permanently remote, I would strongly consider it. Otherwise maybe get them to put in writing that they'll boost you 10-15k if they call you back in, even to a hybrid setup."
I took a pay cut from 75k to 50k to wfh
"Absolutely worth that pay cut! The cost of RTO is not a percentage of pay like taxes, it would be the same if you made 10k or 100k a year, the lower your wage, the worse RTO is. We got the RTO order earlier this year so i did a 6-mo survey in expenses. Between food, gas, wear & tear of my vehicle I spend an extra $580/mo going into the office 3 days a week! That's not including the hour of my time spent on the commute. That's roughly $7000/yr loss and rising, thanks to inflation, just to go into the office. Double that if i want to consider the cost of commute time. Without any consideration of how awesome WFH is compared to office life RTO costs more than $14k a year for me"
"I'm job hunting right now and after 3+ years of remote work, I'd gladly take something $13k less if it was WFH.

I'd also try to figure out exactly how much that commute time is worth. The salary they're offering is $105k, at the average # of hours (2080, 52 weeks @ 40 hrs), the new job is offering you $50.48 an hour. 

For your current position, if you add in the commute time, you get around 2426 hours. That makes your hourly rate $48.64. Also, note how much you could get done with an extra 300+ hours in your year!

If you break it down by hours of your time (I would), you'd really be getting paid more at the new job, not even including car expenses. As long as you can swing it financially, I think it's 100% worth it"
"Look at your budget, can you afford what seems to be about $700-900 loss after taxes per month? Calculate what you save on gas as well, i drove longer but spent $280 per month or $3,360 a year for example, lunch costs, car repair/maintenance in the last year/estimated for the next, even clothing, shoes etc

The 'loss' is probably a lot less than 13k. Mines was probably like 5k a year difference.

Personally, i would, i love work from home. The best savings are time and energy."
"In 2016, when I finally got out of my career's version of [Initech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space), I did have to take a similar cut ($132k down to $120k).  It wasn't WFH, but that came just 8 months later, when my new employer had a sudden layoff.

The very next job WAS fully remote work, and I quickly made up the missing $12k during the next year, and the job market has been very generous to me in all the years since.   (software developer since 1989, devops engineer since 2017)

GET OUT NOW!  Life is too short to be held back."
"Yes. I went wfh and hubby is wfh with a lot of travel. Our big suv broke down and we didn't replace it. The working cat is a sedan big enough for just us.  We rent a larger car when needed and take Ubers / bus if someone else needs a car which is not often. Saves $$$$$$$$$$. 

Not to mention all the other benefits"
Definitely do it. The quality of life improvement alone is fair tradeoff. BUT be sure to understand the details of the contract re: how long is wfh guaranteed? Does it need to be renegotiated regularly?
"If you factor your commute time into your current hourly pay (I'm assuming you work 40 hours a week at both jobs), you would make approximately 1 dollar less per hour at the new job. (you spend approx. 208 hours a year commuting, so 118000/2288 vs 105000/2080)

I'm going to guess based on your numbers, your commute is probably somewhere in the range of 15-20 miles? That's 4500-6000 miles a year, so that means one extra oil change every year. Plus gas, that's at least a gallon a day in most vehicles, which would be 156 gallons of gas, at the current national average that's almost $600/year, or upwards of $1200+ if you drive something not very fuel efficient and live somewhere where gas is significantly more than $3.61 a gallon. It's also 1 more set of tires every 10 years, and your brakes will need to be done one more time every 5-10 years. (This is to say that in a decade, you will buy one less set of tires and have your brakes done 1 or 2 less times without your commute than with it) - plus all the other incidentals on the car.

You might be able to get your insurance lowered if you demonstrate that you're driving a lot less, too.

Were I in your shoes, I would absolutely take the pay cut to WFH. You'll save 4 hours a week and hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on your vehicle by eliminating the commute.

Especially since you'll likely spend less on food, too."
"I've worked from home for over 12 years. I will never go back into an office. You need to think of the after-tax impact, not fixate on the 13k. The change to your actual paycheck may be less than $300 per paycheck (Assuming 8k after taxes, but you can run those numbers yourself.) For that:

* You save the aggravation of the commute, and get back an hour of your time *each day*.
* You save the time in the morning you spend to get dressed and ready for work.
* You save money on gas and vehicle maintenance. Your car will last much longer.
* You save money on dress clothes. (I wear comfortable shorts and a polo all day.)
* You can get small chores done around the house in between calls, instead of spending your free time doing chores all day.
* You can eat healthier, and don't need to spend money going out to lunch.
* You can exercise in between calls. I often take meetings on a treadmill, or do a dumbbell workout on a call where I just have to listen.
* You can organize your workspace the way you like (huge productivity boost for me.)
* If money is a huge issue and your workload is light, you can get a second WFH job. Check out r/overemployed to see how others are doing this.

Working from home is a complete lifestyle change, as many people discovered during the pandemic. I would jump on this job, especially as your sound miserable in your current role."
Can you get a guarantee re how long the WFH runs for?
I would take the WFH job
">My current company is a 35 minute drive in and a 45 min drive home. I work from home two days a week.

If I had to go to our office my commute would be similar, and I estimate it would cost me (gas vehicle maintenance, clothes, incidentals)  $10k yr + add 10 hours a week to my work schedule.  Using that measure, you're only making $3k less, but you also get that commute time back and that's gotta be worth more than $3k for the year."
"I had to make a similar decision recently when I decided a 15% paycut to do the exact same job from the west coast to the Midwest. Nothing in my role has changed, but the 15% took a lot from my family still. However, I'm very comfortable wfh, and I can enjoy watching my kids grow up, letting my dog out to play whenever I want to, etc. The office life sucked the life out of me daily and now I have my life back"
All day every day. WFH is the best.
I currently WFH and I wouldn't take a job that paid twice as much if I had to commute 40 minutes.
"WFH saved me:

- About $50/week in food (* 48 weeks = 2400)
- About 20,000 miles (555 gallons of fuel in my car), so $1800 at 3.25 a gallon
- Wild guess $500 in maintenance (brakes and tires mostly)
- I've kept my paid off car 2 years longer than expected, so call it $2K a year accounting for payments and residual value.
- $400? In clothes and shoes. I have no idea- I'm married so clothes just show up and I don't know what they cost
- $500ish on takeout dinners I would have bought because I was getting home late

So $7600 roughly. That comes out of my take home pay so probably $9K in salary to make that. 

So in your case I'd be down $4K salary but I'd get back about 450 hours a year (driving and ironing clothes) at a cost to me of $8.88 per hour salary or 7.10 an hour after taxes. More if you consider whatever I'd make if I invested that money.

Worth it to me but you have to do your own math and figure in your lifestyle choices."
"For me - the answer is 100% yes, because I took a significant pay cut to take my current WFH job. No regrets. I love my current job. I haven't done the math but I no longer spend time/money on a 1.5 hours of commute, I hardly put any miles on my car, I don't buy dress clothes, I don't spend as much for lunch every day etc. I also do house work on my breaks because it keeps me active. This results in a clean house so I can enjoy the weekend. It's also nice to take a nap or walk the dog whenever I want. I will never work in an office again."
"""I loathe my current company and that's why I am looking for a new job.""

That alone, especially in your pay band, would be enough. But WFH is great, no commute is worth a ton."
"Approaching this as a financial decision is just one aspect of the WFH question. Think critically about the aspects of your life / work-life that will change for better and maybe worse:
- You'll be on your own schedule
- You'll be responsible for high quality work output without having the same communication constructs in an office (e.g., asking Steve his opinion who points you Anna who you previously didn't know and she's a wealth of institutional knowledge on XYZ)
- You'll have all the distractions and none of the social / ethical guardrails (in my case it's video games and messing around in the garden)
- You'll need to stock the fridge more 
- You'll have more time to spend with friends / family
- You won't really make work relationships 

I wouldn't trade my WFH under most circumstances, but I know plenty of people at my office that choose to go in."
"Do it.  When my company started WFH during Covid, I saved 2hrs a day in traffic, and $400ish in fuel.  Plus the peace of mind of being at home, not having to rush around in the morning, etc is worth the paycut."
"I'd probably take the new job, but make sure two things: 

1. still try to negotiate. If the salary can't move, what can they do for sign on or maybe more PTO to help make up the difference. They don't need to know you are fine with the offer 

2. The wfh part is in your contract and they pay for your internet and any other requirements"
With the extra 13k over years you'll be much closer to retirement and permanent wfh.  This would be an incredibly dumb move and you should be stronger in negotiations.  Anything involving giving back money is a non-starter.
"Personally, I wouldn't. A 45 minute drive for me is about 12 miles. My car is about 26mpg so that would cost all of one gallon a day for gas. At the average $3.22 per gallon to go in 3 days a week for 52 weeks that's $500 in gas per year to and from work. So sure you'll be saving money on gas, but not nead enough. Then there's lunches, alright you'll save a little money there if you are currently getting takeout lunches daily and switch to homemade, but you'll still need groceries and then also time and effort to make the lunch. That also won't save you near 13k.

With how often people post on this sub that their job swore up down and backwards that they'll never go back to the office just to demand exactly that a month later, I wouldn't trust it enough to take any form of pay cut. 

But if you hate your job, want to work from home, can afford to miss out on 13k a year, and think you may be able to climb up quickly in the new company, go for it."
"Well, yes. Wfh is no work at all so you can have that and then have a real job. Double the pay double the joy"
Yes working remotely is worth living at the poverty line for lmao 
"I would not quit my main job until the wfh job is secured and you like working for them . After all it is work from home , so you might be able to get away still keeping your day job ."
"You can save that 13k just from the commute/not eating out. But make sure they're actually WFH and that's not going to change anytime soon.

$7800 cut after ~30% taxes, that's $650 a month you'd be missing. How much do you spend on eating out and gas? Are there any perks at the new job you can take advantage of? That could also reduce your costs.

Edit: corrected percentage"
Hell no.  What you also are not factoring in is remote workers generally get lower bonuses less pay raises and less promotions.  Out of sight out of mind.
"$13k can easily be made up by cutting back and adding a side hustle. My wife and I currently WFH and have a great breakfast and lunch at a fraction of the cost of eating out. Plus our pets get home cooked meals and get more exercise as we walk the dogs as lunch and play with the cats through out the day. 

The devil you don't know is the biggest unknown. What does Glassdoor say about the new place?"
Already WFH but I wouldn't RTO for an extra 13K
"100% would take it just for the fact that your current job makes you miserable. Add in wfh and it's a definite super yes lol.  Also calculate the 401k matching - is it more than your current position? When you add that in and look at total compensation, it might be the same. What about vacation days? Can you negotiate some additional days off?  I usually try to calculate the ""value"" of paid holidays and vacation days because sometimes that extra week of vacation is absolutely worth a wage cut"
"My first instinct is to say no. It's a big cut just to work from home. If it was a few thousand then perhaps. 

That being said, you need to look at the total compensation package. Add up all the benefits and see how it compares to your current salary and benefits package. If it is close, then perhaps it's worth it."
Make sure you get the wfh portion in writing as part of the hire contract. But not having a commute? Well worth the pay hit
"I literally did this last year. I think my but was actually quite a bit more, but the new company has WAY better benefits. 

How much is your time worth? At least $50/hour at your lower rate. How much time will you spend driving to work, getting ready, and getting un-ready when you get home? On the short end we'll call it thirty minutes in the morning and thirty in the evening (although it's likely longer). That's five hours a week 50 weeks a year (we'll say between holidays and vacations it off sets two weeks). 250 hours*$50= $12,500. That's before car maintenance, gas, compensation for the stress of driving during rush hour, the 'but I could do this job at home' tax, clothing upkeep, extra water for the showers you'd skip at home because you've become nose blind to your WFH scent, and everything else you'd be gaining from WFH. That's the rate that the new job would be paying you for the time you're spending being unproductive for your current role. If you value your time as much as this company then you should take the position. If you value your time more than that then the new company is giving you an even bigger raise, but part of the compensation is paid in hours worth $xx each. If the benefits are better than where you are now, jump on it! 

Hour commute = $50
Gas per month = $400
Pooping in your own restroom = Priceless"
"If you're comfortable with the cut, I would probably consider it.

If you can maintain your current quality of life then I think that 13k cut is worth it. 

For me working remote has provided the opportunity to pick up my kids from school everyday. I don't miss out on any school functions as well. I used to work four, ten hour days and between traffic I was never home till after 6:00PM. 

The occasional trip downtown reminds me everytime why I will never leave remote work.

Remote work saves me over 300 hours a year in commuting time.  I've probably save at least $1,000 in fuel and wear and tear on my car."
I WFH and I would not take a $13k pay bump to go back into the office.
"100% take the WFH job. Assuming you have the discipline/home environment to thrive when working from home the amount of time you will get back over the course of the year will more then make up for the $13k loss. 

&#x200B;

I don't understand how people who have the option and have tasted the benefits of WFH will ever go back in office. For me the drive to work, lunch at work and drive back is \~2.5 hours per day spent unpaid because of work.  That's 12.5 hours per week , 612 hours per year (removed some weeks for pto). That's 15 additional weeks worth of my time PER YEAR that is getting sucked up by travel and unpaid lunch at a job for no reason.

&#x200B;

I will have to get a ridiculous offer to go back hybrid, and I don't believe a position/salary exists that I qualify for that will get me in 5 days a week anymore."
"I saved so much money going back to remote work after 4 years of on-site client work. 

I saved so much on gas, lunches, work clothes, work gadgets ...whatever. I felt rich after 3 months of being back at home"
Yes all day. I'd definitely take this pay cut to WFH. However it really depends on your base salary
Totally worth it. I work from home and it's amazing. Cost benefits and the amount of time you save all add up. Car maintenance etc.
WFH changed my life. My stress level has gone down and I'm happier and more at peace. If you can afford it - do it. And if you need social interaction just plan that in the evenings. Im an introvert too so wfh works for me.
"That would 100% be worth it to me, especially with the salary you're making. Unless you're in a HCOL area and it would put you in a position that you wouldn't be able to afford your bills (but at that point, you can up and move anywhere). I was so desperate for a WFH job, I was considering jobs that would be a pay decrease of about 38%. THANKFULLY I ended up with something for my same salary so I feel I ended up ahead. This would be a no brainer to me."
"Honestly, the question here is your mental health and happiness. You hate your current job. Are you content with being miserable driving to a job you hate? Is a 13k paycut worth some happiness? Now there is no guarantee that you'll like your new job better. The other job is still a 6 figure job, so you'll still be making nice money. And if it is 100% WFH, then you will save a ton of money on gas and eating lunch out everyday at your job. 13k less salary but save a few thousand on gas and lunch. And don't forget, time and wear on your car. Time you spend driving. Time is money. It's really not as much of a pay cut as you think when you consider all the advantages you gain and money you save and don't spend. Personally, I'd take the new job and hope I'm happier with my new situation."
"Probably not, but I don't make much anyway. To me wfh is a way to make more money because no commute/meals, etc."
"Yes. For your mental health. You can always move up another org or change jobs later. Welcome to the wfh life. 

I took a pay cut a few years back from 140 to 115 4 years ago because i wasnt happy. Now i make 170k wfh and have a TS clearance."
"Think of the wear and tear on your vehicle, the extra mileage you rack up and gas. Not to mention the perks of working in your regular clothes and the 30 second commute to your desk. 

I've been WFH for 5 years now and I don't think I could go back to the office."
"Imagine you're currently WFH at this new place. You get an offer from the old place with a $13,000 raise, but you have to go to the office. Would you take that offer? This might make it more clear."
I took a similar cut for full in office to hybrid (wfh whenever I want but encouraged to come in). Worth every penny
"If you hate your current company and the benefits are the same or better (other than pay), then I say do it.  I took a 5k cut to go remote a long time ago, but ended up getting better WFH jobs along the way that paid more than the office one by far.  Your time and mental health are worth way more than 13k per year at a company you hate."
"My wife and I have this exact conversation in reverse all the time - how much more would you need to make in order to leave a WFH job for an in person one? It's at least 10% more, realistically closer to 20% to make it worthwhile."
"I've been working from home since COVID started. Since then I think I've netted maybe 10k miles on my car. 2018 Hyundai Elantra, almost paid off, and barely have 50k miles on it. I'll have that car for another 10 or so years probably.

WFH is the way to go if it works out for you."
"If I was still staying in six figs with that pay cut, hell yes. Lol. Worst case, you don't like your new company or remote work and you find something even better after that."
"You will save time and money. Just note this, as someone who works at a parts store I've seen a multitude of WFH customers that never bothered to use their car for long periods. Rodents and squirrels will chew up your wiring. Please.. drive your car every so often. Don't just let it set."
"I estimated back when the economy was in better shape, and when gasoline was a bit cheaper, and you could typically eat lunch for $9.00 or $10.00 that WFH would save me roughly $7,000.00 a year. I haven't ran the numbers for a couple years now, so it may be getting close to $13,000.00. I wouldn't take the pay cut though because then there wouldn't be any advantage for me. I'd only be breaking even. I'm also not a 6-figure earner, so it would likely make it harder on my income."
"No question that the answer here is yes. Spouse started working remotely at the beginning of the pandemic and hasn't returned to an office. Absolutely never will. Thought initially that they wouldn't like working from home. They liked the office, despite being an introvert, because they thought it helped them set some boundaries. 

Now they've realized that might've been true then but isn't now. They're still super productive; we both are. But now we eat lunch together every single day. (We both WFH, I did for a decade-plus pre-Covid.) We sleep in more. We leave our desks early and take evening walks. We're *both* extra flexible now and free to run midday errands as needed, like pick up the (dramatically underused) car from the mechanic or to take a last-minute medical appointment as needed. We're also at risk for Covid complications so frankly, the extra safety of not being in an office is invaluable. And we don't waste time (or money) commuting. If necessary, we'd both take big pay cuts to keep this forever. 

Enjoy your forthcoming freedom!!"
Not even a question in my book. WFH 100%
As a remote worker - yes 100%
"WFH is a game changer. 

If possible, check how the company handles it, do they micro manage? Install monitoring software on the remote computers? Etc. 

If it looks good, you'll have more time for yourself and your family. Save a lot on gas, mileage on your car (I changed mine to a vehicle for recreation using less than 3000 miles a year with my insurance provider for a huge discount), healthier lunches, more exercise and walks during the day, if you have a dog they will love you even more if that is possible.

You will be gaining a lot WFH."
"I WFH now and would not RTO for $13k. That said, unless a company is 100% remote 1st (Aha!, Gitlab, etc.) There's a chance RTO will be implemented at any time. It would suck to change jobs, then deal with RTO for less money.
This is the season of RTO, so I would not risk it right now."
"If you are unhappy with the current job, than yes, 100%.  I think a good boss alone is worth $13K at your salary range.  Throw in work from home?  Oh yeah!"
"Time in commute, buying lunch (because who are we kidding, no one brings lunch 5 days a week :)), and time from commute and getting ready and then chores after work - it all adds up. So I think I would take a 13K cut.
Wfh you can have those chores to be done during your work hours (laundry, cleaning, making food, etc) and have a free evening every day. Plus you get to have home cooked meals more often and sleep in!:)"
"Math incoming:
If you work full time, 2080 hours a year, 260 days a year, and your commute is 80 minutes daily, 3x a week, then you're spending just under 208 hours a year commuting.

At $118,000 annual salary, your hourly wage is $56.73

$56.73 x 208 = $11,799.84

The $13k pay cut is entirely reflected in you not needing to drive to work anymore (you don't keep the full $13k due to income taxes).

Factor in the savings from less annual vehicle maintenance, less gas for car, lower insurance premium due to no more work commute (they factor your commute in, tell them you're work from home driving 0 miles on average. You might need to shop around to see who has the best policies for people that don't commute to work), you can save money making food at home instead of buying lunch at work if that's what you used to do.

Your home electricity bill will probably go up slightly.


If you ask me, the work from home job has essentially equal pay, but it gives you more time to enjoy your life instead spending an extra 208 hours of your life driving to and from work (not counting days where there's a car accident/traffic that increase your commute time?)"
"Consider this - it may also bump you into a lower tax bracket depending on other factors. 

But the ability to pocket savings on gas/car to save up for a more reliable one while still working is huge.  

You'll also save on some incidental expenses; lunches and snacks if you were ever inclined to spend on those. The down side is your utilities will be higher since you will be taking advantage of hearing and cooling for 40+ more hours a week.  So it might be a wash.  

I wfh most days, and I love most about it, but I do find Zoom to be strangely fatiguing and a bit falsely performative. Invest in a good camera and mic, and treat anything that can be seen from your work area as part of a 'movie set' in terms of privacy and professionalism."
"I am WFH, if I was offered like $50K more I would consider changing to in office"
"Wfh is the best. I would. 
I would negotiate with the current company for wfh."
"It's not that much when you account for saved taxes on income, better benefits, reduced car wear and tear and costs, benefits from wfh like not buying dress clothes, more free time, getting more done during the day. You might even end up ahead."
"You have all the numbers, salary, benefits value, commute times, and happiness level at both companies. Compare the numbers and come up with the value of WFH for you. 

For me, the difference is in being able to take a vacation to another city and during the week, work for two or three days at the vacation location and bust my butt and get everything done in under 8 hours, sometimes in 3-4 hours, and then have free extra vacation.

I get about 30-50% more vacation simply due to the flexibility of WFH. I take 2 days off for a 9 day trip since it covers 2 weekends."
Remote work 4 lyfe .
"You're already WFH two days per week, so you're taking a $13k cut to save you 240 minutes of commute each week.

You need to look at how much that will save you on gas, whether you'll be more productive or less stressed, and whether the loss in both pay and benefits (A 6:3.5 match on 118 is lower than on 105, so even if everything's identical you're still going to see some differences) is worth it.

The fact that you loathe your current company is a big selling point for making the jump here, in addition to the fact that once you demonstrate you are capable of holding a job at full work from home status and doing well, you are much more hireable by other WFH companies.

I went full WFH back in \~2018 and I've not worked a day on prem ever since, outside of the very rare on site meeting (Usually an annual thing)."
"Personally, since you're already WFH twice a week, then for me it would depend on how much I like the job. That to me seems more important than both the $13k salary difference and the hybrid vs fully remote question. And since you don't like your current job, it seems like you should take the new one. 

I'm doing a hybrid job that I like and personally wouldn't take a $13k pay cut to be fully remote. But if I hated my current job, I would probably make the move."
"Although I am already WFH, I'd take the paycut in a heart beat.  But do the math.  Cost for gas, insurance, wear and tear on car, tolls If applicable, clothing allowance, shoes, eating out plus the cost investment for the time you gain not having to drive, get dressed, hair/makeup if you're female and it applies (that craps not cheap either), plus lessened risk of car accident.  You're making decent money; it's just about how the math and mental health benefits work for you."
"100% yes. Do it! The fact that you are already unhappy at current job and want to leave is just lagniappe. 

Also, you'll most likely save a good portion of that pay cut by not commuting and other expenses that add up when you leave your home. 

P.S. get the *permanent* time-frame for WFH terms written explicitly into your contract!! Best of luck!

edit: spelling"
"I agree that you should take the position for full time work from home.  But I would also chip in that no\* company offers the most they can pay in their first offer.  They will always try to get you for a cheap as they can.  It's expected that people will negotiate offers, but most people aren't willing to try.

Counter offer.  Even if they say no you can pivot to more PTO, a larger bonus, a sign on bonus, or guaranteed pay increase after your first year so they can have time to ""budget"" for it.

""The offer is very attractive to me, but I'm not thrilled about taking a $13,000 pay cut.  How about you meet me halfway at $110,000?""

\*I'm not familiar with every company in the world, but I've experienced enough of them and my spouse was high level HR for her career."
"Hell yeah. Let's say I need to drive an hour round trip to go into the office. $13k won't cover all those hours for a year. I think I am still coming out way ahead WFH with a $13k pay decrease.

Now I am sure this depends on how much you make. If you make minimum wage, you need that $13k. If you make $130k+, you almost won't notice missing $13k a year."
"I make half the amount and raises are far and few between.

We have company wide meetings twice a year where it's a 2 hour drive round trip.

I work 4 - 10's and it's a dream schedule.

Permanent WFH is such a huge stress reliever."
"I'd absolutely take that cut for work from home. $13,000, so maybe $700ish less per month take home. Then you minus out reduced car insurance, reduced car repairs, reduced gas, reduced clothing allowance. So then you're maybe at $400 less a month. Then pay yourself your hourly rate of $50ish for the commute, that's at least $300. Forgive my bad back of the envelope math, but I can't see it being a huge difference."
Don't do it. If they decide to end WFH you are out the benefit you are paying 13K a year for.
"I wfh and love it,  if I had to do a pay cut to do it, I would..ur saving on gas, lunch, and work attire...it may even out of u compare over a year what u spend on these things currently...best to u with whatever u decide.."
"Time is money. $105k for easy math purposes is rounded to 50/hr. 
You drive about an hour a day 240 days per year. At $50 a hour your commute time is worth $12k a year. 
That was a lot of rounding so actually your per hour rate is about the same in both jobs if you include travel time. 

In my experience you save more time than just your commute too. When I work from home I spend less time getting ready because it doesn't matter as much what I look like, I don't have to pack a lunch or organize what I need to take with me, etc."
"So, the expected pay bump for switching jobs should be about 15-20%. That's not always accurate, but that's the average. So if you are taking a lower salary for this remote job, let's calculate the opportunity cost. 

&#x200B;

Current salary: $118k

Expected job switch salary: $135k

Remote salary offer: $105k 

&#x200B;

So your real loss here isn't $13k, it's roughly $30k. Maybe a little bit less since you just switched jobs 1 year ago. 

Let's give the new job the benefit of the doubt on the benefits. 401k match is usually up to about 3 or 4%, so let's say that's worth $4k. Let's say that a more generous bonus rounds that up to $10k. 

Then let's add 1:30 of commute 3 days a week. That's easily $1k of gas a year. That's also about $8-10k worth of time (based on what your salary shows your time as worth). Depending on your field, you might literally be able to take the 5ish hours a week you would be commuting and turn that into freelance money. 

&#x200B;

Based on the above I would essentially have the following values:

&#x200B;

Current salary: $118k

Remote offer + benefits: $124k

&#x200B;

With all that said, there are two more questions. 

&#x200B;

1. Are there other jobs out there? If this is a common role I would keep looking tons of jobs are remote now. You shouldn't have to take a pay cut for remote work anymore. Personally, I think you can find a remote job that pay more than your current job if you look enough. 
2. Remote work has a tendency to run beyond a 9-5. The above math is based around the idea that you are actually getting an extra 1.5 hours a day back to yourself. In my experience, that is rarely the case."
">My current company is a 35 minute drive in and a 45 min drive home. I work from home two days a week. \[...\]  
>  
>Edit: Current is 118k and new would be 105k.

At your income I wouldn't take a \~10% pay cut solely to go from WFH 2 days/week to WFH full time. HOWEVER...

>I loathe my current company and that's why I am looking for a new job.

I absolutely *would* take a \~10% pay cut to escape a job I hated. I'd say take the new job."
"Having worked from home for 10 years, I'd say it's worth the cut. Not only does WFH put more free time back in your day and reduce overhead, it eliminates risk of traffic accidents going to and from work."
"Yes for sure. Currently looking for a WFH job and would totally take a pay cut to get it. If you can afford to do it, I would say do it for sure."
"11% pay cut to not commute. Yup. I'd take that 

Except my wife works from home and she REALLY prefers that I go into the office.

But I think that's a fair trade. In days I do work from home, I get an extra 2 hours...... By the time I figure that getting ready in the morning is quicker, no commute, and I can do a couple of my ""after work"" chores during the day."
"I took a 20K cut, don't regret it. Now I have remote work experience and can potentially apply anywhere else with higher pay if I wanted to. However, I'm happy at the moment, but I'm always re-assessing the possibilities."
A dollar saved is worth two made.  Commute costs of $.62 per mile wouldnt take long to cover it.  Get work from home guarantee in writing and irrevocable.  You are taking a pay cut.  I had an employer reneg - located between 2 toll roads.  No one would work there if they didn't pull that shit.  It was a dangerous area with tax abatements.  City made up the tax abatement tax by screwing the commuters with tolls.  Daily tolls alone were $10.00s.
"Nope. I just took a WFH job that pays nearly double.

That took me up to 150k for context though, and for the work I do, there's a lot more room.

So it depends on your line of work. If you have more room to move up, I'd wait for the right opportunity for that. If you're close to the ceiling for your field then I'd probably do it"
Yea I work from home and love it.
I'd consider what the chance is they will require you to come back into the office. A lot of companies that hired remote workers are now having them come back...
"Absolutely yes, take the WFH job. You'll capture almost an hour and a half three days a week - that's significant!"
"13k a year? Eh why not I piss that.
13k a month, should be fine if I cut the avocado toast out.
Can't wfh at my job but it's a fun thought exercise."
"This is both easy mathematically and easy in reality. Assuming you work 45 hr per week, you actually make a bit more per hour by working remotely and take the $13,000 cut. More importantly. You had your job. 

Leave. Eat the cash. You're still making great money. If you want to make an extra 13 grand, freelance."
"I've been fully remote for 4 years and 40-50% for the 6 years before that. I would absolutely demand a 10k+ raise to take a job in the office. I would not, however take a 10k cut to gain it. Not because it isn't worth it, but because every couple years an executive position gets a new ass in its seat that's opposed to remote work and I have to fight to keep it. It could vanish in an instant and I'd be left with a lower pay.

That's the problem with fringe benefits, they're not guaranteed forever."
"If the WFH applies globally, then I'd do it in a heartbeat."
"Took a 7.5k pay cut recently to stay remote, and I don't make nearly as much as you. The pay cut is very much worth getting to keep my my current work-life balance as a remote worker. As someone else pointed out, 13k would basically be spent on driving expenses like gas and maintenance on your vehicle (or car payments if you had to get a new car) plus drive time if converted to your hourly rate of labor. If the lower pay doesn't affect your lifestyle significantly I'd say spring for the remote position!"
"Are you trolling? So, you will take a pay cut but still make 6 figures? Why is your car breaking down if you make this kind of money? Are you bad at managing your money? Posts like this come off as subtle brags and it's annoying. 

In short, you're miserable at your 6-figure job so take another 6-figure job so you can wfh and be happy. There, I figured it out for you."
"Sounds like that is what you would pay in commuting costs and maybe more with car repairs and lunch, clothing, etc.

I saved about the same now that I WFH permanently. If it were a decision to cut my salary by that much, I would be ok with it. Also if  there are increases/bonuses you should get that back in time."
I wouldn't personally even with a brand new 60k vehicle you'd still be able to make more. I think it depends on if you have an emotional reason for wanting to work from home.
Having to commute to work and any kind of money you spend on going out to eat lunch or meals will be made up if you work from home. I've found that I save so much more money working from home as I have the luxury of making breakfast and lunch without worrying about time constraints of having to go back to the office during breaks.
"$13k a year gone but WFH at your tax bracket is like $5-6k after taxes. You would be saving what you lost in commuter expenses and you would get that time back.

Worth it."
I took a $10k year pay cut to wfh and ended being denied later on because I didn't meet the internet speed requirement of 100mb download. This was never mentioned in the interview or offer.  So yeah you make a good point.
"I agree! OP needs to take the WFH gig and never look back!

I have a WFH consulting gig. I enjoy what I do, and I love the flexibility because I work on special projects and can basically work whenever I want (do have to be available for scheduled client calls, etc., as needed) as long as I work at least 40 hours a week (option to work more if I want). If I were offered a 100% pay increase to drive 30 minutes each way to an office and be there 8-5 I would turn it down."
How have you managed? Have you been waiting for a fully WFH position without getting an offer? Your post makes me feel concerned for you...
"OP's pay scale is my income bracket.  I'm not in tech per se, but do construction estimating.  I'm fully remote, but my job is staring at screens and numbers all day, so I can do that anywhere.  Also, it allows my employer (Boston area) to get me at a bit of a discount, as I'm located in the south, so lower cost of living.  It would take a SUBSTANTIAL pay increase to commute.  I was weary of remote work before, but the time you get back is just so damn valuable."
"Lots of industries have WFH options now with much higher salaries really. Depends what they do, level, and location."
"Yeah, I played with the numbers a bit in another comment. My example used comparatively equal 5% raises, 10% bonus and 3% 401k match over 5yrs: loss in year 1 is 14.7k, but it's 18.7k by year 5. Total loss in 5yr is 99.9k NOT including investment impact of lower contributions over time which compound to 10s of 1000s easily over time.

Of course, this is lower if all the % ages go down and higher if they go up, but I don't think I'd put the value of WFH at an average of 20k/yr...which is then 17% pay cut and a much bigger number than the initial value appears."
"Honestly, being stuck in a terrible work environment will hamper your future growth much more than taking a pay cut for a lateral move.

Even if it *wasn't* WFH I would strongly consider moving.

It would probably be easier to ""move up"" in your career from this remote job than it would be trying to survive AND skill-up in your current one."
"I would do that.  My company went remote (technically hybrid so I cant leave the state, but I never go into an office) and the longer I work from home the cost it would take for me to take a job in the office more than once a week keeps going up.  

The quality of life changes are dramatic.  Like you can do laundry and whatnot through the day as it only takes 2 minutes to stop-start loads and ALL OF THAT COMMUTE TIME. My commute turned into gym time, in the best shape since high school."
"Also, I saved money from not eating out when I started wfh. I eat out a lot less now because it's easier to walk to the pantry for a snack if I'm hungry."
"In that case, 100% yes I would take the WFH job!"
See if you can get another week of paid vacation. But yeah WFH for 13k less is probably worth it if we are comparing the cost of commute
"I would take this deal especially if you hate your current job. All things being equal.

Just keep in mind that wfh can be isolating."
"The question is if I could not leave my house to work for 105,000/yr.... I make 80k driving thirty minutes one direction, sit in an office I hate, and am forced to eat lunch surrounded by people who want to be there as little as I do.... Yeah, I'd immediately do that. I'd do anything ti work from home, especially if it meant I made more than 100k/yr."
"It's likely you save 5k in gas and another 1k in car maintenance. Also you can call your car insurance and change the coverage for leisure use (4k miles per year ) and many save a few hundred more. 

So my guess would be at minimum it's now a $7k difference.


Now considered how heavily taxed earnings are above 90k.... It's likely that can account for another $1-2k because of the tax tiers.

So now where talking perhaps a $5k difference....



Okay let's go further... Were you stopping at Starbucks on the way to work, or on the drive home?  Did you buy lunches at work? Did you shop for more expensive lunch food that was more convenient?

Add work clothes. Yes obviously there's overlap between work clothes and home clothes but chances are you shop for appropriate clothes with work in mind.
However if you are on zoom this difference between clothes won't be huge, I imagine.


Obviously you will likely have to invest some money on a home office setting but I still think it's much cheaper to be at home. That might be tax deductible too. 

Im guessing the real yearly savings clothes, car, food, taxes comes closer to a $3-4k gap than a 
$13k gap."
"You're making plenty.

What I would do, is make it it a 3 year contract. 

You don't want to take a pay decrease, and then find out they were lying about the WFH."
"I been working remote for 5 years now, I have actively turned down roughly 5 jobs that paid about 12k more. Remote work is amazing, and the intrinsic benefits are great. I am considering going back to work in office hybrid wise but it's only for positions that interest me regardless of pay. I would recommend taking a pay cut, but /u/nictakit brought up a great point, lets say someone makes 75k and it would cut to 62k that's a big deal. But you probably wont notice a HUGE difference in lifestyle if you go from 115 to 105. Cause things like gas, insurance, and car maintenance get a lot cheaper. Also, one starts eating out less because you are already home so its MORE work to get something out."
"also working from home you don't need to fix or buy a new car, which would likely be more than the 13k difference anyway. also, think about what you value more, time or money. you would have a lot more time for yourself without the commute and being able to wfh"
"WFH jobs typically give you monthly stipends for internet and office supplies, and you'll save on commuting, wear and tear on your car, any ""work clothes"". That adds up!  You can always ask for a sign on to offset it for a year or so until you get your yearly raise.

Do it!"
"How old are you?  the younger you are, the more valuable extra money is.  If you're 25 I'd say ,no, keep the extra 13k and deal with commuting.  If you're 45, WFH for sure."
"Yes, if I couldn't find WFH at the higher rate I'd take the cut so that I could continue to WFH"
"Almost certainly. Unless living expenses are already stretched thin. But I would give up luxuries, vacations, and a small bit of savings for fully remote work. Some costs, like transportation, may offset that, too."
"Lemme put it this way, I have 90% WFH and make around $105k. I sure as hell wouldn't switch to an in person job and that commute for $118k"
Oh yeah I'd personally opt for the Wfh role.
"Better make sure it's permanently WFH, as in, get that in writing. You may kick yourself if they decide to go hybrid or full-in office, following the CEO big wig company bandwagon going on right now."
"If i will be taking a pay cut but wfh, i will consider having that on the contract so that when they decided to RTO, you can show them your contract. I had a colleague who applied for a technical project manager position and she is capable of doing the work, but she had requested to put on the contract that she won't be doing any technical work. Whenever someone asks, she will always refer to the contract."
"My company tried to do that (minus the paycut) for those who didn't return to the office post-Covid.  We had to take a picture of a speed test.  I had been working remotely all through Covid, and worked from home on dial-up in the 90s, so I thought it was insane.  I kept running the speed test over and over again, and temporarily hardwired it to the router to pass.  Xfinity did upgrades in my neighborhood a couple months later, but it was a close call then."
"If your commute is what you state, I have to imagine you won't miss that 13k that much between gas, time, and maintenance.

Maybe ask what non-money types of compensation they can offer you.  It can't hurt.  Also, what is your career path there, what are the annual reviews (and raises/COL) like? Can they pay for some of your home office expenses, stuff like that.  10ish % of your salary isn't that big of a deal at your pay level and your happiness is way important."
"This is the correct answer. If you're commuting 1 hour each day, your work week is 5 hours longer than WFH. I 100% include this in my calculations when negotiating salary. My time is my time, period.

Also, you're physically trapped at the office for 40 hours, whether you're doing anything productive or not. If management isn't living in the dark ages and measures performance with meaningful metrics - are you meeting your deliverables, and is it quality work? - WFH frees you from the shackles of time. If you can knock out 40 hours worth of work in 30 hours, you reclaim the 10 hour difference for yourself."
"Even if the funds are tied up.  He hates current company, and remote work is a benefit worth a lot more than the 9 % payout."
"I was WFH for 5 years with 20Mb 4G until fibre arrived early this year. It was absolutely fine.

Would I go back to it from 2Gb fibre? HELL NO!"
If you love the office then why are you here in the wfh sub?
"I believe You can claim the square footage of your home office for tax deductions amongst other things.

Edit: I guess w2 employees can't do this !"
it depends on the company n how they have that set up. i have worked for 3 different remote companies where services r contracted out to other companies n i was never able to claima cent for home office set up smdh
"Claiming a room or square footage automatically flags you with IRS, but as some stated, you can't do it anyway as a W2 employee. I run my own corporation and I still have never claimed any home office, but I claim everything else. What you should still be able to do is claim Internet access and a laptop/desktop if not provided for you, and a land line or cell phone, even pen and paper.  Anything you spend money on to support your work. There will still be a few things you can claim on your taxes."
"that's how this works. You pay income tax wherever the office is but when you wfh you pay income tax based on where you live  


he is correct and you do save money this way. You can also earn more money if the overtime laws are better in the state you are remoting from"
"It really boils down to this. The majority of the CEOs out there pushing RTO are at companies with large to massive amount of money tied up in commercial real estate. They want their people to RTO for nothing more than to justify those expenditures. They're speaking out because they think, and perhaps rightfully so, that they can convince other CEOs to jump on the RTO bandwagon. They NEED those other CEOs because they know talent will continue to leave their companies in search of positions at companies that are still WFH. Its all about money and leverage, they lost the ""productivity"" battle when companies didn't immediately go bankrupt in 2020 when everyone went remote."
"How is WFH a right? It was a 3 year experiment where the majority of companies were forced to send home most workers that didn't even have business working from home. It was derived from a made up pandemic that the fatality rate of an average worker in the US was about .005%...lower then the Flu. Get it out of your head that this is some established policy,  WFH was never the norm, still is not .... your vacation is over.."
">This is what I tell my reports - you get paid for 8 hours you only work 8 hours - if someone demands more from you tell me and I will have words with them.  If you finish your work in less than 8 hours - I do not care.  Results is what matters.

You are kind of sending a mixed message. Either the are getting paid for the hours they work or the results they achieve.  If they are being paid for the hours, then they should work the hours even if they are finished the task (ie move on to the next thing). If they are paid for the result, then the hours don't matter and working less or more than 8 hours is not a factor. 

I tend to think blending these two ideas is causing issues for WFH. The jobs that are purely about someone working certain hours with routine tasks seems to work well, and the jobs that are based on results/ a project completed work well."

"A lot of people in this WFH crowd are salaried, so that doesn't apply."
"True, but it's rare to be salary exempt especially in a corporate office setting, which are what most WFH jobs are."
"That sounds like a tough situation. You want to see actual representation and solidarity from management regarding your WFH status, but it doesn't seem like you are getting that support.

I suggest a meeting with your boss and airing your concerns. If he or she doesn't seem empathetic... then it could be time to move on (which is easier said than done)

Fuck what's happening right now. America is flying backwards at 100mph, and it's really sad to see it on this sub."
"Honestly, based on how things sound, I wouldn't be surprised if they would be looking for any reason to remove you in the future (given your situation and how hostile they are to WFH). I would personally be looking for a new job ASAP."
"I do not see why you feel the need to explain your WFH arrangement with the rest of the company.

If your boss is happy then everything is just noise, including HR.

200 miles from the office though! One heck of a long commute "
"You need to job hunt. Your boss may be protecting you for now, but 3x/month ask is insane (and they should be reimbursing your mileage) and if there's one issue, you may be under more scrutiny than the in-office folks. 

Your company also clearly doesn't believe in data since it's been proven over and over that wfh is more productive."
"This is just further proof that companies that don't put remote first are doomed to fail at long term remote work. The company culture and attitude has to change to put remote works first, rather than as an add-on. The company I work for (massive govt consulting company) originally wasn't a WFH company. We're diverse and spread out (office everywhere) that remote was possible, but at the time it was an add-on. The preference was thast you work out of what ever nearest office there was to your location.  We did have some people remote, and even some of our sub-contractors were remote, but at the end of the day we were a in-office company. Then COVID happened... the writing was on the wall, and so it was announced that were were going to try one day to have everyone work from home to test the infrastructure.  It got scheduled for a Friday .... Thursday we packed up, took what we needed home .... and that's the last time we were officially in the office. Over the weekend, things shut down. The offices opened up one day so we could retrieve any items left behind, and then that was it. Eventually there was talk about RTO and what that would mean post-COVID. It was pretty much guaranteed to be a hybrid situation, it was a matter of what the combination would be .... then two things happened.... 1) the numbers started coming in. People were happier. Productivity shot up over 30% in the first six months... and stayed there. The reasons why were obvious - people weren't spending two hours commuting to work, getting all pissy and being grumpy. Needless interruptions topped. 2) The kicker though was the CEO woke up one morning and thought to himself that he really didn't feel like working in the office any more. That was the turning point. RTO talk stopped, and the directive came down ""make this work"" ... My team is spread out all over the place. SC, NY, Va, TN, UT, CO ...hell there's one guy on another team who doesn't have a perm address anymore, just a PO box somewhere... he's leading the nomadic life. Last I heard he was in Idaho. The only restriction we have - and it's because of govt restrictions - is that you have to be CONUS (Continetal US)... other than that.... got internet? then no problem. 

Asking if a position is WFH or 100% remote isn't sufficient. Even remote friendly isn't good enough these days. The real question to ask is if ""the company is remote-first or is it 'a perk' and an after-thought?"""
"Its hard, but ignore the spiteful  and enjoy only having to see them occasionally. These are just petty stupid individuals gobbling up ViRtuAl BaD propaganda. People who hate wfh cause they were told are  unhappy ignoramuses who support more pollution, traffic, crime, and  higher gas prices just to make others suffer. It must hurt to be like that. They are not worth your thoughts  them"
"3 times a month? pfft fk that. Brush up your CV and find a 100% remote job.

You havn't really made it clear how important you are but if they value you then give them the ultimatum you want full time work from home, and a pay rise. Or you'll take the other job. I they don't deliver then move on. People get WAY to attached to their jobs. I'd leave mine in a heartbeat for no reason at all. Its just a job 100 more like it."
"I would never ever drive that much for a job. Especially without a real reason. Just cause ""we don't like WFH"" is not a reason. At the very least they should reimburse you for travel. 

Also it sounds like the place is a overall hostile and you aren't getting any support from management. It seems like management is stuck in another era and making decisions based on cultural politics. All of this is reason enough to look for another job. 

I notice in the comments you have anxiety about leaving. Fear of regret. Second guessing your own instincts. Have you tried therapy?"
"Good Christ no, don't whine about wfh to one's boss."
"Thanks for your comment! Absolutely spot on. I think it's all down to the CEO and what they value. Because if the CEO thinks WFH is abused, or doesn't buy into it for 'cultural' or whatever other reason, then it absolutely can't work as their approach would dictate who they hire etc. I love the sound of your job and the flexibility it affords you all, as well as the fact it likely means you get to work with super talented people all around CONUS."
"The thing is, my boss is really accommodating and used to this. I just don't see a point of bringing WFH issues to him though, especially related to the rest of my colleagues as he might then start to see my setup increasingly as a problem! My anxiety about leaving isn't overwhelming or impacting my life to the point I need therapy I don't think, it's just I genuinely am good and enjoy the job. Or the work, rather. And I wonder whether chasing a perfect work environment is realistic or whether having downsides - what I described being mine - just just part of any job."
"That's not right, though. It's about your value and how your peers see you wfh. She should be supported in her position and not made to feel like she is 'getting away with it'"
The company is hostile to wfh. Boss is gonna do what their boss is.
"It's not a sudden charge. Edited to add the commute isn't the problem for me as this setup has been in place for over a year. It's the increase hostility to WFH that is more or less new (the media doesn't help!!!) and it's the fact that as more and more people get hired (no one remote or even hybrid, of course) my arrangement becomes more and more unusual and I feel like I keep having to perform my productivity to dispel myths about WFH. The annoying thing is that like I said I love the work and am great at what I do. The work fit to my skillset is perfect."
"I am hybrid at work and if I were to relocate to another area, but still in commute distance, I would not ask permission and I would only update my tax information and personnel record. Unless your handbook or employment contract states otherwise, you're still in commute distance for your job because you are WFH and hired as such.

Personally I would just have a quick word with my HR rep but along the lines of ""okay I need to update my address and tax withholding. How do we swap the tax stuff?"" Considering you have other employees working for the same legal entity (right?) In the state you are moving, it shouldn't be a problem. 

Don't ask permission. Don't seek approval. Be prepared if you are leaving a HCOL area for a lower one, they might try to adjust your salary."
"As a current payroll person who deals with wfh/hybrid/office workers please don't move without notice. Taxes will be a nightmare. States, counties, cities and school districts all tax differently."
"I'm also planning to move in the next six months but not out of state.

I already informed my dept head of my upcoming moving plan. I informed them now and if moving a few hundreds of miles away means losing my WFH job then so be it. They will lose a top performer.

We all have to make life choices and companies have to make theirs. I can't waste my energy and worry about what they think of me WFH from even further locations."
"In your work, who do you interface with? If the people you answer to are not local to you when you move, you have a case where it makes no sense to come to the office. 

I also WFH 45 min from my headquarters. My team was classes as virtual, luckily before the pandemic and we remain that way. My boss is completely supportive of 100% remote, and her boss is in another city so doesn't care where we work. On my projects, I'm working with people in all times and have no reason to go to my office.

IT will know if you're logging in regularly from somewhere else.

Your manager sounds like they could be your advocate here, so do explain how you love working there.

It would be good, too, if you could be open to moving and having to go to the office a few times a week, then after a few months negotiate a better schedule."
"We would be moving to a city where there are considerably more opportunities than where I am now (I'm in the boonies of upstate NY, an hour from Albany, and we'd be moving to a mid-size city on the east coast further down south).  I don't know if I'd be able to get a WFH job which I would prefer, but there would be more job opportunities in general."
"I doubt this is the case. There are tax implications to consider when allowing remote work. Moving across town won't make a difference. Moving to another state absolutely does, especially if your company doesn't have any presence in that state. 
If someone moves out of state, they have mismatched information on their tax forms. W-2 will have old address but your filing under your new address. That goes for any type of legal documents that involve work. 
Also, depends on the industry but in my industry we have to certify the accuracy of financial statements annually and there would be no way to explain why the addresses on different forms are different."
Amazing! What field? It's been hard to find remote work the past few months
I underestimated how much I would miss remote work even when I go in once a week..... Currently looking because of that and I don't like my role lol
"WFH is remote (usually), but remote isn't always WFH."
"WFH can literally mean your permanent office location is your house. My wife WFH for a company before the pandemic, and had to get special permission from HR to work remotely. Depending on policies around security and/or PCI you may be restricted to your actual home location.

I work remotely and can pretty much set up shop anywhere in the US."
" ""remote"" may mean you  may not have an office location, but are expected to work at multiple sites, where travel is required This was the more common meaning of ""remote"" prior to COVID.  WFH specifies that you are able to work from home 

When Covid hit, these terms got jumbled/mislabeled/used interchably"
"In my experience, and I've had the ability to wfh since the 90s. Most of my team is remote. Some are at home, some are in some kind of other situation like in-laws house, library, beach, cafe, hotels, airports. I don't care, the work is being done it is irrelevant where it is done. They have VPN, they know what the limitations are with following tax laws and residency and stuff and we're good."
"Almost no job listing is going to call it ""Work from home"".  The term is ""remote""."
"My job is a hybrid job with WFH. You are technically not permitted to work anywhere but your home or our office location.

If you are on vacation or occasionally work from another location it's probably fine."
"WFH or Remote doesn't make a difference. I am ""home"" when I am working and that home just might be here where my main residence is or it may be at my in-laws in Fl. If I do my job during work hours when it's expected who gives a flying toucan where I am? If your employer does move on. I work remote because my work speaks for itself and if location is an issue what if I move or lose internet or where I am freeze to death when the whole power grid dies for two weeks. I was able to use my hot spot or go to a place with generators and work when others couldn't. To me if it's more productive to have options. I was remote all during Covid and then my company was purchased I was laid off for 1 month found another job where they said you must sit in your home office 8hrs a day period. I quit found another job that same week and back to normal doing my thing. If I have internet my laptop and cell I'm working."
"Pre-pandemic my in-office job allowed us to work from home occasionally if we had a repair person coming, if we didn't feel well, etc. So back then, WFH meant a one-off day working at home, physically. 

I think that might be similar to how people in hybrid roles use the term WFH -- to indicate the days they're at home vs in office. 

Now, I'm in a full-time remote job, but when people ask me about it, the phrasing is usually ""You work from home, right?"" or something similar, just because it's a more everyday way to speak. 

I have done work at locations away from home - occasionally at the airport, hospital, etc. I don't do important meetings or collaborative sessions in public places out of respect for my colleagues. I do run errands during the day but check email and Teams frequently on my phone to ensure I'm still responsive while I'm away from my desk. 

I don't think there's a blanket rule that people who work in coffee shops are ruining remote work. There are considerate and inconsiderate employees working remote just like they both exist in-office."
"Job dependent. 

My job is 100% remote but I'm gone away from home that 100% of the time. I work a rotation where I'm home and I'm off, otherwise I'm gone and working. 

I had another job that was also 100% remote. I was home working about 1-2 months of the year (I could have been anywhere in the country, they wouldn't have cared as they're set up in every state) and I was gone the rest of the year. 

I think WFH jobs are all a little different and some require that single point of work since that legally becomes your office as far as the company is concerned. 

Remote tends to have a bit more flexibility but you're still typically restricted to a state that your company operates in and unless you're in specific situations you have tax implications there. 

My industry has something where I'm only taxed at my home address / nearest office since we're transportation there's something with that. So it doesn't matter that I've, for example, worked in ND for over 30 days this year so far, I'm taxed in my home state and it's legit because of the industry."
"I work remotely. My employer only allows employees to work from home. Absolutely nowhere else, as we work with confidential client information. Your home residence and that's it. 

We also have to continue to live locally.

My employer had no remote jobs until 2020, when we got sent home. There's some staff who had to go back into the office, but most haven't. We might have to go back either on a hybrid schedule or full time, but its still up in the air.

We all also work the same schedules we did in the office."
"I will work from the airport or while traveling, but it won't be my best work for sure.  I really can't write code on the go as I need my workstation.  The one time I was going to be working remotely and not from my home office for an extended period I packed my travel docking station and trackball, and bought an okay monitor and a reasonable keyboard at my destination (was there for a month).  I just left the stuff behind when I traveled home."
"People who WFH and everywhere else annoy me..Taking advantage of a good thing. I'm with you, I use PTO if I'm on vacation.  I'm too old to BS companies or get fired over stupid crap. I know at the beginning for us you can go to a building (same company) that's closer."
"Depends on the company. If your policy is that you should only be working from your approved location then yeah those people could ruin remote work for everyone. 

However, a lot of remote companies (mine included) do not require you to work from location. As long as your work is completed and you're being careful of sensitive info then someone working from a different location can be just as productive and is doing nothing wrong."
"Correct. Remote can mean working from a customer site. If you're in sales, you may WFH some or most of the time but be a customer sites for sales meetings and such."
"Yes, exactly this! And some employers require hardwired internet. 

My sister and I live in different states and we both work remotely. I can stay with her and work from her house but she can't do the same. Her job is strictly WFH and her employer has installed internet in her house. 

A family member has been WFH for 20+ years in the compliance field. I remember her telling me a while back about her coworker who got in trouble for transferring the compliance hotline to her cell phone when she was on call. I'd be curious to know how her job works now with the more modern technology that's available."
"If I had just gotten permanent WFH the last thing I'd do would be to stick my head up and risk rocking the boat and having them reevaluate their decision over a measly 2.5 hours a week. 

Quietly take the W and be absolutely thrilled about never having to go into the office."
">  I went on ADA for several months

Does this mean that you formally requested an accomodation allowing you to work from home?

And was it granted in writing?

> When I started my job from the office, it's always been 37.5 hrs/week considered full-time salary. 

> I received a separate email indicating my hours were now 40/week.

If you got approved for permanent WFH I wouldn't ask too many questions.  You are salary so it doesn't really matter."
I'm sorry but I can't imagine even noticing the difference of 30 minutes a day? How are they tracking your hours that closely? I'm salary WFH I just put 8 hours on my timesheet every day and do my job. Sometimes I work more than that sometimes a little less but whatever.
"You are saving how many hours in a commute a week for an extra half an hour a day, at salary? 

Your commute played into your permanent accommodation to work from home. You no longer have the commute and they want their full salary's worth of your time in exchange, which comes out to 30 minutes longer daily. This is a boat I wouldn't dare rock especially if they're pulling people back to the office."
"Maybe you have been down voted a lot because you seem a bit naive- a company can change there work policies involving hours whenever they want.  There doesn't have to be any logic to it at all; as long as it doesn't violate some law, they are good.  

So why are you wondering so hard or care so much about 2.5 hours a week when the bigger picture is you get to stay WFH."

"I don't think they are necessarily tracking that; it does add up over time, though. 

A couple users mentioned job reclassification, and I went back to the handbook again and finally found it.

The employee handbook has been updated to include employee classifications that reflect hours based on location (such as home office +2 other locations) 37.5 and 40 (other locations) as Regular Full-Time,"" and they've added remote workers into their own category as 'all other locations and remote' as ""regular part time,"" so it looks like there's the logic I was looking for.

So of course, now I'm looking for the implications (other than hours) of the reclass. 

Thanks for your input. I appreciate it.

*Edit: Upon further review, both the FT and PT are listed based on location and hours; I will review what I'm listed in workday to confirm."
"You're exactly right. I went back to the handbook again and finally found it.

"Completely agree; WFH has been a lifesaver for me for many reasons. A couple users did help me figure out that remote workers were reclassified from Regular Full Time to Regular Part Time status. Thanks for taking the time to share that link, too!!great reminder for sure."
"I wanted to follow up on your comment about 30+ hours. 

A couple users mentioned job reclassification, and so I went back to the handbook again and finally found it's been updated to include employee classifications that reflect hours based on location (such as home office +2 other locations) 37.5 and 40 (other locations) as Regular Full-Time,"" and they've added remote workers into their own category as 'all other locations and remote' as ""regular part time,"" so it looks like there's the logic I was looking for.

So it seems maybe the 30+ hours might be dependent on other factors like location as well (in/out/away from ""home office"" location)."
I'm ok working the 40; I'm just trying to understand the logic. Full-time non-ADA in the office was 37.5; ADA WFH Full Time was still 37.5; now full time WFH goes to 40.
"My boss discussed it with me, as he is also now permanent WFH. He received the same email. So their does seem to be an intentional increase for folks permanent WFH; or a decrease to come into the office, depending on perspective. The latter makes a bit of sense, as another commenter suggested it might be more an incentive to return to office."
"Thanks; I appreciate your comment.

Now I just have to figure out the implications of being reclaimed from Regular Full Time to Regular Part Time; that feels very worrisome for some reason. 

Thanks for your input!"
"I did ask my boss; he also didn't know; as others have suggested, I'm not interested in rocking the boat by going to HR. Just trying to figure out the logic and thought folks here might know. Isn't this a sub where we ask other users questions about WFH issues -or do you just refer everyone back to their boss/HR."

"Just to follow up, a couple users helped me figure out it was due to job reclassification. Remote workers are now in Regular Part Time status instead of Regular Full Time."
"Actually, thanks for suggesting this! I was basing my original hours off my offer letter.

"Every job is different, especially remote/hybrid ones. Some are, ""Here are your goals, get them done!"". Others require you to be ""active"" for 8 hours a day (this is why there are mouse jigglers and other things to make you seem active).

Just because a job is remote/WFH, doesn't mean it is any less regimented than being in an office. You don't have the commute or the need to dress ""like an adult"" as perks but that's about the only known perks. 

On a side note, that last job sounds insane with the micromanagement."
"I had a micromanager for my remote job that I actually went back to my old job that is hybrid now.  It's very flexible in that I usually wfh if I have a doctor appointment, etc.  

Basically what I am saying it's boss dependent."
My current WFH job is similar to your old one. Available for core hours and just need to get my work done. I have a mouse jiggler from my previous job but haven't put it to use for this one (been here almost a year.) I can't imagine going back to a workplace where every hour of work is a scrutinized.
"My job is flexible when I have appointments that I can get the time off but we can't just make up the time and my job when in the office has to be specific hours, which I kept at home too just because they aren't bad when at home and gave me more sleep in the morning as when I started WFH I was undergoing cancer treatment. 

But I have to use time for anything that comes up. Whether in the office or WFH.  These jobs are very metrics based. Many of the jobs in my company are phone center based so it's pretty strict.  When at home I can choose my own lunch time and breaks unlike the office where I have to be very consistent so sometimes I can put a drive to pick up meds during lunch while WFH but that's about it.  

But I just report that I need time off to my supervisors or.  No one else has to know except when in the office as they have to cover my responsibilities but I don't go into details if it is FML or just time off.  

Now my family member who also WFH can get away with running to an appointment or an errand as long as they don't have a meeting scheduled.  But they can work after hours to finish a deadline and can do things over the weekend but they are salaried. Most of where I work are hourly so when our shift ends, it ends.  No working past our shift."
That is not exclusive to WFH all of that is possible in office too.
"There's often keywords that make it clear: ""distributed team"" is a very good one to look for.

I also ask the recruiter/first interviewer: ""What timezone is the bulk of the company's workforce located?"" Most remote companies are used to dealing with timezones and not locations, so the answer will often be telling.  ""Oh the founder and our main office is in Timbuctoo"" vs. ""Well the team is pretty diverse but is centered on <timezone>."" or ""We have people all over but we're a <country> centric company.""

My last one was answered roughly ""Well <incubator company> is located in <west coast city> but the founder is in <east coast state> and the developers are pretty evenly spread out.  We have a daily standup at <time timezone>."".

  

>Next job I find I am content woth, I am never leaving again

Double edged sword, the way to get ahead fiscally is job movement, but... as you noticed the grass may be greener only because it's over the septic tank!  I have specific needs fiscally and life balance wise (notably I care for a dementia parent and skilled care is $12,000 PER MONTH around me so... yeah I basically have to WFH) as long as the job meets those needs then I don't actually care about earning any more than that.  I mean I wouldn't turn it down, but I'm not leaving a good environment for an unknown or known toxic one just for more $$."
Yes - and I left for the wfh job because I loved the work I would be doing but then I was doing too much for nearly not enough pay once you worked it out and she wanted to know what I did all day.  So I was able to line up my old job cos they couldn't find someone to fill my spot apparently and went back like I never left for more money.  In the end it really worked out.
"...and I don't believe you. You made a big point of wanting more than 1.5 hours with your daughter before bed time. You want a part-time job because your priority is that time with your daughter. That's fine and your choice, but it is clearly not working full time.

Core hours of--for example--10a to 2p means you can work 5.30a to 2p and count on being able to work with someone who works 10a to 6.30p. It means someone working remotely up to three time zones away doesn't have a completely weird schedule. That's flexibility.

You said 1.5 hours with your daughter is not enough. So I arbitrarily picked 4 hours and took the extra 2.5 hours per day out of your work day. That means a work week of 27.5 hours. That is a part-time job, salaried or not. If you ""can get all your work done"" in that time then you already have a part-time job and you are over compensated. You should already be asking for more work.

WFH is not subsidized childcare.

The standard American full-time work week is 40 hours. If you are not consistently averaging 40 hours you aren't doing a good job, or you don't have enough to do then you should be asking for more (which leads to raises and promotions), or something else is fundamentally wrong and should be addressed.

You can at least be honest about what you want."
"Folks with uteruses should also consider that a WFH culture is beneficial.  I can usually work wherever I'm asked to (even during Shark Week), but on occasion, my uterus will wake up and choose violence.

On those days, I **can** work, but I'm a thousand times more effective if I'm not stuffing myself into nice pants and the bathroom is five steps away.  If I need to lie down, I can. If I need to put a hot pad on my abdomen, I can. If I want to wear ratty, comfy PJ pants, I can.

I spent almost 20 years taking multiple sick days off every few months for no other reason than I couldn't make it into the office for a stupid reason I couldn't control.  

 WFH is the great equalizer."
"I like telecommuting and glad it's there (even though I work in construction management so I don't get to do it often).

I just wanted to point out you are 100% wrong about the tolls.  If there are less cars paying tolls, the cost per car will go up.

As for the the Stinky Rides and Delays.... sort of the same thing.  The less people commute, the less trains/busses are provided so you still get the crowds and still get the delays (and from what I've seen it's actually worse than before the big WFH thing).

I'm very happy for those that can work from home and especially because once in a while I can too.  I think you may need to refine your argument a little though."
"Look how much better traffic was during covid. Look how much cleaner the skies were, multiply it out to realize how much infrastructure (roads, sewer, utilities etc) that we could save building (tax dollars) how much green space we could save by not expanding office parks etc.

WFH is a net positive for society."
I don't prefer remote work but I will always champion it because if someone doesnt want to be there they shouldn't have to.
"WFH will have a knock on effect on public housing design and prices as more houses are gonna have a need for additional room for office space. 

There will surely be some positive but also some negative effects on our psyche as we keep more and more enclosed and have less social interaction with other  people. 

Maybe it could all be solved by co-working spaces in your neighborhood"
"I don't care if people work from home or the office I just wish they would stop complaining about it non stop. Find another job if you want the other option. Otherwise be thankful you have a job, it's rough out there right now! (I'm hybrid right now and happy as can be)"
Been WFH for 13 years and I absolutely hate it. I would love to get in the office every day. I used to like it but I am single so I find it lonely and pretty boring. I'm all for the option I guess I wanted to share perspective on the longer term.
"""Less traffic"" is mostly false. For the same reason why adding more lanes of traffic will not eliminate traffic jams. https://youtube.com/shorts/a7g41jCoR9Y

Given time, traffic will always be as bad as people are willing to stand it. Obviously there are rare situations like dying cities.

Edit: ""less traffic"" is the main thing that I think is mostly false. And I am definitely pro WFH even if traffic wasn't a benefit."
what do you guys do for wfh?
"Plus if I am stuck in traffic during a commute knowing you're still asleep it's just going to anger me more. Sure won't be thinking ""this could be worse. Glad those WFH people are still asleep."""
"On a personal level, I love WFH.  But I feel like it has destroyed our ""ecosystem"".  People that don't need to be here for work are taking up housing and work that has to be done in person can't be filled because there is literally nowhere to live."
"That's a big problem that's not caused by remote work. Here's what causes it. When a company reluctantly embraces it because it needs people, that reluctant actitude will influence decisions regarding the career of remote workers. Ambivalent companies towards remote work will always treat remote workers in an ambivalent way, which might hurt their careers and make them feel they're on borrowed time.
This is a case for companies to get more supportive of remote workers, not for going back to the office so you get more money that will pay for your commute."
"Is there a chance that, if you ever go back to office life for 6 months, you realize how awful offices have become today, and you regret not sticking to WFH?"
"It's the same principal. Imagine a city of 20,000 people with distant suburbs of 40,000 people. None of the suburb people commute because traffic is too bad -- the roads can only handle 20,000 people, if they drive, it's 20,001 people. Now imagine 10,000 city dwellers start WFH (and stay in the city for simplicity sake), traffic doesn't get halved. Why? Because a bunch of the suburb people decide that traffic isn't so bad and downtown jobs pay better. After enough time, you end up with 10,000 suburb people commuting into the city. The remainder of the suburb people don't want to commute because traffic is beyond their threshold of discomfort.

It's a simplistic example but so is the idea that ""WFH will always reduce traffic""."
"I wish everyone who wanted to work from home could do so.  But it is disingenuous to act like, in a society build where housing mirrors job opportunities, that it hasn't had a massive impact to the housing shortage."
I'm not arguing against WFH at all. There are definitely a lot of benefits.
"Each company is different.  I had 10 weeks of training before I was released to WFH.  I also work in the federal Government where they do allow for reasonable accommodation.  It wouldn't hurt to ask along with some kind of supporting documentation from your doctor.  

I was sick for a week during training and they allowed me to conference call in that week and do the training at home."
"My job requires in office training before people wfh.  We do make that very clear on our job postings and when we interview people. 

The in office training is usually 6 months, but could be more or less depending on the persons experience and ability to learn the work processes. We only have one office location though so there isn't an issue with travel. 

We used to allow remote employees to do their training at home since we could easily screen share with them to do training, but we had higher rates of turnover. Many people who left said they didn't feel like they got to know the team well enough at home to be comfortable asking questions and they felt left out at times. Once we switched to training in person we haven't had anyone leave, other than promotions to better roles within the company that we need to backfill."
I had to get through 3 months of being in the office before getting any WFH days. Try to deal with it for now!
Many companies require you put in significant in person work before allowing fully remote or hybrid. They just don't tell you that. My BFF is finishing a year of on site before being able to wfh.
I got a job like that and they never let me move to WFH. Good luck and I hope it works for you.
"I switched career fields after 21 years, and went from 100% remote to a hybrid role (1/2 day in office Monday morning, WFH the other 36 hours).
I had to go into the office (1.36 miles from my house) for 2 weeks. It was utterly exhausting having to put on real pants and 'people', but it was totally worth it. I love my new job, and the people I work with.
That being said, I think it would be fine to ask your supervisor for an ETA on when you will have access so you can work remote, and if it's an extended (or unknown) timeframe, ask if you can work solely at the office closest to your home due to your medical situation."
"I took a remote job and spent the first two months training onsite.  I was ready for remote after a month.  I would ask constantly.  And found out we were waiting on our IT lady dragging her feet to get my equipment.  She was getting annoyed of me but i kept on it.  Then...they hired someone who previously worked there and they gave him remote access after a week.  I spoke up again and told them i have monitors at home(that was their reasoning to give him remote work so fast, basically me suffered for months over a couple cheap monitors).  Next day, low and behold, magically got my wfh equipment and have only been in the office maybe 3 times since"
"Congrats friend!!! WFH is tough to find Joe a days, consider that lucky.

I wouldn't bat an eye, OC they want you in office for training. Your home tree after that friend"
Can you bring your IVF medication with you? Pull off the highway well before it's time to take it even if you have to wait at a stop for awhile until the right time. Will it slow down your trip home? Yes. Will it keep you on your IVF schedule so you have peace of mind? Yes. Will you get to WFH eventually? Yes.
"When I was hired by a large corporation (years and years ago) the deal was I would be able to work out of my own home in order to cover a remote territory. It wasn't a work from home position per se, but my home was intended to be my virtual office. However in order to be brought up to speed on the companies processes and culture and to get proper training I had to be in the regional office 3 days a week for several months - and that office was two hours away. I split my transportation between driving and taking the bus or train (depending on schedule).  


I worked for that company for 18 years and the pay allowed my spouse to stay home and raise our kids, so overall well worth the initial aggravation at the beginning.  


Would it be possible to come change your commute times to reduce the traffic? Come in early and leave early?   


My thought on asking about when - focus on getting access to the remote EMR. Then you have the tools you need to ask for the release to work from home..."
"I will throw this out there in case it's helpful: I got an accommodation to access remote work immediately when I moved into my current role. I did it to secure my ability to work remotely regardless of policy changes and to get past the 90 day probationary period, so depending on the environment and what kind of support you have from your employer and healthcare provider, you could consider this route if other attempts at clarifying what timeframe you are looking at to continue in office aren't working."
"I work in a similar healthcare field and it's EPIC access that takes a long time to get set up for us, you probably just need to suck it up until you get access, as in our case it's IT that gives us access and between online training modules and waiting on IT it takes about a month to gain access, then staff can go remote.  The good news is once you get access you'll be wfh ready and it'll be behind you.  Hang in there and best of luck with the pregnancy!

ETA: I don't think it's snarky to ask for the status of your EMR access most reasonable people shouldn't either.  If it's taken that way when asked it's a red flag IMO"
"You might see if you can only work from the site nearest your home until you are able to begin the wfh part. At least that minimizes your commute. 
Explain you are trying to do your best to accommodate their needs but also preserve your energy during your pregnancy. 
Good luck OP"
"Consider two options to remove traffic for the equation in the morning or evening. Work from home for first two hours, then go in and work rest of the day. You'll hit traffic end of day but at least u skip traffic in the morning. Try the opposite, as well. See what u like. Talk to ur boss about your plan to do either one. I do this and love it."
"Sounds like you have a very similar job to mine but they were up front with me about the required in office period before I could work from home. Did they not tell you that while interviewing? They definitely should have. Unfortunately the ball is in their court right now, I would be professional and polite and just ask what the timeline is, at least you won't be left guessing. I know it must suck but if you can try and stick it out, these kinds of jobs are highly coveted and if you quit it puts you right back in a competitive market."
"I hope it works out for you! I was full time in office with a 30 minute one way commute and went through IVF 3 times and the final time successfully pregnant with triplets which required 8 weeks of bed rest right after my busy season where I had to work overtime (desk job though). This was when zero work from home was a thing. I ate up my full FMLA 12 weeks of leave between bed rest at home and then 5 weeks of NICU time where I stayed at the Ronald McDonald house because the hospital was an hour from home. When they were dismissed from NICU my work let me burn all my vacation time and then work 3 days a week for one month after that so that when my infants were effectively at gestation I was back at work full time. This was 11 years ago also before any paternity leave. I say all this to NOT say - I did it, so can you - I say this to say I AM SO VERY JEALOUS of the options everyone has these days. It's awesome. I got so robbed but my kids are all 3 healthy with no delays/impacts from early delivery... and I have a pension and retirement from working through it so whatevs. I'm just so jealous of what could have been an absolute night and day experience for my family fast forwarding to now when I worked from home (same company) 2 years through COVID. Sigh. Good luck! I hope all works out well."
"Every time I've had to do in house training I always had the estimated training time cut short because I was comfortable doing everything. 

Go in, try your best, show you are capable and then ask if they mind if you just work from home after a day of asking for no assistance. Maybe you will only have to do a few days in office."
"I started my current job as an operator for a network of hospitals. When I started the job it was in the middle of covid. They had just started WFH, and it took me 6 months to get WFH status. Now the majority of my team works from home.

But since then I have been promoted to resource coordinator. Which means now I am sort of a backup operator who gets calls when the other operator lines are busy. But I also take calls for Women's Services & Physician Referral's. I also handle coordination & scheduling for Maternity & Senior Classes offered by the hospitals.

Hopefully this company works out for you OP if not, you might keep filling out applications and can find something better."
"100%. This is stressful and annoying, but it is going to be way more important imo to wfh when pregnant and after maternity leave. I think it's a worthwhile short term investment. Not to say you shouldn't still push your manager, but bailing now (or becoming an employee they don't feel is invested enough) isn't going to help anything."
Thank you so much! Definitely a good idea to use the weather as a transition into the WFH convo
"Ah! I kinda fear this, but I have a lot of written documentation that clearly states work from home 4 days a week...so hopefully won't be an issue."
"Yep. At my husband's company they give one WFH day per year of service, up to four. 

You said it best, OP - suck it up. 

And congrats on your pregnancy! "
"Don't say about the weather, otherwise the boss will think you are making excuses already for not wanting to come to the office. In North America people have to go to the office even though there is a snow/ ice storm. Thus it is not a good reason to let you WFH earlier than expected."
"Thank you, that is a fair point. I haven't mentioned it or hinted that I'm itching to work from home yet because I want to act professionally."
"Im diabetic, wfh but also visit clients locally. I get that traffic those days. If timing is important, pull over and inject. I do it as needed. Typically have to stop to pee at least once for anything over 45 mins.  The hybrid schedule  is worth this initial small temporary inconvenience IMO.  I've visited 3 accounts locally,  1 hr visits and yet spent 12hrs from start to finish in ATL traffic.  You got this!"
Lack of commute is the BEST thing about WFH.
"I started my current job as full WFH, then got switched to another team, where I'd need to come in once a week. While the requirement was verrrry loose, it wasn't abused, and if you just simply weren't feeling well, my current director didn't mind. 
Up until now though, on our in-office days, we've had our own single day we'd come in, with other teams coming in on different days of the week. Historically, the joke is that no one gets shit done on their day in the office, because everyone likes talking to each other. We did get enough done on the rest of the week to make up for it, so it wasn't all that bad - plus, it was nice to see people occasionally. 

However, they made the announcement a few weeks ago that we'd be going, in full, 4 days a week, with 1 at home. I mean, at that point, why not just say full RTO? Now, all teams will be in the office, with nearly everyone having to travel anywhere between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours one way to work - my own travel time being a solid hour and 57 miles one way. Productivity has already dropped, and next, it's going to be the valuable talent that keeps the ball rolling. I mean ffs, it's goddamn software development. Why in the hell do I even need to go in at all? Haven't I been doing well remotely? I feel like I'm being punished for my efforts, and it's absolutely taken the wind out of my sails. 

What was once a place I was excited to work for every morning, has now turned into just another job where I need to shackle myself to a desk to do the same fucking thing I was doing in the comfort and quiet of my own home. I get so much more done at home, in so much less time. Half my day is already eaten by meetings, and now this? As much as I don't want to, because it feels like I'm betraying my team members - it's time to start refreshing that resume."
"The only plus side of Covid, for me is remote work. I work for the state as a disability examiner. When people apply all the applications get sent to the agency where I work and I process the cases and make decisions. Before Covid we were told we can't work remotely. Because we work with sensitive information. We do everything electronically. And when I print stuff out that needs to be mailed it prints to the mail room and there is a machine that folds and stuffs all the envelopes so my office assistant doesn't have to mail anything either and they were allowed to do remote work either. 

Then after Covid they finally found a way to make wfh possible. And we wfh for 2 years. My boss told me I've been much more productive at home and so have a lot of other people. Then they wanted us to RTO. A lot of people quit. Others quit later once they lined up a job. They had a hard time hiring because no one was applying since people are looking for wfh. And a new hire is considered a trainee for a year and it really takes 2-3 years to become proficient. Those who are hired never last a year. Since we are so understaffed all examiners are getting more cases/work and they have a hard time with the caseload since they are new. 

So reluctantly they started added wfh days. They had to keep increasing it and now I only have to go in once a month! It is performance based though. I only know of a few others that only have to go in once a month. So a lot of the other examiners are upset they have to come in 2-5 days a week. 

I love that my boss doesn't micromanage which makes wfh better. I don't have to listen to one coworker who spends his entire work day just talking all day. He isn't allowed any wfh days and it's hardly surprising. He is so distracting. It's also hot and humid af at the office. The building used to be a warehouse and it was converted to a bunch of offices with cubicles. I like being at home at a nice cool temperature. 

It's also so nice I can go make my lunch when I take my lunch break. I usually get my breakfast started while my computer is loading up and while I check my emails and voicemails. I don't have a commute. I save on gas and maintenance on my car. I get more sleep since I don't have to wake up early. 

I don't ever want to go back in office 5 days a week."
"I love WFH. I've never had a job that I was busy 8-5, so when I was done with my work, i'd mindlessly walk around office, talk to friends, scroll on my phone, pretend to look busy.

Now when I have some free time, I do stuff around the house, go for walks, run a quick errand. I'm a mom of 2, so I can maximize my time. Dinner is ready at 5.

I think wfh and hybrid should be the norm."
"Okay I love this for you and anyone else that has this WTH experience! :)   
I've never worked from home, although currently looking to, and I KNOW I'll be better off. Especially mentally. The getting ready, commuting, dealing with people in and outside of work, communicating endlessly, masking all day and every work day, to go home to deal with more adulting tasks, made me sick and tired of being sick and tired of life. I'm extremely anxious to have to go back to work (if the work isn't remote). I'll deal with it and adapt because that's what I do, but will I be mentally unstable from it? Most likely. Probably. Yep.   


Work-life balance was never really a thing. I'd be too physically and mentally exhausted to do stuff on days off. And these were part time jobs (due to a few circumstances). I don't think I would have survived if it were full time. And some of the jobs were literally for experience I was trying to gain. The pay wasn't great and if I didn't have food from home prepped (another stress), then most my 'wages' went on lunch. And let's not talk about travel expenses. I felt like I was working for nothing. But I was willing because I needed the experience (whatever that ended up being).   


So when I hear people living their best lives with WFH jobs I'm like YASSSS LIVE ITTTTTT. And it gives me some sort of hope for myself. But also can you please enjoy every snack and coffee on my behalf? Pls tnx bye."
"It is also the best thing that has ever happened to me. All of our competitors work from home and don't even have a physical center, never did. We're the only ones with a center, and if other people want to work there because they don't like working from home or because they're not set up for it, that's great for them. I love working from home. It's the most peaceful part of my job."
Sadly all I see is RTO no more WFH
"Some of you need to eat a snickers all in your feelings. It's reality, they are already eliminating WFH jobs"
"I enjoy my job but going into the office made if feel like a chore, now im wfh 4 days a week and  I love it! No more Sunday night dread"
"> pretend to look busy. 

That's just it, people who argue against WFH think that only people at home slack off. Unless you're in a call center that focuses on incoming calls where you have zero control of your time, EVERYONE pretends to look busy at some point or another. The difference is being productive at home vs useless activities at work. 

I too love that I can get stuff done around the house in my free time."
"I feel you! My last non-WFH job was running a rehab in Florida. I worked 72 hours a week (salaried so no OT), and overnights. So I got Saturday night off to myself but I just stayed up all night because I'd have to be at work again Sunday night. Bless my now wife for dealing with it for almost 2 years. I first met her during that schedule and it made everything difficult. Date nights, traveling. Anything at all because it was really just one free day a week. 

Now.. I have free time for everything. WFH positions can definitely vary. Although my first WFH was more strict I could still do some tasks on my lunch break. At the very least I could still do a couple of loads of laundry. 

With this one I am 100% in control of my time. Sure, I'm supposed to be available for phones, but I can just change my status to away and be gone for 20 minutes and no one says anything. Since it's a sales job, my results reflect in my efforts. So I work hard and sell well.. but also am very lax. I almost never have adult/home chores after work. Mostly because I wake up a couple hours before I start at 9 and don't have to dedicate that time to a commute/getting ready/packing food. But I can do laundry throughout the day, mow on my lunch break if needed, run to the dump up the street for trash. Even schedule early morning appointments. You wouldn't think the difference between 8am and 9am would be so drastic but it is. 

I also work til 5. With an hour lunch break. So technically I only work 35 hours a week. My boss has a weekly goal/incentive for us that if we sell 5k or more in a week's period, we get a half day of our choosing. I almost always hit my goal, so on those weeks I'm only working 32 hours. 

The caveat is that the pay is only meh. I have a 32k base salary, and the commission structure is pretty shit so even though I'm top ten in my territory I might only make an extra 8k a year. 

Unfortunately.. that means I need more money. So I'm going back to school for accounting with the hopes that it'll be a good salary and eventually be working from home again even though I know I won't be in the beginning. But honestly WFH is the best thing for me. It's been great for my wife and I, and I hope it gains more popularity down the road as the greybeards and boomers retire."
Stop with the fear mongering negativity. Remote work has existed before the pandemic and will ALWAYS be available in many industries. Sorry that upsets you.
Who is they?  Your employer?  Mine certainly isn't. I've been WFH for over a decade.
"Ooh, I need to switch my insurance company.  

I have a ten year clean record AND WFH and they're cranking my rates by 30%.

What company did you go with?"
"It did exist, but not nearly as much as it does now. I 100% don't agree that people should be forced back into the office but RTO just seems to be the new wave unfortunately. My job is remote and my manager said recently that a *manager in a different department* is trying to make my team RTO due to a simple task that comes up once every couple weeks, that her team can handle easily but she feels is beneath them. 

It's like those that have to be in office are now just trying to find ways to make everyone RTO out of spite and I hate it. 

My job is very stressful and the biggest perk (and reason I stay) is WFH. If I have to RTO, I'll find another job that is much less stressful and pays the same."
"Treat WFH as if you were in the office. Have a set start time and a set end time. You want to be visible to others on your team as much as possible. Constantly have updates on your group chats (slack, Teams, etc) and get to know your coworkers, even if it's a small ping just for small talk. Whatever you do: do not appear to be disengaged. That will put an unintentional target on your back and make you look bad to management"
"I agree with having a set start and end time. This is to show you are available during ""normal"" business hours. I tend to log into Teams slightly earlier because I have a clear mind in the morning to get important tasks out of the way.

I think over communication is not necessary but definitely observe and learn what is consider ""normal"" with your new coworkers.

As for the don't appear ""disengaged"", just be yourself and be the expert of what you DO. Admit your mistakes and own them. And when you do not know the answer to a request, admit you don't know and don't make shit up.

There are time you absolutely need to stand your ground and draw a line in the sand. Even WFH doesn't mean you should get shit on and take the fall of someone's dumb decision or mistake."
"My main tip is invest in your home office/work setup.  Get your company to pay for whatever you can, but get yourself a nice set up.  Appreciate the beauty of having complete control over your physical work environment.  

I also think the advice to ""get ready"" to WFH is good advice.  That doesn't have to mean wearing slacks, but at least putting on daytime sweatpants is wise.  

If you can swing it, a home office )that you only work in and can leave/close the door when you're offline) is ideal."
"Adjusting to WFH when you're used to leaving the house five days a week is very different. A lot of people including myself go through a phase of depression. Make friends at work so you have people to reach out to. Something else I've learned is PLEASE don't be afraid to ask as many questions as possible. Working from home is an art and you paint it however it best fits you. Just try not to fall into unhealthy habits or things that can cause you to be unproductive/unmotivated. If you're a coffee/tea drinker, have that comfort cup handy. Separate your work from your personal as much as possible. I spent six months with my monitors in my room and went mad. I couldn't just sit in my room without my eyes shifting to my desk and BOOM.. work. Now I have an ""office."" Sometimes I jokingly tell my SO that I'm home from work as I walk out of my closet office. 

A lot of companies have programs that help with virtual career development. Even if you're fluent in the face to face world of things, virtual really is a totally different ball game. If that option isn't available, YouTube is a great resource. If that doesn't work for you--of course you have this SubReddit. 

Working from home is absolutely amazing in my opinion! I hope you love it as much as I do!!
If you took the time, I apologize. I'm stoned lol. 

I wish you all the best "
My company went to WFH after COVID. It was a disaster. People who have always worked in an office then suddenly start working from home got lazy. We lost our 2 biggest customers because of this. Working in an office instills on time performance and better communication with others. I'm not saying WFH is bad. I did it for 40 years but I worked on the road. When the people I worked with started WFH everything went downhill.
"I would second this, for the first month or so, until you can read your team. I don't mind having a report keeping me updated on what they are doing, and for the first bit, I am going to try and make sure that they are doing what needs to be done, but if I have someone WFH, I don't have time to hover over them at every step of the way. 

If I tell you I need you to do: X, Y, and Z, I need X by Tuesday, Y by Thursday, and Z is floating, but expect to be able to get back to the department head around the middle of December, just work on it in your downtime. I don't need a live update. When you are up to speed, I'm anticipating that will be all that is talked about unless you have a problem or you get done with the assignment. If I felt like I was going to need to hand-hold a role, I wouldn't let it be WFH. My best-performing person sends me status reports that are awesome, on Monday mornings and at the end of every day she emails a briefing that is excellent. She is prior military and I get this email that is like

...Everything she has done this month. 


Big deal - When she has an annual review, she brings the receipts... I GET A PDF THAT IS EVERY OUNCE OF HER REPORTING ABILITY.  It makes my life so much easier when I go to a review committee. I hand them the PDF and basically say, shut up and pay the woman. I started working on a monthly log that is about 50% as good and now that I have been making resumes, it's so much easier to do when you have a log of what you did and when. I highly recommended it."
The wfh depression is real.
This. Most wfh establishments are far more productive than in office environments. It saves companies millions in a variety of ways and emotional vampires in the workplace are no longer a cultural albatross.
"If you're actually working, I mean really working hard the whole time, not reddits inferior mentality of ""working"", then you won't need to do anything else.  It will be self evident.  There will be systems of some kind monitoring your remote laptop, whether it records video, audio, tickets being changed, google activity or sleep or cpu states, pc load, etc.  It's trivial to see if you're actually doing work or not as a remote worker.

Pretty much all the problems that exist in corporate life are self imposed because no one wants to work, managers especially don't want to work.  That's why they hide in meetings all day and syncs, status updates, planning sessions, focus groups, etc.  You don't actually need that BS to manage people effectively and good front-line management isn't a full time job.

So basically, just do your job well.  Get your work done.  Work hard.  Take on a little extra if the company treats you well or pays you properly.  It's not that hard or complicated.  But if you abuse WFH to not do work, to slack and force your teammates to pick up your slack, well, you won't make it and you will ruin it for everyone else."
No manager would employ remote workers and then foster an always appear to  be available culture like that. Reeks of insecurity
"My colleagues are WFH with travel, because they are sales people.  They have home offices, but are required to visit customers and job sites, hence the 'travel' portion of their job.

This would need to be clarified for the role you're interested in

When I first applied for my job it was 100% clear that I would be full time WFH, no travel at all.  I've been remote since 2018, no possibility of that changing"
"I'm a Remote employee but I work in Sales so travel is also required. 

I'm flying to Seattle next week to meet customers but I work from home 90% of the time."
"It depends on the position you can have 100%,99%, 50% anywhere from being in the office once a year to wfh one day a week. I WFH 99% of the time, but sometimes I have to go into the office, but I do IT and thats usually when something breaks. So travel is required, but its variable, and makes sense for my position."
Always. Understand that this is how remote work started. Territory sales manager with a retail network? You're remote and on the road 100% friend.
"From my understanding, it all depends where your home base is, but saying ""remote"" for people who travel is correct. Let's say you travel for work 30% of the time and then when you're done traveling you work from home remotely, you're technically a Remote worker because you don't have a physical place you report back to and work out of. 
But usually job posting will state in the job description how much traveling is required."
"I'm noticing some positions for the role I'm in require travel to meet with clients, but not necessarily to home offices of the employer. 

Alternatively, I've also noticed ""remote first"" companies that require travel once a quarter or so to a home office for ""collaboration."" 

Both are a no for me."
"Hell yes!!! I'm sick and tired of jackass companies wanting remote workers to schlep our laptops around  the country "" up to 50%"" of the time.
Heads up, job posters.
That's called field sales."
"""Remote doesn't mean work from home; it means work from a satellite location away from our ceo home-city office""

Yeah that applies to EVERY company that has a home office in another city... what a BS answer....

I report these immediately .... they're using ""remote"" to bait and switch to acquire a pool of applicants...."
"IMO it depends on the role, the company, and other factors. When I went WFH in my most recent role, I still had to visit the office (a few hours drive) occasionally for team gatherings, strategy planning, and similar. Also I supported external clients, and had to travel to their office occasionally for business reviews and similar discussions. In both of these cases my employer treated it as business travel so I was compensated for mileage, meals, airfare for the client visits, and hotel. 

As things are looking now with the ""me too, those other companies are doing it so we should too"" approach to forcing employees to RTO without any actual benefit, I guess it's less likely I'll find another similar situation. But to the OP's question, it's probably not reasonable in any kind of professional position to ""never"" visit an office, so by definition that may require some travel. Ideally it's limited though."
"If you would have asked me what a ""remote"" job was 5 years ago, I would have told you it's a job where you are frequently traveling away from your main office and will not be home every night, sometimes for weeks.

""Work From Home"" and ""Remote"" were two different things."
"For me, my WFH requires quite a bit of local travel. But it is great, for me. I completely understand someone this setup wouldn't work for though, I do have exposure issues, have to be around humans, but the risk is worth it for me. I love the job, love to drive, I have no commute since I WFH, so I start from home at 8 and end at home at 6:30 ( 4 10s schedule), love that the job has set it up so we have an extremely generous PTO allowance. In between service calls when all work related work is done, I am expected to be home. I am home for parts of each day, sometimes for 10 min and sometimes for 6 hours.

All of this to say, some WFH jobs that require travel are great jobs."
"My position is officially 100% WFH, but I was required to be in-office twice last year, for 2-3 days both times.

They would have paid for travel and lodging if I lived hours away, but I don't.

They still consider me fully remote, and I'm honestly not mad.

Oh, I also had two conferences last year I had to travel to, but that would have been necessary travel even if I were on-site full time. Technically the conferences were optional, but it would have been foolish not to go. I don't travel well and took vacation days after to recover."
"The job market sucks and companies put remote in the posting not knowing what that means.

Most companies had bad experiences with remote working during covid.

I worked for a remote first company that was doing great. They had no offices, did everything online and didn't care where you were. No questions asked.

For more than a year I'm looking for something similar but it doesn't exist anymore. At least not in sales where I'm in.

And btw, I invoice, so they just need to pay my invoice. No legal stuff involved for the employer."
"Exactly. What we are seeing is:
1) Companies that were always remote that required travel
2) Companies that previously had a home office but also required travel (to clients, etc) that pivoted to being completely remote, with travel still required. 

And maybe less so (hopefully) 3) Companies that are actually hybrid, but are pretending to be remote only with frequent travel required into one office."
It's hard to find WFH without some catches like those now
"Yup, all of this is true. Bottom line: When I see remote I have to remind myself that remote work is not always work from home"
"The $5k pay bump is not even close to enough to make that commute 3 times per week.

I would continue to WFH until you find a job that is at a minimum $10-20k more than your current salary and still fully remote. But that's just what I would do, everyone has different needs."
"this isn't the place to go for an unbiased opinion on the matter lol. very few people here are willing to trade wfh for anything. 

i'm not as militant and i consider wfh to have some downsides, but i'd still find it very hard to do a commute of that length of time plus the public transit factor would be a deal breaker. i'd be concerned the hybrid could become full time. stagnant is definitely not where you want to be but it doesn't have to be one or the other- see if they'll negotiate and if not keep looking for something that helps you grow but keep wfh or at least less days in office/less commute time."
"I would say for just $5k keep the WFH. 3 days could become more faster than you know it. With your added expenses needing a car, maybe dog care for an aging dog, it doesn't math unless this position will seriously help you advance in your career in a way that your current job cannot, and even then, $5k is not much when you factor in all that time commuting, getting ready, being tired and not wanting to cook, etc.

I left a fully wfh no chance of going back role for a $13k raise and big promotion and hybrid one day in office in September, by January one days became two and who knows how many more in the future. I wouldn't have taken it for two days in office."
"I would personally stay WFH, but that's me. The economy will rebound again, and there will be opportunities down the road for advancement. That's not enough compensation for a 45 min commute, imo. You may feel differently, though."
Ahhh the dreaded choice between having an actual career or just being a commodity in the 100% WFH cog
Is wfh negotiable - maybe once a week?
"And a job that you can WFH isn't a career?  That's silly.  A career defines what you do for a living.  Where you do that is irrelevant.  Write software for a living, that's a career, even if you WFH.  And companies didn't care before and they don't care now.  You are a resource, that's all."
i'm aware of overemployed but don't see how that would work for ops jobs. how's she gonna do a second job when she's in the office 3 days a week? most people get two full time wfh jobs with at least one requiring hardly any effort.
A 100% WFH job and you are in your 20s or 30s is definitely not going to be a career... that's just reality... sorry.
That's not true at all. I'm in a tech based job that's very much a career job and is WFH
"As a remote worker, if I get called in during the day, I charge for my commute. Guess what: They don't call me in as much anymore.

What kind of a university messes up payroll? That is worrisome. But I bet they have a whole payroll department you can talk to. 

I'd leave this job as soon as I could. Good luck!"
"My last 2 wfh jobs have been over 1,000 miles from me. My current one, my team is scattered all over the country. Thankfully there is no way to RTO because they would have to pick a location. The office is in Silicon Valley and no one wants to RTO there. It's too expensive & they would have to double or triple our pay. This is the way."
It sounds like she resents you for being able to work from home. She is probably a busybody and is looking for any excuse to have everyone back in the office. You should probably look for another work from home job. This obviously is not working out. You should not be this stressed.
If you are a wfh employee and you are called to a different location they need to pay your expenses. Put in mileage claims and ensure you travel on company time. You can claim whenever your place of work is other than home.
"When they ask you to drive in, send them the job description that explains you were hired for remote work. Fuck a 6 hour round trip drive for some bullshit meeting."
"HR here- what does your onboarding paperwork say in terms of location? Did you sign a remote work policy? If you were hired as remote, your paperwork should say your location, and/or remote on it. 

Some policies will conveniently write something along the lines of ""remote work is a privilege and can be revoked at any time"". Now, unless they gave you something in writing that says ""remote work is revoked effective XXX"" you are entitled to work under the agreements you signed."
please fill this if you WFH https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeRbVcYEKcowV0dYQZ_3X9-4QSJZHsPMwnxRN6ixtA--xkiA/viewform
"Please read your employee handbook. It should state the travel policy.

If you were hired as a WFH employee, travel into the office for training or meetings should be covered by mileage reimbursement.  If you are an hourly employee Travel time is also considered work time and you are paid for it.

If you typically start at 8am, you start driving at 8am.  If you start driving earlier that's extra pay, same for commute home.

Also check in with employee relations/HR"
I'm looking for a job WFH and I am specifically avoiding any WFH jobs in my state so that being called into the office is incredibly unlikely and I'm not willing to do it even if they pay for travel. I no longer work in dusty fabric covered boxes in endless rows of sunless rooms at every corporation in the nation. Now I work from home and I get twice as much work done so employers shouldn't bitch about it. They hire me to do my work not be in the office so I can help everyone else.
"I'm not sure if this is true. I think it only applies if you are going to a client location, or, like, 3rd party - not from home office to work office. I could be wrong, but definitely don't rely on this being true without checking."
">I think it only applies if you are going to a client location, or, like, 3rd party - not from home office to work office.

It depends on your contract and your company's policies"
"OP said they were told they could WFH ""in an email."" So, not sure if they have a contract that states they are a remote employee.

I also don't know whether universities are any different, but one company I worked for that went remote had a policy that employees could move wherever they wanted within their country, but could be required to travel to one of the office hubs a few times per year at their own expense. This was essentially the trade-off to having salaries adjusted based on COL. You can keep your big city salary and move wherever, but you'll have to pay for your own travel for any in-person company events."
"Have you managed people?  If you have you know what a total PIA it is to be copied on every email and get a daily task update.  You ONLY do this when things have slipped through the cracks/been done incorrectly.

OP refers to them as menial my hunch is they are tasks they don't like doing but are critical for the role.  The manager asked for this to observe them to try to figure out what the issue is and how to best resolve.  Are they unclear on the ask or on the process?  If not then are they intentionally just not doing the work?  Asking someone to come in 1 day a week while training, especially when the manager is apparently giving them flexibility and not even requiring them to be there for 8 hours during the day isn't harassment.  It's a manager trying to work with an underperforming new hire.

I was curious so I looked at their post history.  They've been given feedback about their performance that they've dismissed, and they took a pay cut to leave their last fully remote job for this one.   You only do that when the writing is on the wall that you're about to be out of a job.

I love WFH and I want to ensure it continues to be a thing for those who are capable of delivery results in a remote environment.  I don't think OP is helping that cause."
"God I hate this whole attitude I see on here about ""you're going to ruin WFH for all of us!""

Managers and companies that want to be remote will stay remote and see underperforming employees as such.

Managers and companies that think in-person work is more effective, or just want asses in chairs will demand that, regardless of how efficient employees are, either remote or in-person.

I have been working at remote or partially-remote companies for 8 years. I've never once witnessed underperformance blamed on someone being remote. Remote companies don't care that someone might be underperforming because they want/need people who can work well remotely. So, an under-performer is seen as just that, and they get let go. They are not a good fit.

Even at mostly in-office companies I've worked at that allow flex remote work,  if someone is underperforming when they are remote -- clearly slacking off and less available, they are simply let go for it.

On the other hand, managers who believe in-person work is more effective are always going to feel that way in my experience. Doesn't matter how well you do with remote work. Usually it's the manager who doesn't work with a remote-first model, so they will sabotage remote workers by refusing to utilize digital tools.

Edit: I looked at OP's post history and something is weird. 

They created a post 4 months ago discussing the same exact scenario, except in the last one, the boss was male and OP's commute was 3.5 hours instead of just 3. Also, somewhere they say they are a Software Engineer, but in the last role they were a Business Analyst. I know there can be crossover in these roles, it just seems a bit odd that four months ago they were also ""new"" to a role where a different boss was having them drive 3.5 hours into the office for training."
"Scam, i wfh i brought this up to my boss and its a huge scam. Check out the reviews"
Nothing you get from your work should require you to send anything financially related to anyone.yoyr work should procure and provide any equipment you may need. A laptop should arrive in the mail and be preloaded with all the applications and security software you may need. No company will have a new employee pick out their laptop and home office equipment. Scam af.
"This is a scam. Companies don't do equipment for remote workers this way.  Just stop communicating with them and then block.

Don't explain, don't ask questions of them, just block. They are trying to steal your money."
"Okay I see a lot people saying this is a scam. Just sharing my experience. A year ago I started working for my company and I was hired virtually and worked remotely right from the beginning. This is a very well known company and reputable. I was sent a laptop by them, BUT. I was also sent a deposit into my account to buy necessary WFH equipment. (monitor, keyboard, mouse, desk etc.) This stipend did not come with any conditions and did not require that I submit proof of purchase or anything. This does sound a little like a scam but also trying to give you hope that there are some legit jobs that do things like this."
"Sounds like a scam to me. I had a WFH job that sent me my electronics, then told me to select pens, paper, etc from Staples, note the item #, and they would mail those to me."
That is huge red flag ... Every company that I hire remote workers for will send equipment or have a vms/ VPN setup ... If you get that check call the issuing bank check to make sure it's not fraudulent before depositing and purchasing anything!
scam!! i work for a smaller company and i even had a new laptop shipped to me in hawaii when i was working remotely on a long vacation lol like they would have NEVER charged me for that. absolutely not.
"Do.
Not.
Send.
A.
Cheque.
In.
The.
Mail.
It's very much a way to scam ppl. I know many people who WFH & they all had their company send them the equipment for the job directly to their home and never paid for it, that is how a legitimate company does it."
"WFH gigs send you all required equipment, and you never have to pay for anything out of pocket."
"No, I haven't had to use my own equipment since 2000 when we were all desktop computers and telecommuting was still very rare. That was a pain but since I was in the office 3-4 days a week, manageable.

I've had a company provided laptop for well over a decade and been FT WFH for nearly as long. The laptop came with a docking port and a monitor from when I was still in an office six or seven years ago that I use as a second screen when we went WFH. The other day my house had a power failure and the docking port went kaput, meaning no more second screen. I was sent a link to order a replacement for the docking port and was shocked to see what else I could order. After seeing my approved shopping list I only wish I had enough space on my desk to order the really good monitor."
"Absolutely not in this case. Even in a wfh job a virtual interview on camera with a hiring manager is expected. And no, you should not be required to purchase your own equipment even if reimbursement is promised."
"When you interviewed for this place, did you have a phone interview or did you have an in person or zoom interview? Did you look up this company on glassdoor, indeed, or even just a quick Google search? I had a coworker who got an amazing opportunity that was remote, $70,000 a year And it turned out to be a total scam and they took like $5000 from him. I would not send anything until you find out if this is a legit company or not.


If this is a legit company and you know this is a legit company, I would ask if you could give the checks in person if possible. If that's not an option, I'd still be kind of weary of working for a company that I can't even go to their homebase, because what if there's an issue with your checks? what if something needs to be addressed quickly and in person, where are you going to go? Remote work is nice but you Gotta be really careful."
"That's scammed from home not work from home.

No WFH will make you pay for anything more than a background check."
"This is a scam. 

Been a remote worker for 8+ years. All employers send you laptops by mail. Any supplies you have to buy would be through a company portal (after you get your login). It will be paid directly through the company account. No one will offer you a job without doing a video call."
"Scam-a-lam-a-ding-ding!!!

Real WFH employers send you a laptop or make you use your own PC to connect to a virtual PC they set up.  It's usually a secure website to make the connection.

No one ever sends you a check or makes you send them a check."
"Fyi this screams scam. All my work from home jobs (I have had 3 and new one as we speak) have just asked for my mailing address and sent me my equipment. They never have you pay for your own. Small company or big company, its no different. Sound almost like you haven't talk to them on the phone. That is a red flag too."
Are y'all really this desperate to work from home?
"I (32M) have spent 75% of my time working remote positions in the tech industry. I've worked for tiny companies (25 employees) to large companies (10,000 employees). Never had any company required me to buy office supplies from a specific vendor. 

In my experience they give me a WFH budget ($200 to $1,500) to buy stuff. The catch is, you have to purchase it with your own money but the company reimbursed you. Another downside, the money they give you during reimbursement is taxable. So you technically aren't 100% reimbursed.

Either way, I've always purchased my WFH equipment after acquiring my work laptop. This generally allows you to know the company is legit. I even ask my colleagues how their experience was with purchases WFH equipment. This allows me to have the situation and if it's worth it.

Additionally, if you are submitting personal tax documentations and other sensitive forms. The employer should have a secure portal (normally 3rd party) that allows you to enter this information. It's a huge red flag if they want it emailed directly to an HR person.

I've done the ""text interviews"". Normally also a red flag IMO. Companies that dude this are known to be scams OR underpay and overwork their employees. I'd personally avoid companies like this.

Another note, my experience is normally 4-6 interviews. Normally performed via zoom or in-person if there is a local office."
No. I'm a remote worker. After hire they sent me whatever I needed. There's no reason an employee should have to buy anything.
There should be a sticky at the top of this sub about common WFH scams.
"Super scammy, my wfh job is bring your own device and the company gives you a check for it."
">There should be a sticky at the top of this sub about common WFH scams.

WFH *is* the scam"
"Desperation for remote work is driving a lot of people into the waiting arms of scammers. Only \~13% of workers are fully remote [https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/#:\~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%2012.7%25%20of,to%20a%20hybrid%20work%20model](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%2012.7%25%20of,to%20a%20hybrid%20work%20model) but if you were to read reddit a lot, you would think it was like 80%."
"Any real employer wouldn't hire for a remote job, period. People who already have them are safe for now but after losing mine, I gave up on ever finding remote work again"
"The scammers will copy job ads from legit employers, even impersonate people from those companies whose real profiles you can find online. They fake documents with companies logos and even have fake HR papers for you to sign. If you're not familiar with remote work, it can be very easy to get caught up in the excitement of 'finally' finding a great remote job that you let your guard down. 

The texting interview part is new though. Usually it's on Skype and they also send fake employment questionairres and everything."
"Yep, I do WFH consulting and if the client requires it they send me a secure laptop...at their expense and with a return label. This is a scam."
"I think the main difference is timing. Did you already work at the company before purchasing equipment, or was it a requirement to begin working? I was at a company that sent you a laptop for WFH, but if you wanted extra things like another monitor/mouse/chair you picked what you wanted and they reimbursed up to a certain amount. The important thing being you received everything you needed to do the job without your money getting involved.

Requiring payment before even starting work is what screams scam."
"This makes no sense and a large company would onboard their remote workers in person, even if they WFH"
"I mean I get that it's only 13%, but you need to remove any jobs that can't be performed from home. Healthcare, trades, construction, retail, etc. I think more it would be more accurate to state what percentage of jobs that could be WFH are WFH. 

But you hit the nail on the head that there is a lot fewer remote jobs out there than people that want remote jobs."
That's because it's easier to get away with being on Reddit all day and not getting caught when you work from home
Yup. Hybrid is becoming the norm now. Businesses don't want to see their offices go unused and are probably getting all sorts of incentives from state governments to have employees go in. The only truly WFH jobs appear to be software developers or part time data entry jobs...
"My employer hires remote for everybody except the people handling the drugs themselves.

Nearly the entirety of finance, billing and processing, AP/AR, data entry, and customer service are all remote.

It's been fantastic because we can pull hires from the whole country, we're not limited to 3 different suburbs.

I've got staff covering until 9pm Eastern, with nobody working second shift (our business is all eastern states, I've got employees in Alaska and Hawaii working our evening service and still get to hire 9 to 5.

Natural disaster doesn't mean we're incapacitated. Our administrative office lost power for 2 weeks after a hurricane, didn't matter to the business at all. 8 people out of more than 90 lost the ability to work for a week, while they got set up to work from home. That office is now entirely archives with only 2 workstations, one in a conference room, the other for a traveling sales associate who works out of there periodically.


There's occasionally distraction or production issues, sure... But it's not like we were free of those before. The only real downside is having to pay shipping for most IT issues that could've been a 30 minute hardware swap before... But we're also not paying the power bills on the usage and not paying for chairs/desks so that certainly offsets the cost."
Says the loser who is jealous they can't work from home.
"I used to work for FB, they would definitely give you a phone number to contact them. And you get your work laptop during in-person orientation, even if you're WFH."
"LOL you guys got triggered AF, nah I retire at 50 with a $120k/yr state pension, Lieutenants can't WFH but we have 4 day weekends every week. Lighten up Francis."
Literally all of my employees work from home. My business partner is working from Ecuador right now. I plan to move to Italy and keep working from home. BEST SCAM EVER.
"I mean define ""fully remote"".  I work finance and I WFH about 90% of the time but still actually have my own office that sits empty most days."
No one is triggered. We're laughing at you from our cushy home offices.
"""Some argue this departure from remote work -- and a forcing of back-to-office policies -- is due to a suffering commercial real estate industry."" 

Yes, this has nothing to do with what I've said, that the departure from remote work and forcing RTO policies is directly related to the suffering of the commercial property values, and is definitely not from one of my sources either. And it's not a bit before the section literally titled ""Why CRE Values Matter"", and then it definitely doesn't explain the literal systemic risk I've already not described apparently.

Why would I bother addressing personal anecdotes, and a long drawn out argument that amounts to ""Nuh uh!""?"
">""Some argue this departure from remote work -- and a forcing of back-to-office policies -- is due to a suffering commercial real estate industry.""

Who argues that? Redditors? Martians? Where are the data?"
"It's not my fault you don't understand the basic notion that mostly made up reddit thing is a rough statement not meant to be precise. 

But sure, here: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/14g49l1/wfh\_vs\_rto\_narrative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/14g49l1/wfh_vs_rto_narrative/)

Always the same thing. No evidence. Pure speculation - just as you've done here."
"You not understanding how the article is entirely relevant to my point speaks solely to your cognitive abilities. Whether you acknowledge it or not, WFH's impact on real estate values is entirely relevant to the rhetorical position of believing that RTO policies are due to property values.

Secondly, i cited a second Forbes article as the first one was too complex for you to connect the dots, here it is again;

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2023/04/10/the-real-reason-why-companies-are-desperately-pushing-for-people-to-return-to-the-office/

Now, do go on a rant about how it's not applicable because it's in reference to the cities themselves and not the corporations 


Alllll against your....personal anecdotes, and laughable claims that this is an idea ""mostly made up"" on Reddit "
">WFH's impact on real estate values is entirely relevant to the rhetorical position of believing that RTO policies are due to property values.

That's your hypothesis, yes. But you're stating a hypothesis as fact. That's my issue.  

Your second article is more of the same. 

So, I agree that WFH is likely to have a negative effect on commercial real estate values (more specifically office CRE). I don't agree that there is sufficient evidence that reduced property values are the primary motivating force for companies to RTO (outside of the CRE sector)."
"Good. Hopefully this is a trend that continues. If US companies won't pull their heads out of their asses about remote work, let other companies poach their talent instead."
"With experience in bartending management and serving, I would look at companies that supply that industry and might need someone who has been inside the bar trade, knows the language, etc.

* restaurant/bar equipment, drink dispensers, refrigeration, storage, etc.
* glassware, barware
* cash register, order entry terminals
* menus, table tent cards, signage

You get the idea.  There are a bunch of companies (besides liquor) supplying what it takes to operate a bar.  At most of them, I would think that knowing the bar trade is an advantage.  Look for jobs at those companies first, THEN figure out if they're WFH."
"Call center environment wfh jobs will be your best bet 

1. Use a skill base resume to get pass the ATS gate

2. Add any BS computer course for basics computer skill like Microsoft words etc etc to your resume ( try Coursera.com ) 

3. Staffing agency , they hold lot of contracts to recruit with big companies like health insurance 

4. If you see a remote position you like use 
jobscan.co to see if you can get pass the ATS gate 

5. And finally because of the ATS now you literally have to tailor a resume to each position you apply too"
"Keep in mind that it's a job just done from home. Focus on the doing your job part first and foremost. A lot of people (myself included) have a WFH job that is more of a unicorn job where there is a lot of freedom are NOT the norm. Get up, do your morning routine, and prepare for work. Now, once you've been working for a bit, you will see what the norm is. Aim to be the best and ask questions. It's very exciting for you, so happy! Ask questions here as needed. We should always support each other. *"
"If your boss/superiors have to be in the office some then I recommend giving it your all and always being present the first couple of months to build trust, including providing something like a weekly list of tasks you are working on. You want them to view you as someone they don't have to worry about even if you are out of sight. 

I think from there you can start tasting the freedom of WFH a little."
"I would make a list of some things you want to incorporate into your new routine, and slowly start doing them. Just start off on a good note right off the bat. I switch to remote work pretty suddenly and had the whole ""I can do so much now"" mentality. But it took FOREVER to actually find a groove."
"Congrats to you! Been wfh since March 2022 I'm so thankful only wished I had been so many years ago lol. Get up, have a cup of coffee or whatever to start your day. Keep routine I'm saying this and overslept l this morning by like 25 mins lol"
Ahhh! This actually excellent advice!!! Basically go above and beyond for like the first 6 months to a year and then explore the benefits of WFH. Definitely doing that! Thanks a lot!
My job was too far from home. I couldn't complete my workouts at the gym because I was rushing to get home to prepare for the next and was so tired to even finish my workouts. I also found myself eating junk fast food at work because it was easy to access and couldn't resist the smells from the nearby restaurants. WFH will allow me to have control of these things!
"OP, looks like you have received enough feedback on your current employement options.  We tend to be bias towards WFH in this community.

Post locked"
"I'll say right off the bat that based on your description of the hybrid job, it sounds like you like office work and approve of your would-be co-workers so that's a huge factor, and I'd say probably should be the deciding factor since the pay difference is so small. But, imagine if the ""high stress"" job actually takes you less time to do, and you have time left over during the day to bring the stress down. I did the same thing exactly, took the ""high stress"" wfh job which turned out to be less stressful than the office job I had, and way more money. 

Overall, it sounds like you might enjoy the hybrid job more."
"I think you're going to get biased responses here. For me it would be completely bonkers to pick the 175k offer, but I love wfh. Take the one that makes you happier, they both pay plenty"
"If you miss going into the office, then I think the choice is pretty simple. Remote work is not for everyone. Some people like going in person and it sounds like you are one of them."
ill stick to 100% WFH
"Fair enough. For me, this decision wouldn't really be a WFH or not question, but many relative aspects of the jobs including the commute. 

I do get the appeal of the first one, particularly if you think you can deal with the commute. But people massively overvalue big companies and their ""safe, stable"" jobs.

I wouldn't judge a startup much on their hiring process at that size. Hiring sucks regardless of size or stage. I've found no correlation between the hiring process and size or lack of effective process otherwise at a company.

The biggest question is what you want in terms of career trajectory from this. You can advance much more quickly going to the right startup than you can with any brand name big company."
Yeah I don't mind working mornings and nights as long as I get to work from home
"Yeah, I am answering as if I was in the same situation. Sorry if that wasn't clear but I understand your point of view and OP's hesitation. If you don't mind commuting and would be stressed out with early/late meetings from home in a startup then yeah I could see why he doesn't want to stay fully remote. 

On a side note, I work for a big company (not a startup) that is known for having work life balance. They still make me have early/late meetings all the time despite advertising that. So you never really know. At least they still let me perma-WFH otherwise I would leave"
My last role had some occasions where I'd have to hop on meetings at 9pm and 6am and it made me hate my life. The biggest drawback of remote work is companies feeling like they can normalize these types of schedules IMO.
What career are you in? For example I am a software engineer.  Wfh isn't a job it's the location of a job. Also btw I am close to giving up on wfh myself. Most software jobs are hybrid or on site. The remote software jobs just have too much competition.
"I was in banking for 5 years, then switched to the mortgage industry which is WFH. I'm In compliance."
"I'm in banking operations! Also, wow I always thought software engineering was remote friendly! If software engineers are struggling with getting to work from home then we're all screwed."
"I would not use my personal laptop or desktop computer to log into work stuff.  Maybe if I had a spare or old laptop that I could clean out, but otherwise  nope. 

They really  should provide  the equipment  for remote work.   Honestly,  I'd be tempted  to ask  them how you're supposed  to ""remote into"" the work computer  if they don't give you a machine to use.  

Ask for a written policy  on what info they are able to see or track if you are using a personal  device.  What software  will you need to install? And what happens if you leave the company  - will they need to wipe your personal  device?"
No way.   Not in a million years would I use my personal equipment to do a job that I am being paid for. If they are truly a legit company they will provide you with what you need to work from home. I don't even have a personal pc.
"I have to say that this seems like a pain. When we went WFH several people did remote desktop to their systems in the office and it always seemed to be problematic. There was someone onsite who just went around restarting systems when they froze or there was some power issue. 

Other people used a virtual desktop and that seemed less troublesome.

I wonder if they would consider a laptop next replacement cycle?

Of course they can have any requirements they want.

Good luck to you"
"So there's actually multiple ways an employee can work from home. It's not always company issued laptops. At my last job, we had to install something called Citrix, which simply lets you access the remote work computer associated with your employment. It's literally the same computer if I walked into the office and sat down. Typically, work desktops aren't actual physical machines, but rather a cloud instance. The machines you see in office are simply just hooked up to receive and emulate the cloud instance. It's why you're able to go to the office and sit at ANY cubicle desk, sign in, and literally get the same emulation of your assigned work computer. Same thing happens at home when you use a client called Citrix (or whatever you're assigned to use).

At my current job, we have work issued laptops, and that works differently in that things are local to this specific machine."
"> So you also have a separate dedicated internet service just for work? By your logic you should. 

Yes, actually. It's not my logic, it's the law in the US to one extent or another.

Federally, mandatory equipment/resources, including a portion of your internet or any mandatory mobile connection, can't reduce your effective pay below minimum wage for that given week.

> So you go to the office and work on the provided desktop there.

Yes, the federal rule does only apply if WFH is the nature of the job or mandatory in some other fashion. If it's voluntary, you can just go into the office.

In many states, they have specific guidelines for remote work equipment and reimbursement that supercede the federal minimum requirements.

> I keep everything separated, but some things are just crazy.

My employer (3k employees) provides equipment for my fully WFH job and a monthly stipend toward my internet and mobile plans. My last employer did, too, and they were considerably smaller (150 employees).

What I want to know is why working-class people who earn 3 dog shits per hour try to lock the boots of these companies, especially the giant/rich ones, who can and should be paying for their own equipment?"
"Best places to move is those pockets outside the city where you aren't yet rural but still far enough to have lower housing cost while still close enough to reasonably enjoy city life when you wanna go out. 

My daughter is in a program in elementary school and once that's up we're moving about another 20-45 mins out that puts us in the area I described. Big houses on acre(s) for what we'd pay for almost no yard and half the size house that's inside the city

Just shoveling away for a big down payment till then

With the expansion of remote work though a lot of people are doing this too so gotta move faster than before"
"The whole point of working remotely beside avoiding commutes and for the socially-anxious, avoiding in person interactions, is to have the flexibility to live where you want. If you think you'd be happy at the new spot, who cares what anyone else thinks."
"We did this during the pandemic. We never really like the suburbs but had to move there at some point as it was in between our two jobs at the time. When we knew for sure that we'd both be working remotely for the long term, we asked ourselves why we'd stay there and started planning to go elsewhere. We found we preferred the quiet of being far outside the city. 

It's been a great move for us. We have more space and lots of quiet. We're not outdoors people so most of our activities are in the house. We also don't mind a longer drive for groceries or shopping in general. So if you can swing it, why not?"
I work from home and my husband and I moved 1.5 hours north away from our family to a small town at the beginning of the mountains. Best decision we ever made
"I know I'm late to the party here, but my wife and I did this and don't regret it for a second. COL is sooo much cheaper. Sure, it's ~1hr in all directions to bigger cities, but we don't care lol. Our tiny town has a Dollar General, a few awesome local restaurants, stunning outdoor activities, and everything we normally need. We also subscribe to one of those meals kits, Everyplate, which honestly feels cheaper than groceries anyways, plus it lowers our really needed grocery runs to about once a month.

Make sure you can get good internet for WFH. We use T-Mobile home internet as they have a 5G tower here. 

Only big negative for us is once we have kids that are school age, the schools out here are , which is fairly common for rural areas. We'll have to figure out moving, or doing a long commute for a Charter School."
Small town wfh person here. I love it. Grew up in the city and much prefer it this way.
"I grew up in a town of approximately 1000 people and it was a great place to live. One thing I did miss out on was any chance for AP credit in high school so I didn't get out of any college classes. There were also fewer options for sports and clubs. However, the entire town, and even surrounding towns came out for our major events. In a large city, almost nobody supports their local school if they are not parents, family or friends, but in a small town, everybody follows their team regardless of age.

I moved to the city for college and stayed because that was my only choice at the time. WFH didn't exist and I really didn't have any options. Now I don't think I could ever get my wife to move to a small town with me, even after our children graduate and move out.

Small towns can be both good and bad. They are good because they are less expensive, very friendly, generally slower, quieter, less crime, etc. However, most small towns have fewer services than the large cities. They may not have nearly as many options for phones or Internet. Some towns have a hospital, others have doctors that only work there a couple of days a week. Restaurants can be hit or miss."
"My husband and I sold our house in Salt Lake City and moved into a Winnebago to find a new home in Asheville, NC. Small mountain town for now (but TONS of remote workers move here). Our families definitely don't love it, but a couple years of a new adventure always sounds good to me :)"
I live in a small town and work from home. All I can say is make sure to move to an area that has good internet service.
"We're in our early 40s with one kid. My spouse has WFH for maybe 10 years, and I'm a SAHM. He hated where we were since he grew up on a farm, and I'm always sort of ambivalent. 

He starts watching these harbor cam videos and starts showing them to me. We decided to go there for a week during covid and loved it. That spring we sold our place and rented a house on the lake. That fall we bought 40 acres in the woods and building a small passive house and workshop. 

Our place is just outside of a town of 3000 people, and it's fantastic. The people are nice and laid back, scenery is beautiful,  We're learning to cross country ski and kayak. Our kid is in all kinds of activities her last school didn't have. 

We're building the house ourselves so even with the higher interest rate we're on track to have a similar payment as our too big, city house. 

If you Iike it go for it. I love the water and icing on this lake and having solitude has completely changed us. Sure building a house is stressful, but because we feel like we're getting everything we want it doesn't feel that bad and will soon be over.

Since someone else mentioned the main reason we chose the county we did was one had invested in fiber over a decade ago while the adjacent one didn't and had very slow, spotty service even in the 90k city. We decided to just focus on finding land in the county with fiber. It's been easy peasy."
"The drawback to small towns + remote work is that ISPs can be limited, expensive, and/or not available. Make sure you can get the bandwidth you need at the address where you'll be living, and don't trust the generic availability websites where you plug in your address to check. It's much better than it used to be, but it can still be a shock if you aren't prepared and end up somewhere with limited availability (been 100% remote since 2005 at the same company, but moved 6x in that time, 4 of which were rural areas with sketchy service). In addition to bandwidth you need to look into uptime; fast Internet is useless if it's out every other week. Congrats and good luck!"
"I'm thinking about the North as well.

Sounds amazing,  couple hundred acres for cheap,  solar/wind power system,  Starlink. WFH makes it possible.

Shopping once a month a no problem for me.  Going into stores is one of my least favorite activities,  rather go hiking or biking."
"I've been WFH for 8 years. The most important thing is dedicated space. You mentioned needing to use your kitchen table. Will you need to tear down every day?

If you have to tear down every night all you really need is a good mouse and solid headphones/mic. Anything more and you'll hate the hassle of set up and tear down every day"
Definitely!  I'm starting a new remote position next week.  The client is providing the computer and the recruiter has already sent the monitors. One place I contracted for gave their permanent employees an annual home office allowance.
"healthcare IT is not going to be as remote friendly as others as many of the administrators and other roles for the hospital are in person. as an org, they are more in person vs wfh so the disposition will be to have more in person work."
"I work for a small system. All our corporate finance, business intelligence, and many IS roles are fully remote since 2020.

Before the pandemic they were very stingy with WFH, but now it's quite accepted. It would be quite a cost to lease all that office space again so I haven't heard a murmur about it in over a year."
"Hospitals/clinics, etc tend to be more on site due to old on-site equipment that needs a hands-on touch.  If you want to stay in the Healthcare IT side, you may want to look at companies that sell software/systems to hospitals/clinics as they would have a higher chance of being full WFH.   Even then, the thinking of many companies in this space is old, outdated, and are very slow to adapt to new technologies or work situations.   
Personally, I do not miss working in healthcare IT."
Our largest hospital system in the state just outsourced most IT to Accenture. They seem to think remote work fits IT in a healthcare system. But I'm willing to bet they wouldn't extend the same offer to in-house employees should they ever in-source.
I work from home for a large hospital system. 4 years strong!
"Senior Technical Analyst here for a large non-profit hospital organization. My entire team is remote. We were remote for two years BEFORE COVID hit. They like remote because it allows them to get talent from all over, and not just in the area around headquarters. The only company I have ever worked for that understands the value of remote work."
I work for a large hospital. Almost 100% WFH for hundreds of IT employees
"I've been working for a hospital system for 10+ years doing ""IT"" and it's been WFH for over a decade. Manager discretion. We meet a few times a year. Some teams meet weekly.

There is nothing as far as HIPAA that prevents it.

I don't know how common/uncommon it is"
In healthcare IT you often have to deal with personal health information and other sensitive data and if you're working remotely there are more opportunities for that information to potentially be compromised. Fines for HIPAA violations are not cheap so organizations will do anything possible to avoid them.
No. The system I work for is large and has confirmed that they will commit to WFH staying for many roles.
I also wfh for a smaller health system. We will not be going back on-site except one 2 day retreat a year.
Try insurance. It might be similar systems and depending on the company very WFH friendly
"Me too going on 8 years now.  The unicorn healthcare WFH jobs are out there, but they're harder to find unless you're already established within the healthcare system internally already."
Exactly. I'm trying to move positions but there's no other good WFH jobs in my hospital.... I feel trapped lol.
">Workers logging on from home five days a week were 35% more likely to be laid off in 2023 than their peers who put in office time, according to an analysis of two million white-collar workers conducted by employment data provider Live Data Technologies. The analysis showed 10% of fully remote workers were laid off last year, compared with 7% of those working in an office full time or on a hybrid basis.

remote workers are also way more likely to work in tech which have suffered most layoffs in 2023, but why let the truth get in the way of some good fear mongering"
"It's not surprising. A lot of companies use contract labor to handle the remote workers, so many aren't direct hires who are the first let go in a layoff.

In the article it says managers who don't see you at work assume you are working less and don't see your work. Why don't they see your work? What is their job if they aren't seeing your end product? My manager has to review my work before it gets final approval. If a manager isn't necessary to review the work and they just assume it's getting done, I have doubts that the manager is needed for anything other than scheduling. Let the manager go. 

I understand it's human nature to think out of site is out of mind but a lot of companies use data and metrics to measure performance. So if emotions are used to make layoff decisions rather than data then well that's stupid."
"Let me get this straight, managers ""prefers"" to lay off remote workers regardless on their productivity and knowledge? WCGW?

If I walk right now and take my 30+ years of institutional knowledge with me. Who do they think they will hurt more? me or the company?

These articles are written without taking nuances into considerations and reduced the logical to ""in-person"" vs ""I don't see you"" and therefore easier to lay you off. What a lazy and dumb conclusion for a complicated situation."
"Just proves that the whole reward system is most definitely not a meritocracy, but is instead based on who the manager personally likes the most. It says a lot more about the companies and their BS system of politics and favoritism than it does remote work."
No it's because most layoffs have occurred recently at white collar jobs with a remote work component
"I see what they mean though first hand..  So far all layoffs at my company have been the remote workers.  I think its easier to lay off the remote guy rather than the guy making jokes at the water cooler every morning and having drinks out on Fridays, all else being equal.  Humans are humans."
"Sadly ""wants to work from home"" is not a protected class"
"I know most managers are necessary. I've been a manager more often than a subordinate. And useless managers are the exception rather than the rule. But in my experience all large organizations and many medium sized organizations house a couple that have no purpose other than to monitor the work of others. Technology eliminates most of that work. Remote work has shown that such management is not needed, at least not at that level. Organizations can get by with fewer of these types of work flow managers. I find the most useless ones are also the most disproportionally visible, vocal, pampered and endured."
"This sounds like bad news.

WFH has to come from the top of you want any sort of peace of mind about it. 

What you don't want is to be part of some experiment where they watch your every move, and any misstep is blamed on WFH"
"Your fighting the odds here, only about 12% of the workforce is full time remote work and more are being sent back to work every day.  Job market is tightening, headed in the favor of the employer...   Even if you find a full remote, it's unlikely to last."
"It's actually the opposite. 4.2 million workers will be leaving the workforce this year.  Remote working is trending higher , much much higher. 

Stanford economist Nick Bloom is a good resource if you are interested in the data. 

To the OP, have you brought on a few recruiters to scout jobs for you? They work on your behalf to find  you roles and they are DESPERATE right now. Workers have the leverage in this economy."
"There is a manager that works with the same company I do. They are 100% WFH and traveled all over the US, during COVID. Company found out and didn't mind, because the work was still being done.

Some companies will freak out and others won't, so this is a hard one to predict. My last company wouldn't like it, due to tax issues."
Seeing all the people posting about getting WFH positions is giving me hope. Got my 7th desk rejection email last night. le sigh...
"The only I can say is that I went from working FT in hospital to a remote job several years ago .  It didn't take long to lose strength , flexibility and my metabolism .  Sitting all day can leave you stiff and weak so you need to be extra diligent about getting your steps in daily with exercise.  Don't snack !  Sitting all day then add eating the same amount of meals is a no no .  Also, make yourself go out a few days a week and especially on weekends to stay social. .  I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer , but although WFH has great advantages it has a downside too and I wish someone would have warned me .  I literally could feel my health deteriorate"
"I'm a nurse and about to start a WFH job too! We also do 12 hour shifts running non-stop. It's really a change, I actually enjoy the active part of my work now, but the stress, physical and emotional abuse really get to me, and my knees and back are starting to feel the wear and tear. I'm a little down about working a 5 day week but I think overall it'll be less exhausting. After my 3 shifts per week I'd sleep the next day and be pretty wiped out the following day too, so what's the point? It's also going to be a raise for me. I feel so lucky."
"I'm 6 years from retirement and I just started working my dream wfh job last year.  Your expectations may be a little high. 
Best of luck to you on your search "
"Really?  Go onto any job board (LinkedIn, GlassDoor, Indeed, etc.) and when you setup your search, choose REMOTE for the location. 

Nearly every day there is a post just like this one. ""I'm a recent graduate with no actual work experience. How do I find a REMOTE job that pays at least $60k per year.""  Oh, and you were actually surprised that there weren't any remote internships? 

I mean, I like to be helpful here on Reddit as much as the next person, but honestly, try READING the other posts for your answer because this question is asked constantly. I realize we had the pandemic and everything, but you still have no experience. Few managers will allow you to WFH for you because you have no work experience until you've proven yourself to be dependable and get your work done. 

That said, if you dead set on ANY remote-only job, sales or helpdesk is gonna be your best bet. Sales was remote when it was still called telecommuting."
"You have to find 10 friends that already work remote, pal around with them a bit, maybe pick up some chores, cut their grass, wash their car, etc...

Chances are that one of those 10 will be a gatekeeper and will, in time, let you at least start joining the monthly Teams meeting that we all go to. 

Once you've started joining meetings and getting to learn more wfh folks, and they deem you worthy, then, and only then, you may be tagged for next years pledge class. 

Just fyi, initiation can be tough, so keep an open mind.  It's only as weird as you make it."
"I just graduated and have no experience but want a WFH job that pays $100k a year! Wah!

Seen about a hundred a week. You go blind after a while."
"The entitlement of a recent college graduate with zero skills giving up opportunities because they want a WFH job. The reason that you want a WFH Job is obvious, you believe that it will be easier, low stress and your ""career"" won't impede a fun filled life. 

This makes decision makers at companies extremely leery to keep WFH. They don't want to deal with making specific rules for new hires that are different than seasoned employees. Then they will have to continually answer to these employees every month, who will ask ""am I approved for WFH yet"" or ""why can Sally WFH, and I can't, etc etc"" 

Trust me when I tell you this. This is the exact situation where extremely busy executives just say ""f-this, bring them all back"". 

I'm not saying this to be a jerk to you. I'm being honest, as someone who actually has to make these decisions. I think WFH is actually great for a lot of people and a lot of jobs. If I began having recent grads demanding WFH, I would not only seriously consider RTO, but be very diligent when allowing my team to hire any recent grads. 

I hope my answer was satisfactory? You may not like it, but it is the truth."
"/u/GPTCT What I do not understand, and would like your perspective on, is what is so contentious about WFH anyways? 

Clearly, many people want WFH. The reason many people want it is because:
1. The time saved that was previously wasted commuting.
2. People can use their lunch hour to both make and eat their lunch, rather than having to spend time the evening before making lunch. They have more free time in the evening for themselves.
3. It is cheaper. Some companies, like mine, want me to come into the office but expect me to pay for parking. Previous companies I have worked at at least paid for parking. Not to mention cost of gas and vehicle maintenance.
4. A lot of jobs, you can do the exact same thing at home, but with significantly less distraction. No more wasting time talking to Bob while making coffee. My boss recently got mad at me because I was working from home (hybrid role) and refused to go into the office to sit on an office computer in a zoom meeting. Apparently me being in the same zoom meeting from my house was ""less productive"".
5. Studies continually show working from home is more productive. Certainly, in my job, that is definitely the case. My job requires calling people all over the world a lot, so being in an office hearing 40+ people yammering away on their phones to clients is stupid, because I have clients tell me they cannot hear me over the background noise and I have to step away to talk to them. 
6. Not only are workers more productive when they WFH (I understand certain jobs like construction, WFH is obviously impossible), but it has the potential to reduce overhead costs significantly. Workers also clearly value quite highly WFH, which companies could then offer as a perk to attract top talent, and, as my cynical self would expect, take advantage of WFH to offer workers lower wages in exchange. Companies follow the money at the expense of everything else, so why they aren't embracing WFH is beyond me. Companies that are smart are offering WFH and poaching top talent from companies that refuse to adapt. WFH is here to stay, so companies need to embrace it or they will eventually go the way of the dinosaur.

I also think WFH is getting pushback from middle management boomers that have an antiquated idea that butts in seats = productivity. Not to mention, most of middle management is a complete waste of space anyway. Their underlings work harder than them and middle management makes an important decision once in a while. I think middle management is scared that WFH will shine the light on what little they do."
"I'll do my best to answer your specific questions, but I will start with my personal view on WFH and why it's so contentious;

First off, I think WFH is great for may jobs and many employees. I fully support it and have been vocal in my executive leadership team meetings as well as board meetings. Unfortunately it's much more nuanced than many people want to believe. There are many people no matter the job that can not work from home. They do not have the skill or discipline. These are the same people who cause massive issues when they are not allowed to WFH. 

Second, it has never been contentious until Covid, but now it has become contentious due to the forced WFH and employees wanting it to continue no matter what. Very few in Sr. Leadership want to force ultra productive WFH employees to RTO, the problem is with the new employees or the ones who aren't working hard. It is very difficult to pull them back into the office and single them out, so many companies just say RTO or hybrid for everyone. Obviously there are a lot of specific nuances to this, but this is the main issue. 

I'll answer each point and will expand if you would like to continue the conversation.

1) I agree that the time saved commuting is great and can make good workers even more productive. The problem is that many workers aren't disciplined workers who want to do what's best for the company. As seen in this sub, as well as many others. Many people HATE working and believe that they are being exploited by greed monsters. They will do anything they can to screw the company. 

2) I completely agree with this assessment. Again, great workers with drive and integrity aren't the issue. They are being harmed by the bad workers who want WFH to basically get a paycheck for doing as little as possible (if you read this sub much, at least 1/3 of the posts are people who post about only working 2 hours a day. The vast majority of the comments are people telling them to ""do it as little as possible for as long as you can"" ""never work harder than you are asked"" etc etc. Another popular post is young people asking about WFH jobs because of how ""Amazing"" it sounds"")

3) Did your company pay for parking pre Covid? If not, this point is moot and actually hurts the WFH case. Like many other staunch WFH points, these ""pay for my commute"" points cause decision makers to become increasingly frustrated and less likely to accept any arguments. We are all human beings, there are many stupid points for RTO that make you pissed off and hate the people saying it. This is one of those points but on the other side. 

4) Yes, many jobs can be done at home. Many also need to be in the office at least some of the time. All jobs are different and many benefit significantly from being able to randomly and quickly walk over to your coworker or boss and to get help or collaborate. (Yes the word collaboration is used a lot for RTO and it sends people into a tailspin. I'm not using that as a talking point to say that's why everyone needs to RTO. Collaboration is a real thing and to simply claim it does not exist is also BS. It's the opposite side of the same coin) 

5) Many studies are actually showing the opposite. Unfortunately anyone can find a study ""proving"" their point. If you were sent 10 studies showing how RTO is more productive, you will pick it apart and not accept it. The same can be done from the other side. There are way too many variables to make the issue black and white. Every study will depend on the inputs, and unless the study was from your specific department in your specific company, it's pointless. 

6) Again, it's not black and white. The vast majority of jobs aren't monkey work where there is a task that needs to be done by one person and once it's done they grab another one. Business is dynamic, if companies find that they will save significant money and have a happier and more productive workforce, that's what they will do. You(and many others) WANT to believe that because you are more productive in A WFH environment, everyone is. 

7) This type of thinking is so simplistic and childish that it's hard to even reply to. Are there incompetent assholes in middle management? Yes, no question. Are there incompetent assholes in all levels of organizations? Yes, and this is a large part of the reason that companies are going RTO. The concept that WFH is better for everyone involved, it saves money and creates a much more highly productive workforce, BUT some people in middle management roles believe ""butts in the seats equates productivity"", so companies will sacrifice much higher profits to capitulate to these middle managers? Please think about this from a rational perspective; No business owners, Boards of directors or Executive managers will sacrifice the long term health and profitability of their company because of a middle managers neurosis. They are middle managers for a reason. They don't make decisions for the company. It's this type of rational from the employees that irritates Sr. managment to the point of just going RTO."
"He wants a ""remote"" job not one where he WFH.  Get it?

He wants to work on remote controls for devices, building them, fixing them, etc.  That's what he meant.  Because a remote is a noun and remote can also be an adjective.

Which may I add is apparently some sort of very lame prank based on the ambiguousness of the word ""remote""."
"I appreciate you taking the time to address each of the things I said. 

You mention that some people slack off when working from home, but from what I have seen, these same people will just pretend to work most of the time if in the office. So what difference does it make? These are people that need to be flushed out anyway, and i would say it is necessarily a problem related to WFH.

I am relatively young in my career, but one of the biggest lessons I have learned, unfortunately, is that perception matters more than reality in business. I have led the company and was consistently in the top 10 for sales when working remotely during covid, but now they are trying to make me RTO anyway. If lazy John is staring at his computer doing nothing or slacking off while in the office, people will be happier than if he does the same thing when WFH. 

Studies I have seen suggest workers in the office get ~3 hours of work done a day anyway and the rest is just pretending to work in the office, i.e., its an act in the office and perhaps the mask comes off when WFH for some people. I do not see that as symptomatic of WFH problems but rather people being forced to confront false perceptions they had about productivity when it came to office work. What are your thoughts on this?"
I don't the issue has been the demand for work from home from employees. It's the supply of WFH  that seems to be fluctuating right now as both sides work to create an equilibrium.
"You have to do what's right for you. WFH is one factor of many, and you have to balance that factor against the rest of the job package -- including responsibilities and how you'll spend your days. It's a question of whether the perks of WFH outweigh the downsides of the job description. Only you can answer that."
You can include your current job and if they ask why you're looking to move so soon  explain that you are looking for a position that offers remote work arrangements and also interesting meaningful work with room for growth and then explain why that job in this particular company is something you could bring value to because (how your skills experience qualifications march the job description and fluff about how you are attracted to the culture and mission of the org)
"I have lost weight since reporting the the office since the spring.  It requires more walking to and from the building plus taking a walk during lunch.  I can't snack at my desk easily as I have to wear a mask due to heath reasons Vs it is easier to snack at home. 


Don't get me wrong I am pro WFH, but just adding another side to the argument."
Maybe try looking into customer service online chat roles? Although I agree that it will be extremely hard to balance a WFH position and caring for a newborn. Wishing you the best of luck in your search!!
" I would definitely look for interpreter jobs. Or chat I've seen some that are looking for bilingual. It is doable to wfh with kids. Get a good set of noise cancelling headphones, I have the poly voyager focus 2, definitely worth the money. You will get in a routine of having things set out for easy access before your shift and you will also see what hrs you for sure need help, etc within a few weeks. Good luck. "
"I would not recommend working full time with a child at home full time. I always see people saying they're able to do it, but the reality is you CANNOT give 100% to two things at once. WFH does not mean you don't need childcare. It's the people who think they can do both that ruin WFH for everyone else. I don't mean to be rude, but it's true. I had a colleague whose kids were home all day, and he wasn't doing his job. It was obvious to our boss and to everyone who worked with him. We almost had to return to the office because of him, but I convinced my boss to make only him go back to the office. It's just not fair for those who pay for childcare and do their jobs."

"My wife and I both WFH in supervisor roles and we have a 4 year old. Zoom meetings, management meetings in Teams, escalations, plus all the analytics that go with the role every day and we NEVER get complaints about noise or being distracted. Because you can't do it does not mean it cannot be done. Side note: the company I work for and more specifically the LOB I'm on is concentration camp strict about ZERO TOLERANCE for background noise, I've had to term agents for their smoke alarm beeping."
"Not what you want to hear, but you have to think about that. WFH jobs have you chained to your keyboard and phone. Your environment has to be quiet and free of distractions. That doesn't fit with babies."
Oh yeah like for wfh csr?
"I completely agree with the benefits of WFH and how they benefit families. My husband and I both work from home as well. I start work early so I can log off at 3 and pick up my daughter from school. My husband starts later so he can do drop off. It works great for us. But your math is not adding up. Even if both of you work 8 hours a day, there is no way to provide enough attention to a young child unless you are starting work in the early morning and finishing well into the night. 

I do have noise cancelling headphones, but I don't use them to drown out my child. I use them to drown out my husband while he's on another call. We have been able to work with her home before, but she is definitely not getting the attention she needs and deserves if we are actually doing our jobs. It's just not possible."
"It's all well and good that some people love the office but maybe play the mental health=performance card.

I did my last day yesterday at a job where I respect and like my coworkers. A lot of them initially loved WFH but eventually they started feeling lonely. Some people are very devoted to their jobs and have little going on outside of it, they need the office. In my exit interview I got asked how I would manage my social needs outside of work because this mystified certain people.

You may never be able to get them to understand, but then again you know that's probably where this is going. All the best finding another employer."
">Right, I'm in finance and the company I was just with a few months ago announced they were getting ready to get back in the office and I started looking and secured my dream remote job for more money and better benefits. Full time remote also. Super happy that I left

Congrats on taking the bull by the horns!

**I really hope you let your old employer** ***why*** **you left.** The more that employers hear how important WFH is, and the more they actually see intelligent and valued employees leave because of its non-existence, it ultimately will **help all of us retain this right** to work from home."
"As a software engineer I can tell you that there are many advantages of working from the office when there are other people around you. It really isn't about the bosses wanting to see people, there are a lot of intangibles that you miss when remote. We have a young team and training is much easier in person than it is remote.

When you don't have your earphones in, there are often a lot of hallway conversations. I have jumped into conversations many times over the years when I had helpful answers. It is also useful to just hear what people are discussing. You learn to tune it out when you need to get work done and it just becomes background noise like your music.

I also like being able to just slide over to another person's desk and work with them. All of this is lost when one or both people are remote. I feel that the interruptions are outweighed by the benefits of collaboration.

However, many people who do go into the office wear earphones all day so they are not interrupted as often. They like the silence or music and find that they are more productive that way. If you are going to do that all day, there is very little advantage of being in the office because you are still not participating in conversations.

I now work from home 4 days a week and I often miss going to the office. We have ""collaboration Wednesdays"" where the office buys food so many people go in. There isn't a whole lot of advantage of going in more than that because so few people are there to talk to and I can do my job just as well from home. Many people moved and are permanent remote. I save a lot of gas money (2 gallons a day when I drive) and recently bought two 32 inch QHD monitors, which is a big upgrade from the company-supplied 24 inch 1080p monitors."
"I agree! If you love working remotely then seek a position in a remote-first company. I too work in a remote-first company and everything is efficiently managed. The big organisations always have followed the in-office model and they were clueless with wfh setup. 

P.S. That's a very well-written blog!"
"There needs to be a balance though. I get that its tough trusting employees to be 100% remote. But wouldn't two days in the office be enough for you to feel satisfied that they're real people and they're not skipping town when they're supposed to be working? I think it also comes down to creating systems that make it easy to objectively appraise their performance and give timely feedback. It should also be the responsibility of the employer to set deadlines assign assign work so that employees know what work they have to do, and the employer isn't just dumping it on their lap 30 minutes before they hope to leave for the day. 

A lot of the reasons against WFH work boils down to employers wanting to avoid minor inconveniences to them. When retention becomes an issue and clients complain about turnover, you better believe employers will figure out how to make WFH work if the top talent is demanding it."
"Expect that they will be monitoring you. Not necessarily with something as obvious as a webcam, either; software that tracks the number of keystrokes and mouse movements is very common, and they can tell the difference between ""actually working"" input versus ""attached an oscillating fan to my mouse"" input and print out nice clear reports for your boss. Most times the software is buried in the system services, therefore it may not be super obvious. So, don't fuck around. It's very easy to get caught.

I like to have a dedicated ""work space"" and ""work mindset""; if I'm sitting in that chair, at that computer, I am working. When I log off for the evening, I take a mental step back.

Keep a nice, professional-looking shawl or loose sweater over the back of your office chair or somewhere near it. If you suddenly get called into an unexpected video call, it can be super useful to grab and throw over your shoulders, and suddenly no one can see your WFH clothes. Some people prefer to dress nicely even when they WFH as that helps them get into the work mindset; I don't, but that's just me.

Dedicate a portion of your desk for your cats and lure them to it with a nice comfy blanket (mine prefer my favorite bathrobe). They will claim a spot anyway; might as well encourage them to go to one semi-out of the way."
"If you're one of those people who, whilst hating the commute, found the distinction it provides you between 'home time' and 'work time' helpful, make your own (far less stressful, expensive, and long) commute: walk around the block, go for a walk to get coffee or breakfast each morning, and when you get back, approach it like you would walking into the office: head for desk, get settled in and start working.

I've found that to be really helpful instead of rolling out of bed at 8.59am with zero motivation and still wishing I were asleep. At least this way I get a nice 15 minute amble around the neighbourhood, get some caffeine in me, and some natural daylight to help with the circadian rhythm; but there's no overcrowded and delayed trains or hellish traffic to contend with so it's very chilled and easygoing. When the weather is nice I also go for lunchtime walks at a nearby park to help keep my steps up, and try to go to the gym at least twice per week before work. Basically enjoy the wonderful freedom of WFH without needing to be cooped in like during covid."
"Woohoo! Childfree gang!
There was a recent post about best purchases for WFH (mouse jiggler, comfy [insert company WFH dress code] clothes, quality chair, etc).
What industry/position are you in?"
"I actually put my favorite couch in my home office and also set up the monitors and the desk.  So when I have meetings or something where I need both, I can flip to the desk, and when I need to be cozy and comfy I work on the couch."
"Hey thank you very much!  I know we'll be working on the Eastern time zone but I didn't consider learning the time zone of everyone, that's a really good idea.

Thankfully(?) I'm coming from a very high-production type of role and going to what *appears* to be a much lower-production role, but I'm pretty aware of my capabilities and have a healthy mix of imposter syndrome so I should be good there.

I appreciate all of your advice - This company is a mix of on-site and remote workers, but this position was specifically a remote position.  A friend of mine also works for this company remotely and has had a great experience the past year and a half so I'm pretty hopeful but my guard kinda stays up."
"I work from home full time, and my husband does on occasion. We have our real work set up desks next to each other, but we also have a really small desk in the bedroom with everything ready to go. Dock with extra monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This way the once or twice a month we are both having a meeting at the same time one of us can go to the mini work station and just plug in and go. We used an old desk, and spent less than $200 on a stand, monitor, dock, and wireless keyboard and mouse setup. Highly recommend a mini work station just incase."
"That's not a bad idea!  My wife can work from home as well, and on the rare occasion it was both of us from home one of us just went to the dining room, but lost the external monitors.  Maybe I'll invest.

Thanks for the great advice!"
"No. Never heard of such a thing. There are recruiters who specialize in certain fields like IT or Medical, but no...no one specializes in work from home jobs because that's not a real thing.  Search for the position first, then filter whether it's remote. 

You need to know what position you're looking for.  If you just search for anything that's ""Work from home"" you're going to run across a lot of scams, and a lot of low paying BS."
"No because ""work from home"" is a job LOCATION not a field of work or skill set."
Wayfair has some wfh positions
"There are national, state and local laws that regulate business and employment practices.  Companies can be fined and/or sued violations in whatever court system applies.  When hiring a remote worker, the company must consider their ability to comply with laws.  They will incur additional expenses of hiring local lawyers and accountants.  Most significantly, they must be able to control their potential liability if something goes wrong.

Imagine what would happen if an international remote worker gets hacked because the local infrastructure isn't secure.  Or an employee decides they can make more money selling business secrets to competitors.  A US company would have a difficult time getting a local government to care.  The local government has no duty to protect a US business."
"As someone who worksin this field and hire WFH, we have found many Indians trying to con us by working multiple jobs, jerking us around having multiple people saying they are one person and shifty things like that. We've stopped.looking there.

 Overall I have found India to have a dishonest workforce."
">someone in the same timezone

Not relevant. I spent a year commuting between US ET and UK time. One week in US and two weeks in UK, lather, rinse, repeat. Although US is home for me, I told my management and staff I would live UK time regardless of where I happened to be. Lots of remote workers are similar. 

My grandfather was a newspaper truck driver in NYC. He lived his entire adult life +12 hours. 

Time zones really don't matter."
"No they shouldn't, it puts people out of work especially WFH. If they did it in my state I would lose all the work I do and have been doing for over two years. We still have to pay taxes so they need to just leave us alone, it should be our choice who we work for, not have it limited by some ""classification"".  It is the one place where WFH is pretty much guaranteed."
It is best to assume you are being monitored. Just because you don't like using 2 computers doesn't mean you should find a way through your work laptop. If you are working for a legitimate company it is best to suck it up and keep the work computer for work. You are putting yourself at risk of losing your job or WFH position. Is it worth the risk?
"Remote access tools such as Google Remote Desktop (Anydesk, Teamviewer, Steamlink, Parsec and others) will basically just mirror your local screen to the remote client... That said, yes, someone in front of your machine will see everything that you're doing and maybe even interacting with your user session, by moving mouse and keyboard.

To be able to remotely access your machine and have some privacy, you would need something such as ThinLinc (but ThinLinc server only runs on Linux hosts) or windows native RDP which locks local access while you're using remotely, but RDP is know for its security flaws, it is better if you use it with some caution along with some host isolation (VPN, zerotier, netmaker or other networking tools to be able to mitigate some attacks).

Either way, (ThinLinc on Linux host or RDP on Windows), you'd need to configure your work machine asking for approval as you said. That said, ThinLinc is free for up to 10 concurrent users, your company could have a centralized remote desktop server running Linux and have remote users to use this machine as a remote desktop for employees working remotely."
Ask for the WFH accommodation in writing.
"Think of it this way, there are absolutely no lifelong guarantees in businesses.  That being said, make sure they put it in writing clearly what they expect from you when they make the offer.  Like any job, at some point you may want to leave for one reason or another.  Going back on fully WFH could be one of them."
"You could get it in writing, but they could change it. At our place, the statement is that they can change WFH with 30 days notice. We've always had some fully remote people even before the pandemic, so them being totally outside of our ""usual"" work range might help them keep WFH.

We aren't in a position to pay relocation so that might also be a factor."
"No way to say that a job will not not change in many aspects, including WFH.  The job could even cease to exist after a period of time."
"No way to guarantee it, but try to find out where ownership/management is on the issue. 

If ownership and managers are remote, that's a good indicator that they've instituted WFH throughout the company and that it will likely remain that way (outside of an outright sale to another firm or investment group)."
"OP, there is no way an employer is going to ""guarantee"" that a position will always be 100% WFH. If they DID guarantee WFH that would be a red flag.  Why? Because they could always eliminate the position if they wanted to go RTO and knew that the employee wouldn't do it. 

Take the job if you think it is good for you but realize that there are no guarantees in life.  At the moment, the trend is towards a hybrid work model."
"I'm not sure why everyone is mentioning an employment contract. Since here in the US, almost all levels of employment are at-will, I think the most you would see is a job offer listing the WFH. 

The biggest advantage you have? Being 350 miles from the office."
"Even with a union, my job has yearly telecommute contracts so our wfh status could change from year to year. Luckily our most recent one actually decreased required time in office (from two days to one day) but I'm anxious to see what the next one will look like."
"Most of the assurance you can get, will NOT come from them.  It will come from other things, like keeping yourself current & marketable at all times. 

&#x200B;

As far as bad things happening to your job, in my experience, usually it is being acquired.  Can you imagine if Twitter/X bought your employer?  Think your offer letter guaranteeing WFH is going to be honored by the acquirer?  No way in hell."
"This is definitely a problem.  People tend to forget that unions have to renegotiate contracts regularly.  Depending on how the general world and economy are going, I've had contracts that have lasted 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years.  This time around we have 3 years.  Unions are great, but they're not immune to outside forces, which is why I don't think there's any guarantee that you'll be able to know for sure a WFH position will always be WFH."
Not when demand for wfh jobs is at an all-time high. Plenty of applicants to choose from.
"My WFH status/contract has nothing to do with my union contract. I'm a nurse in a large hospital and have a very unicorn job of being able to WFH. Maybe 0.005% of nurses are in this role where I work, and this role was 100% on-site before the pandemic. We legit have zero in-person duties to ever see patients face to face. Everything (even pre-pandemic) is done on the computer or phone. But NO one will have sympathy for or is going to defend the nurses who get to work from home lol. Luckily my manager and two people I directly support are very supportive of WFH but I'm hearing rumblings (from a manager of a completely different department ) who thinks my team should have to RTO."
Does anyone know of a WFH job with no experience? I'm trying to get out this field.
"My company is entirely WFH and doesn't look to be changing any time soon.  Tech company still in aggressive hiring mode.  I'm on the interview team.  We literally get close to a thousand applicants for every opening posted.  

Fully WFH jobs are the most sought after perk right now, people are willing to take significant pay cuts to get this, I've read surveys saying 20% pay cuts.  You are competing with people who may have decades of experience in the exact role being advertised who want that better quality of life.  Unless you are a unicorn of a candidate your best chance is to have existing connections at companies committed to staying WFH.

And no, I'm not telling anyone my company or referring anyone for an interview."
">It's not remote work per se that creates security risks; it's a   
lack of necessary safeguards--all which a company can provide to a remote  
 employee. ""If a company provides the same protection to teleworkers as   
they do onsite workers then there is no reason to assume that   
teleworking will create data security risks,"" reads one article on employer reasons for denying remote work.

So, the concern here, though, is wage slave industries where their employee isn't making a living wage *and* is handling sensitive customer data. Obviously there is protection on the machine itself, but nothing preventing the employee from writing down the sensitive information (credit card information) and utilizing said information for their own gain.

A couple of easy solutions here: Background checks, and fucking pay your employees a living wage if they're handling sensitive data. Both cost money, and likely more money than just allowing people to work from home and taking the risk of someone stealing a customer's credit card information."
"Yeah I did the two parent working in office thing when my kids were little before WFH was an option.  One of the best days of my life was the day my youngest aged out of after school care.  

Me and my husband did staggered shifts to make it work.  I would work 6am-3pm in order to get to the school before it closed by 5pm (Boston traffic sucks).  My husband would work 9am-6pm to do morning drop offs.  

Nothing was worse than the feeling that I might be late because of an accident or other unforeseen circumstance."
"As a parent, I see this largely as the fault of the district. I WFH, but my district does dumb things like require a parent to meet the bus at the bus stop at pickup (8:40-9) and drop off (4:30-5) or they take them to the depot and you have to pick them up.

It's like they expect you to not work and just be able to stand around. I have calls at these times!

When we were kids we just walked home from school but now they treat you like you're a negligent parent if you want your kids to walk a hundred yards down a dead end road by themselves."
"Even as a WFH parent, I still block off my calendar to make sure I can get my kids to the bus and pick them up."
I don't even have children but I WFH at a remote company that spans multiple time zones. We have a super flexible policy that allows people to budget their time how they see fit outside of a few mandatory weekly meetings. Just told my new hire to make sure she blocks out her kids' drop-off/pick-up times on her calendar so no one schedules meetings over them!
"My daughter's school district eliminated buses during Covid. She's in middle school but it is not possible for her to walk home (over a mile, crossing a main road without a stop light in a dangerous spot, etc). 

There is no ""after care"" option for middle school so literally the only option is to drive her and pick her up. Thankfully I currently wfh and schedule my meetings around this (or take calls from the car) but I live in fear that I'll get laid off or forced to RTO in the next 3 years and then she's completely stranded. (After 3 years she goes to high school, which is thankfully behind our house via a walking path and no roads.) 

I don't know how parents in my town are managing it otherwise."
"WFH was such a blessing for me.  No more racing to the school to try and get there in time to avoid extra care charges, no stressing to drop off my kid the 2nd school opens so I can then race to the office.  I was able to spend 20 min RT from my house to school to pick him up in the afternoon and all I had to do was block my calendar for that time each day.  No one hassled me and I got more done since I wasn't stressing out all the time.  I got laid off in June and it was a really sh*tty time for that because there are zero remote or even 2 day in office hybrid roles out there in my industry right now.  They say ""hybrid"" but it's 4 days a week in the office with an hour + commute each way... not doing it."
"A story. 

A few years back, in the before times, we could WFH one day a week. I had very young kids, and happened to find a job that was completely remote, 5 days WFH. 

When I quit, my boss relented - ""What if you could WFH 2 days a week?"""
"Yeah I feel so fortunate that I WFH and my job is very much a ""we don't care when you work as long as it gets done"" sort of place. My husband is deployed for the second time in three years so I do all the pickups and drop offs. Sometimes that means I'm finishing a work report at 10 pm, but I'll take that deal any day of the week.

Basically my job treats me like a grown up and I wish everyone had that."
"When my kids were young and I was in the office, most of my PTO went to juggling this stuff. School is close to home kind of by definition, so anything involving your kids requires you to drive all over town to pick them up and take them somewhere. A half-hour doctor's appointment ends up taking you away from work for half a day. Surely the ability to WFH benefits both employer and employee?"
"We have 4 kids, and both myself and my wife are full-time.  My wife WFH, I'm in-office (by choice), but fortunately I have a lot of flexibility on when I work so it hasn't been as big an issue for us.  Ironically, my wife's WFH job is way more picky about when she works whereas if I need to leave early for whatever reason I can just go."
Jealous of people who actually have school buses. I WFH and I don't know how I'd do it otherwise. We live in So Cal where we pay ridiculous taxes and still don't get school bus service.
"I WFH but we are expected to keep set hours, kids or not. I will say I resented being the person who always had to work because of my choice of not having children. Working the medical job we have, we are expected to WFH just like we do if we were in the office, no children wandering around, and you are totally focused on your job for the hours you work. I have absolutely no issue with that. There's no way people could be in and out whenever they wanted doing what we do though. Lives depend on us."
"My daughter has a 3mo old. Her biggest issue was asking her employer for a wfh role. She got it and a bump in pay and no daycare.  I had full custody of her at 8. My routine was simple. Up at 5, quick treadmill and email/projects.  Bfast/bus pick up at which time I'd ask people I knew didn't work if they let her stay with them until I got home around 6pm.  Dinner, homework, etc.  when she went to sleep, back to email until 11-12, repeat.  If she had a game, I'd take off to go (luckily my boss was flexible). Weekends were hers until she went to sleep, then work.  I don't regret it. Stalled my career as I couldn't jump on a plane without notice, but wouldn't trade it for anything."
"Sometimes I do feel a little guilty.. just a little, compared to some of my colleagues. I've got an extremely flexible role with a manager that is very open-minded / progressive.  Not so common in a commercial Bank.

So while many of us have jobs that are officially hybrid, the actual implementation varies by a wide degree. In my case, 100% flexibility to make my own hours and pick my location , but I don't really need this perk being single, no kids, and live 10 miles from the office... Meanwhile one of my work friends who reports to a different team now lives 20 mi further away from the office and has a manager who will give can I pass an aggressive hard time if he tries to squeeze an extra WFH day in the week for a very valid reason (like prepping his kid for weekend soccer tryouts)."
"At my last job, precovid, I would come in at 8am, eat lunch at my desk and never take breaks. Breaks outside of grabbing food, water or bathroom...you get the idea. I would leave everyday around 3:45 to get my kid which was a 30min drive away. I always got asked every ""review"" time why I can't be in my desk until at least 5pm, it sends a bad message. Are you kidding me? My previous bosses were fine with it, but this MF was a real old school POS. 

I also heard many conversations about people who left for lunch and how they didn't have enough work to do if they could afford to not eat at their desk. 

Definitely a toxic work environment!

New job was way more flexible on time spent in the seat because I got my job done. We've been WFH since Covid and I hope every single day we never go back. The added stress of rushing to the bus or school, then reversed at the end of day is crazy."
Yeah honestly gov must mandate that people who don't require to be onsite must have an option to WFH. That by itself would solve a huge portion of childcare crisis
"Why should parents get more flexibility in scheduling than people that don't have kids?  Nobody forced them to have children.  People with chronic illnesses or disabled spouses would benefit from just as much flexibility.

When I worked for Thompson Reuters pre pandemic, they required WFH people to have childcare because the company didn't want them taking work time taking care of their kids instead of working."
"Corporate America is designed for the man.  As lifestyles have changed over the past 60 years the corporate system in America has not changed but demands on women have.  It is next to impossible to be a mom and full time employee.  WFH doesn't fix this because so many companies refuse to be flexible. 

I was going through back to school photos of my kids and was sad over the missing year. That was the year my boss refused to let me come in a half hour late so I could see my children off to school. She only said no because she could and I had to oblige because I needed my job.  That's how corporate America treats women especially moms. Where I work now I can get paid to volunteer at my kid's school, up to 3 days a year."
"Not just the USA...

I gave birth 5,5 months ago, in Belgium. Maternity and parental leave are wonderful.

But I was refused WFH when I had hyperemesis. It was severaly agravated by my commute, and led to me having to take half days off and sick days. My OB had medical paperwork, but instead of WFH they said I either had to be in office and hand over whatever work I couldn't do to a colleague or be at home in sick leave for the rest of the pregnancy. Guess what happened...

Due to the stress of dealing with a shit ton of paperwork, the now suddenly appearing money issues, and thinking of potentially being fired because of how I was treated I went into preterm labour at 32 weeks and delivered at 35.

I finally return to work and get hit with overtime straight away, no communication about changes in my role, about flex-desking all of a sudden...

And the best thing? We get under 1 day a week (may be up to 2 now but haven't been able to check the rules yet) to WFH. Like, they want us in 100% but can't do it due to the unions.

This is a very well known international company too, who had been trying but failing so far to get a foot in in America. The Navy does their job there and does it so well they can't get a foothold just yet. Not the kind of company I personally was expecting to pull shit like this..."
"Unpopular opinion but....

I love WFH. I've been doing it for six years now. I take it just as seriously as when I worked in the office; probably more so. Yes, I enjoy greater flexibility, but only when it's not an issue. I never plan on taking my kids to school because I never know in advance whether or not a work thing will require my attention.

I have coworkers who went WFH during COVID who don't share my opinion on WFH and I hate working with them. They aren't responsive during the day, nobody seems to know where they are, they miss meetings, they just generally aren't working. The biggest, most obvious, example is people who are parenting while also working. 

Even way back in 2005; I worked at a company that used to allow 1-day WFH but too many people abused it. So they stopped it completely. That's how I feel now. 

Too many people are doing a crappy job with WFH."
The issue is it brought to light the actual benefits WFH provided to families or anyone really. The need for change.
"  Not who you replied to. But I did the evening and weekend shit jobs, while my husband worked daytime hours, because 20+ years ago, it was that or daycare,and my job wasn't paying enough to break even. It sucked. I'm still surprised we made it through that. 

  I now work in a very small 5 person office. We have one lady who bitches and complains all the time, that the 2 with young kids gets to flex their time. They can wfh, come into the office, but leave early for their kids. 

  Her reasons..because she didn't get to do that with her kids,so no one else should. Except she gets the same flex/hybrid time as myself and the young parents. 

  I'm just happy about the fact that there is now an alternative to what I did."
"That's a hard one! I'm in ed tech and our (large-ish) company was fully remote pre-pandemic, so there was no office culture to ""return to."" Before this job I was full-time freelance/contract so remote work was non-negotiable for me...I was eventually head-hunted by a former client for this role. 

So maybe the key is looking for companies that were already full remote pre-pandemic? And that have employees located across the country, because that in itself demands time flexibility."
Maybe start your own company and make it WFH for all of your staff then.
"I absolutely LOVE WFH.  When I was remote when my daughter was very young, she was in daycare.  I find the office to be more distracting, especially chatty coworkers.  At home, it's just the radio and the sound of pets snoring."
"You gotta have a separate room with a door to use as your home office and a partner who respects ""don't interrupt me between these hours"".    Without either of those it's a major challenge"
Do you have any recommendations for teachers who want to get into ed tech? I am very handy with using technology but unfortunately I never picked up any programing skills. I'm just super burned out by having to be on every single second I'm at school and I'd love a WFH job
"I can't imagine having a puppy and not having a WFH job.  Potty training would've been so stressful.  

I take mine out for a walk at lunchtime every day and it's SO NICE to be able to do that."
"  Only time I've ever been bitter that people could work from home and I couldn't was during covid. My previous employer swore I couldn't do my job remote,  when literally 98% of my coworkers were either remote or came in one day a week. 

  And I wasn't bitter toward my coworkers, I was just bitter that my employer didn't understand my job enough to figure out I didn't need to be there. 

  I got bitter and started looking for a new job when I got sick (not covid), and could not make it in for work. Call in, and don't you know it...I had laptops and monitors delivered to my house within an hour of me calling in. Guess I could work from hone after all."
Given that having kids is a contemplated decision.  Can I afford this working my normal job?   Do I have enough savings to afford to have a child if I want to stay home and parent versus work.   It's not easy being an adult but we all knew that WFH was only temporary.  It kinda is time to return to normal since the pandemic is in the past.
"Let me tell you.....I have a toddler.... when he was about 2 he had a ROUGH day... crap sleep the night before, pissy mood... terrible day; FINALLY fell asleep for a nap about 10 min before I had to pick up my first grader....I live 1/2 mile.... my WFH computer auto times out at 4 min.....I could leave and pick her up and get home before the system auto times out.... super fast. 

So this day I didn't want to wake him.... and left him sleeping in a crib he couldn't climb out of; behind a child locked door he couldn't open....2 locked baby gates he couldn't open....a camera directly ON HIM that I could watch on my phone. And 6 more cameras in my home to watch every move. And under the watchful eyes of my 130lb Cane Corso downstairs in the living room. 

The school didn't see him in the car and assumed he was alone.... he was... and called CPS who then promptly showed up at my house. 

I told CPS the law in Texas is ""there is no age limit as long as said child is under proper supervision or responsibility"". There is no violation since I can show on camera I was away from the home for a shorter time then it took to walk to the corner and back (mailboxes) AND he was under camera surveillance. 

She said the school admin are idiots and need to mind their own business. Then I reported the school for false reporting."
"Why do people always lead with the fact they are looking for a WFH job?
It shows how ignorant people are.

WFH is not a job type. You can't look for a WFH job. It's not a thing.

WFH is a location. You are saying you want help finding a work location. That's just ignorant.

You need to search for a job with the skills you have. So clerical.
And then you look for clerical jobs that offer remote work locals.

That's how that works.

Look for the job first. Find one you like.
Then see if they offer remote.

You are literally doing it backwards.

Why is this so hard to understand?"
"Don't give them any more than you feel they compensate you for. We should not have to give up anything in order to have the right to work from home. In fact, in many cases they should pay us more if we are more productive when working from home. They're getting more output for the same wages, or in fact even lower operating costs because they're not funding the daily operation of an office space.

I've been WFH for years, I am being paid *better* in my WFH job and always have. Compromising on anything in exchange for WFH benefits is a mistake, and a slippery slope that leads to employers paying us less because they can see that we are fearful of losing our job if we stand up for ourselves. Stand up for yourself, and if that's the hill they want to die on then you can take your talents to one of their competitors who is willing to let you work where you choose with no tradeoff."
You say that because you're not affected. Most people won't risk their jobs just to work from home. Take it or leave it doesn't work well when you're the employee. They can always find other people to fill in your shoes. Just be grateful you're working from home permanently like me! Lol.
"At this point it should be expected to travel while wfh. One of the biggest advantages to wfh is the flexibility. You could just be honest and say you're out of town visiting family. There's nothing wrong with that if you can keep the same work hours. Like others have mentioned, after work activities are not mandatory when it's during your personal time. The ""team"" dinners should be scheduled when everyone on the team is available. Just be honest."
"Get accommodations to wfh now! They should easily be approved since you're at home anyway. There's no undue hardship on the company. If you wait, you'd have to worry about accommodations getting approved."
Get a doctor to write you a letter that you need to work from home exclusively and submit to HR.
"Well you can do what I did and just not go in. They asked about it and I said yeah no I'm not going to sorry, I'm still willing to work from home. And so I continue to.

I was prepared for any and all consequences but had a pretty good idea that they wouldn't fire me for it since being on site is not really a requirement of my job *at all* and they have a hard time finding and keeping good talent. If they find someone better to replace me eventually then so be it, I'll move on.

The worse part was that they announced RTO a month beforehand and it really stressed me out the whole time waiting and I kept imagining what would happen. It's much better once whatever is going to happen does happen and you actually know where you're at."
"You are being far more loyal to your job than it is to you.

My recommendation would be to move now, rather than later. Staying in your lease might end up costing you the ability to work from home. 

Do a cost benefit analysis: cost of breaking your lease vs cost of commuting to the office every week. I somehow doubt $2-3K to break your lease is going to outweigh the cost of going RTO."
"The only time (prepandemic) that I ever had to justify working from home was when I was in sales and commuting into San Francisco from the East Bay. My sales team was the lucky recipients of a new manager. 

He was not okay with me doing Admin from home in the mornings. Yet It was better for ME to avoid peak traffic, so I WFH'ed for my admin and drove in at 930-10 for client meetings. I explained this, he wouldn't budge. Wanted me to go in the SF office in the mornings. So I asked my manager ride with me one morning to see that it was not time efficient to commute in at 630. It took us two hours to get over the bridge that day he rode with me (commute was not typically that long, but the bad traffic worked in my favor that day) and he was like, yeah, you're right, you're better off driving in at 930. Yeah buddy.

Ask your manager to carpool with you one day and see your commute."
"Maybe you could arrange to move away while there's no mandate. 

Several people at my company did that and they have been allowed to stay 100% remote. 

One thing I will caution you about -- my company first said they would like it if we would come in once per month and that we'd be able to continue WFH.  And because it was only going to be once per month -- I moved out to the suburbs. 

Well, literally the week I was OOO moving -- they announced mandatory 3 days per week RTO."
"Is there a way to ask for WFH without revealing your identity to someone who might use this inquiry against you?

Like, leave an anonymous comment at the CEO's desk, or just leave a message with your boss and ask that your name not be bused in connection with your request."
"It totally sucks. I think I waited too long to ask. We're a tech company, on my team we're all on the software development side. We worked very easily and remained very productive while fully wfh during covid. They've mandated a hybrid schedule now, but word is they will be increasing the number of in-office days soon. Currently 2-3 depending on which office. I've got still about ten years left until retirement; cannot imagine spending the rest of my career schlepping into an office. Hated it before covid, hate it now. Wishing you better luck, hope things work out for you."
"I would agree with this. I'm at a company where 95% of workers have had to RTO 3 days a week.  I have been able to maintain my WFH status simply by virtue of the fact that I am located in Arizona while the majority of my team is in Charlotte.  If you can, I'd move while the option is still available to you. 

You do need to make a brutally honest assessment of how indispensible you are.  Once a company gets serious about RTO, they will look at people who are not co-located with their peers and one of the options is to let those people go and hire local replacements.  Hiring is hard and the more specialized you are, the more hesitant the company is going to be to do this.  But its a risk.  In my view its a risk worth taking to maintain WFH, but you should factor it into your cash emergency fund and other financial planning."
"> I'm wondering if it's worth roping in the boss' boss. He also is pretty remote friendly, but I think upper management kind of needs to ""encourage"" people to come in.

I don't know about your company -- but that's how I got my WFH exception. It took the better part of the year and an insane amount of effort by my Director.  And for me, and in **my** company -- it took a Director to get an exception.

Many others have tried and failed. Most people just quit (we had a mass exodus over RTO).

I was just optimistic about your situation because you don't yet have an RTO mandate to fight.

Edit:  oh, but the support network issue was key in getting **my** exception approved."
"Yeah, the mandate isn't there yet so maybe I ask this week. I'm just so afraid to. I'd fight for it. I can show how good I am and my boss knows it. I'm just afraid they'll immediately try to replace me - which is just anxiety speaking I think. My direct report and her boss are pretty relaxed about WFH. I remember one of my first conversations with my boss was making fun of the crappy lunches they offer us as an incentive to get in. 

Do I put some kind of report together noting all I've done with them? Do I keep it sort of relaxed? Just not sure how to approach. And I guess being in peak season right now as the company isn't doing great and everything's breaking down, I wonder if it's the best time. Just afraid all the time as a product of my anxiety and how badly joblessness affected me in 2020"
"Yeah. You're right. I guess the sooner the better to ask, despite all the peak season craziness? 

I guess I'm not worried by boss or her boss would outright fire me. Just the fear of not having work is huge too. I'm always fearful of the corporate landscape, I guess. 

But yeah, living here is so hard. I'm completely alone and been in office under 10-15 times since being here 2.5 years. Plus yeah, I'm in school. 

I would suck up an office mandate if I had to for a few months. Although honestly I'd rather be re classified as remote here overall. But maybe that's asking too much? We have 215 Florida remote workers on our directory and about 500 assigned to the office. So it's not equal but it's not nothing. I'd just really like the certainty of being WFH. That was what was in the initial posting, although it doesn't matter now. But again I fear it's too much. Maybe I can leverage grad school.

Don't know. I've just been so afraid and timid to do anything to risk my job. But I can't be up nightly like this anymore"
This is a WFH question why? Does this not happen to you when you have to go someto work?
"You've already received great advice (cut down on the carbs, increase fresh air). I found it really interesting when I got a carbon dioxide monitor and can now see how quickly carbon dioxide builds up in my home office. It can happen very fast, especially if I'm leading a meeting and doing a lot of talking. The C02 buildup makes me sleepy and makes it harder to think clearly. My monitor prompts me to open the window and door regularly and refresh the air even when it's cold and I naturally want the room sealed up so I can heat it. It makes a huge difference."
"Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice.

It's normal to feel tired after eating. 

Sometimes there can be a medical condition at play. 

For me though; I actually stopped eating lunch while WFH or I do like a really clean protein shake without a lot of sugar. I was having the exact same issue after eating lunch, being sedentary and it was causing me to be overwhelmingly tired. 

My wife also WFH and she will go take a walk after lunch, like someone else suggested already in the comments."
"I work in insurance and my degree is in statistics. I started in the claims department with my company in January 2020 and then March came and we were all sent home. At the time, there was a lot of talk about being downsized so I freaked out and I applied to a sales position within the company because it was a work from home position. I interviewed for the position and got it 2 days later. I ended up loving the position and made tripled my previous salary which doesn't say much but I had been out of work for over a year and was desperate so it took the job. 

There are tons of sales jobs that are also work from home because technically you do not need an office to be productive. I ended up in inbound sales up until August of this year so I was in IB for almost a year. I recently got promoted to a chat sales department where I am still selling insurance but I do it via chat. I like this position much more because I get paid to sit on my ass and chat with people who are interested in buying auto/home/mc/boat/pup etc, policy's. Needless to say the job can be done at home so I never have to return back to an office. There are so many benefits of working from home. My company even pays for my internet and my cellphone bill. They give me $80/month to pay for it. They also sent me all brand new equipment for the position. 2 24"" Dell monitors, computer, keyboard, mouse, video camera and a headset, all brand new so I didn't have to spend my own money. However, I did upgrade my setup to a 29"" uw because my role needs more screen RE and I purchased wireless keyboard, mice, and headset. 

If you can find a sales job with a good company they will give you the same things. I don't know of many work from home jobs with your background so you may have to either choose sales or a job you can do remotely. You can always start in sales to get your foot in the door and then change positions later on. I know that's how a lot of people in my original class did. They started in sales and then ended up in different positions throughout the company. That's the easiest way. 

What kind of job were you interested in?"
"I have a degree in teaching and just got a job offer to WFH after applying all over for less than a month. I am going to be working as a Financial Aid Specialist for a college. Essentially, it is like a call center job, but it is inbound, so I won't be calling out. I also don't have to deal with products at all. Just troubleshooting student financial questions. 

During the interview process, they said that they really valued my previous work with students, and thought that I was a great fit. 

I am making about half of what I was making as a teacher. It is entry level, so I am pretty much starting from the bottom. However, when I was looking for jobs that were WFH, I know that I had to seriously adjust my expectations. My goal now is to work my way up."
"Hey, you might be able to help me! I got my undergrad in psych, but after working all the hands-on, soul-crushing, horribly paid psych jobs in my rural area, I decided for a career change. 

I did a semester of business classes (a payroll tech certificate but mostly just beginning business and computer classes) and was wondering if there are any WFH jobs out there for me, with my weird experience and schooling. I don't *really* want to go back to school, but if getting a masters degree could guarantee me a good job for once, I'll do it. I actually make less money now than I did before obtaining a degree, and its slowly killing my spirit, lol. I live in a rural area, so there aren't many choices. 

Basically, do you (or anyone here) know of any remote jobs which could use a BA in psych and some basic business knowledge? Can anyone think of anything that might suit me? I would love to get into HR, but honestly it seems the best way to get into that is through experience, not schooling, and I haven't been able to find any HR assistant positions."
This is why WFH is ending.
"Nah brah. Wfh is ending bc of greedy institutions that are interested in gouging and fucking over the lower classes (i.e., us) in order to reassert their power dynamic."
"Heya! This is impressive. I know it's for remote work but I'd still love to find a job with a HQ in the country I live in, is a location filter planned?"
Thank you! Just passed it on to three folks who are seeking a great WFH career.
"I agree. Usually the employer should cover your setup expenses. Of course the a limit. I'm from Europe, so I can't talk about the US, but is there maybe a way to use the WFH costs for tax deduction?

For example I can deduct parts of my electricity and Internet costs from my taxes, as they are viewed as being required for the job, which makes sense when you think about it."
This company has fully embraced WFH and frequently comments on the talent they've gained from switching to full WFH.
"I'm 200% more productive WFH, it's not even close 

&#x200B;

No commute gives me much more energy to start the day and the same lack of commute makes it easier for me to stay on a little later past 5p if needed 

&#x200B;

when I was in office I'd bounce right at 5p to try and beat some traffic"
"If this is the same article I read the other day look into the study. They took entry level customer service/call centers and decided that was representative of wfh, which is obviously not true."
"Right? This is my problem with a lot of these research papers that try to measure things that are as nebulous and hard to define as ""productivity', which are full of nuance and variation. It shows in their supposed ""10-20%"" decrease in productivity, a figure thrown around like some overall truth about remote work in general. This fake journalism needs to be called out every time."
"Interesting PM segment there, thanks for sharing. But the cited study that singles out ""productivity"" as a metric, in terms of measured work output over a select span of time, could miss the mark on the more complex matrix of productivity, time, cost, and retention. Do remote workers remain with those companies longer? Does that mean less training of new hires is required, and more braintrust is retained if employees are happier and staying longer? (Our anecdotal guess is ""yes"" based on other studies and data we've pored through.)

This Planet Money podcast also mentions some difficulty about collaborating, training, and mentoring while working remotely. Full disclosure: We agree with some of those issues, and this account does represent a company of ex-game devs making a new remote work collaboration app that, yep, solves for those; more info in our Reddit bio if you are curious."
Totally. And I also feel like productivity is down everywhere from Covid how it is just a work from home issue. People run with the headlines and abuse statistics
"I thought it was interesting how while they ""found"" a 10% reduction in output it could be made up in other ancillary areas, such as real estate costs. Or in longer employment like you reference. 

The 10% reduction for WFH is about what I found for my own employees when I looked at our metrics. Turnover for us has been low and doesn't seem to have been impacted by WFH, hybrid or office, but we are a small company and I wouldn't consider us representative. 

I also tend to lean a little left and felt this podcast didn't have an agenda, like many on both sides of the argument assume when a study doesn't go in their preferred direction."
"Be very available, during your ordinary office hours. Perception of presence is important, in-office or remote.

In-office, you can slack off at your desk, ignore phone calls, brush people off with a furrowed brow as if you're deep in concentration. But you're there, your presence is tangible.

WFH, you can be at your desk all day, diligently working away, but if you ignore a call because you don't want to break your flow at a task, for all the other person knows you're on the couch watching a movie. So pick up every call, respond to every request. 

There is trust being extended to you to manage yourself. Actively maintain it."
"Super easy going and laid back. No one looking over my shoulder constantly or micromanaging. No one cares if I'm not right on time in the morning or if my lunch break is 15 minutes longer than it should be. As long as the work gets done, my supervisor is extremely hands off. Edit: I know all wfh jobs aren't like this. I'm lucky. Etiquette-Definitely don't call for something that could've been a message."
"I want to say that its also important that you ask this question on ""what is normal/healthy"" for remote work just because I had worked at the beginning of the pandemic remotely with the idea that I should be as accommodating and available as possible to my boss. I will say, it was a new experience for my boss too. But this remote work situation did not pan out well because it was with someone who was micromanagin, lived alone, and wanted me sitting on zoom calls for the 8+ hours that I was doing work for them. This became an unhealthy dynamic very quickly. The flipside was I was glad this wasnt an in-person job, and that I was going to quit the job remotely. It wasn't until I talked to others that I learned that remote work wasnt usually with zoom on 100% of the time, but generally was only used for meetings and such. So yes, definitely learn what it is that helps to keep a balance, and not get abused in the work dynamic."
" No work culture that not a thing with WFH  as lease with my experience, once the time to log off , you done with work

Etiquette wise make professional in chat and learn to let something slides when other are not."
If you wanted genuine relationships and a real sense of company culture then you wouldn't WFH. It's all fake. Like when you have to take a sick day... but your already home and you can prob still just look at your computer. The whole trend is a mess. A mess. It's doing more damage to us then we know.
"Don't be an asshole to people by assuming you know everything. 

If you follow that, you'll do just great at WFH. Others, maybe not so much."
Agreed. I'm a huge proponent of WFH whenever it's possible. But it has to be a two-way street.
"I've actually found it easier to build relationships. People I would normally just email or call on the phone are now connecting with me from their home office on a video feed. There's often exchanges talking about more personal things - the books on their shelf, the cat jumping on the desk etc."
"> No work culture that not a thing with WFH as lease with my experience

Sounds like a shit job, or your completly disconnected from your cowrokers & your a shit employee. 

This is precisely the crap those wanting people back into the office site as a reason, people disconnecting because they are remote."
"Hey -- you're throwing thr person good advice, but it's tied to me comment. I don't want to get into a whole ""but virtual happy hours are real"" back and forth with you so let's just end this here. I'm glad you enjoy WFH. I don't. But we each have our own thing and that's cool!"
"I have never felt ""connected"" to my employer.  It is a job. It pays my bills.  Its ""mission"" is to make money, and I'm good at assisting in that mission.  Period.

All of these RTO and WFH articles are nothing more than politics.  Our rulers want to go back to normal - that includes pretending Covid is gone - and getting everyone on the road and into offices again.  The gaslighting will only get worse as Covid gets worse, on the rise again right now (but let's still pretend it doesn't exist, even though I personally know 5 people with it in the past couple of weeks, and it is, again, circulating throughout the office)."
"I'd say the only people who think ANY employee gives a flying fuck about their company's mission (in office, hybrid, or wfh) also thinks their own farts smell good.  God how I wish all this HR-derived nonsense like mission statements, corporate vision, values, etc.  would just die."
"Make sure you check in with your direct supervisor to discuss what you're expected. Hours are. You want to be online when they expect you to be.

Ask about the calendar policy for my company. My calendar is updated so everyone can see it. I had my lunch on there. Schedule your breaks as well.

It's okay to do like a load of laundry, but don't be taking the whole day off to go watch a movie or something like that. It's not worth it.

When you get assigned projects, make sure you ask all questions up front. Then ask for some check-in time 15-20 minutes in a day or two or in the middle of the project to make sure You are on the right track.

When you wfh you have to ask a lot more questions. You have to make a lot more effort to stay connected to your boss and your co-workers. Have a regular scheduled check-in and make sure you have new projects, existing projects, training and ask what is expected of you.

Be proactive and ask who you should be meeting with too in the beginning to get to know people and what your job is

Good luck! Hope this works out for you"
"Nice! All that stuff just makes for a more fulfilling lifestyle. What kind of writing?

Wfh has its own challenges too - for me getting outside in the morning first thing, having some kind of routine to wake you up and get you feeling good before work really helps, as well as getting off the screens for breaks. Otherwise the day can start to blur together"
No. All of my friends work from home as well.
"Lol I am in HR and luckily my boss is not lkke that at all. She ks for wfh, in fact SHRM bas studies to support it... but thr Board and leadership likes us to deliver bad messages so we are the bad guy"
"I have been the wife in this situation and I didn't work not because I had no skills (I have many many skills, both occupational and other) but because I was going through some pretty severe mental health issues relating to work. So remember there are many reasons why wives (or any partner) might not be working at a time.

Tbh, we actually were just as well off when I wasn't working: our quality of life was great due to me being happier and able to cook healthy meals and send him with lunches. I could do laundry and chores early in the day to save money, I was aware of all of our expenditures so we weren't wasting money. I made apple butter for all our friends from our apple tree and grew lots of other foods which made me happy. I also did a lot of side work. Anyway. 

*sigh* I miss it. 

Also, I do not work remotely but I'm here because it's my dream to wfh and I am jealous of you all! But happy for you as well "
"Treat your WFH schedule just as you would in the office.  You're at work, and work gets breaks.  Schedule it with an alarm or a timer if you need to, to get in the habit.  Mark your lunch break on your calendar, so others know as well."
"When I leave the house I'm ""ooo."" If I'm taking a bathroom break, getting water, or answering FedEx/UPS at the door, I'm getting paid. Believe me, I'd fuck around tons more in a cube farm, just to see how much I could get away with before being reprimanded (yeah, I'm one of ""those"".) With WFH I'm much more respectful of getting work done, I'm not micro-managed. Any ""meetings"" are well thought out and not wasteful.  I get the work done and fill in the gaps as I can/have access to. 

I care now and I work more now, put me in a back cube and you won't like the outcome."
"Salaried, WFH here.  Personal errands, groceries, tanning, etc... I run during lunch.  Doctor's appointments, etc...I take when I can get them.  As long as our team lead is aware and it's on our calendars it's no issue."
No one does this. And these posts are bait to ruin WFH for those of us that work.
"My new cat helped me solve this problem. Previously I was eating at my desk while WFH and not really taking a full lunch. New kitty wants to have his nose in Mommy's food when she sits at her desk. I'm now going into the kitchen to eat where I stand at the counter and listen to an audio book.

I'm away from my desk, eating in peace and relaxing a bit. It's grand."
"I believe that strong communication is the key.  Just like people step away from their desks to go to meetings, take breaks, and have lunch...the same behaviors apply to WFH.  We use MS Teams and we encourage staff to use the Status function when they are stepping away from work.  We also use cameras and have frequent touch points.

I also advise my WFH staff to carefully document their work to demonstrate that they are every bit as successful wfh than in the office.  I work in tech so it is pretty easy to quantify results (documentation developed, function points coded, test scripts executed, projects on time, etc).  By showing their progress and accomplishment, it removes all doubt that the work is not being done.  This will also help you justify to yourself that you are doing all your work and more...and ease any guilt about flexing your schedule during the day."
"My apartment is so much cleaner since I started WFH lol. Anytime I need a little break I do a some vacuuming, the dishes, toss a load of laundry in, etc."
"I don't get a lot out of social interactions through work. I like the people I work with, but I'm kind of just there to make money. So I prefer to have activities outside of work that enrich my life. I am in a musical group, I am a member of a volunteer organization in the community, stuff like that. I am also a member of a group for remote workers in the area that meets up from time to time. 
My suggestion would be to think about what you're interested in, and find a way to get together with a group of people who like the same thing. If you don't already follow the subreddit for your community, that's a great way to see what's going on!"
I became a hermit during WFH and now have like way less friends than I used to. It's great.
"I quit my job during the pandemic. We were WFH at the time. I resigned via video call and came in for half a day on my last day to say goodbye and turn my stuff in. 

You could plan to Uber to the office to drop your stuff off if driving isn't a feasible option that day. 

I have anxiety too but I found that since leaving my old job, that anxiety is less and less. Good luck!!"
"I don't know why I'm responding because I just started to work from home for a little over a year so I'm not sure how to comfort you. I would say stop worrying right now and cross that bridge when You get there. Why are you even worried about this now? Like you said, you use your own equipment and the only thing you have is a thumb drive. A thumb drive can be mailed back to your employer if need be. Also, your manager should know about your anxiety of driving by now. If you had to go into the office I would suggest ordering an Uber/Lyft for those days that they ask you to go in. If your manager knows that you're quitting and have a thing about driving then they should not make you go in. Plus, if they did after you told them about your personal issue then I would quit on the spot. You're leaving the company and giving them 3 weeks to find a replacement which is ample time. Are you planning on going back if your new job doesn't work out? I'd say for your sanity, stop worrying about it now and deal with it when the situation comes up. Depending on how loyal you are the worst thing that can happen is they make you go in for an ""exit interview"" then order a taxi or Uber to get there. Depends on how much effort you want to put in for the last 3 weeks with them. I'm sorry if it's not what you want to hear! I hope it helps. Good luck!"
"I get it pal. Any normal human being is going to take your problems into account regardless of whether it's a mental health issue or not. You could simply tell your boss you don't have a car and you don't know how to get there and play dumb. Since you've never mentioned it let him decide what he wants you to do but I doubt he'll force you to go in at this point. He sounds like a reasonable person to allow you to work from home all this time. Don't be scared or worried, pal. What happens is meant to happen. Just have faith that GOD will take care of you and your needs. If it happens then it's meant to happen so there's no sense worrying about it now. Good luck with your conversation and stop worrying about things out of your control!"
"Good places to look are reputable online job boards like RatRaceRebellion.  There are also a couple of huge WFH groups on Facebook that post regularly with job openings within well known companies around the country.  
Keep in mind, though, that depending on who you are working for will depend what state you can work in and since you will have to pay taxes it will eventually come out if you're in a state that a company doesn't hire in.  So always be sure to find out if you're able to move while employed and what states they allow workers to be in so you don't run into an issue."
"You can get an entry level IT/CSR job with that they start at around 60k, my buddy did it a few years ago, I might get my certification too and do it. The WFH, no commute seems like the move."
"I'm in the same boat as you, single and WFH. I talk to friends and coworkers during the day. I can multitask!"
"Get on clubhouse. Even if it's just for background noise, but ideally you would also find communities you enjoy and want to engage with. Make some wfh clubhouse buddies."
"Omg! I've been working from home since April! And although my hubby also wfh it's been crazy lonely. I found a Therapist, back on my anti depressants. I'm legit having to force myself to leave the house and see friends!"
Can you share with me the discord link as well? Only been WFH for a yeah and already feel depressed :/
"A big red flag with your post is that you had a Telegram interview. This ""job"" was 99% likely a scam and they're quite abundant right now because so many people are looking for WFH jobs. On Indeed and Zip Recruiter you can search for remote positions but read the job postings carefully because many companies are posting jobs as ""remote"" or ""work from home"" to get applicants. If I see a job posting that is misleading like that, I report it. That being said, there are websites that cater to WFH and those are FlexJobs, We Work Remotely, and Rat Race Rebellion. Flexjobs has remote, hybrid, and contract jobs but you have to pay a membership fee to use it. We Work Remotely and Rat Race Rebellion are free to use. Best of luck, I am actively searching for a WFH job right now. I have one pretty much nailed in but it's only a temporary gig and doesn't start until the Summer. I really need something else before that as well, so I'm still looking."
"I posted this on another post but just reposting it in case this helps at all!

Just in case this helps you or anyone at all!

I do work as a Claims Call Center Specialist I for National General Insurance. It is a remote position (I'm not sure if you have to be in specific states or not so if anything just keep that in mind) where they shipped all the equipment to me. I do also get an $80 reimbursement for internet monthly which is standard for all work from home employees to get. The pay rate could vary based on experience (I'm not 100% sure if it does matter if you've had any previous call center experience so that is something to also possibly keep in mind.), But for me I get paid $20 per hour and get a 10% shift differential for being on a schedule that starts after 10:30 AM which has me making $22.11 per hour in total. It is only a full time position as they do not allow part time for this position. They do also pay while you are training which for me was I believe just 2-3 weeks where they paid the full $20 per hour with no shift differential since that started at 10:00 AM. But, it is possible that the pay during training will be a smaller amount. And the same thing goes for the pay rate of this position, I had 9 months of call center experience prior to working here so it is very possible that experience helps with the pay rate, but I've never questioned about it so I truly don't know. And also if you stay with them for at least a year, then you become eligible to apply for different positions within the company where, for example, if you wanted to become a licensed claims adjuster, (this is something my manager told me so it is possible this could have changed, so also keep that in mind as well) they would pay fully for the training it takes to get that done and also handles paying for you to renew your license yearly (I believe).

And make sure you pm me if you do decide to do this since we do have a referral program.



Also, you can work for the company Sitel Inc. for Capital One."
"In wake of all the RTO, I've still been seeing jobs I've been applying to that embrace remote working, even some asynchronous work, and want to give employees the option to have that work life balance. Granted they are probably fewer than jobs demanding RTO, but there are still people out there running companies that actually understand that we don't have to be shackled to a corporate desk and have our faces visible in an office building to get work done."
"**Thank you for sharing it OP. What a great blog, everyone should read it!** It's well written and thoughtful of the nuance. They actually adapt to WFH and avoid popular pitfalls that are being repeated in RTO talking-points.

**Pasted some highlights below.**""it struck me as one of the most clearly insane things we force humans to do on a daily basis - spend an average of 20% of their waking hours driving or on public transport. Many people report that the first 2 hours after waking are their most productive; are we really asking them to spend those precious hours commuting? It does make some sense from the companies perspective, because the company doesn't pay for this time, nor do they usually directly pay for the cost of the commute (which can often take a hefty chunk out of your wage).""

""There's a large portion of the population who fit this description, and without casting any negative judgement, we have to be open and honest with candidates that if they're in this camp - they'll likely be unhappy working at Supabase. In the early days we thought that these people could adapt, or perhaps be able to satisfy their need for face to face interactions outside of work, but on the whole it wasn't the case. We actively try to reduce the number of meetings happening across the company (both in person and via video call) which increases friction with these folks. By not supporting this group, we're reducing the size of the population from which we can hire, but overall our hiring pool is still very much larger than the average in-person company.... **After all, the goal of hiring should be to source the absolute best person for the job. Statistically speaking it's unlikely that this person lives within an hour drive to your office.**""

""... Another huge benefit of hiring from anywhere is that you end up with an incredibly diverse team. This helps when selling to a global audience of developers, and ensures diversity of thought and a broad range of perspectives.""

""When you save so much on office space it extends the budget for whole company off-sites (on-sites?). **At the end of the day we're all human, and we know the importance of getting to know your team mates on a human level. That's why once per year we get everyone together for 11 days. This year we went to Bali.**""

**""A lot of people's hesitations around remote seem to stem from not having trust in their team to get things done without adult supervision. However, if I know anything about high performing teams, it's that you need to have mutual trust (which breeds psychological safety), and a shared model of what success looks like (metrics anyone?). Without these you're going to struggle to produce results office or no office.""**"
"A smart, well run company, the ViRtuAl BaD mob  is likely  getting out the  pitchforks.   These loons are willing to endure more traffic, pollution, and higher gas prices  plus  impose  all that on the rest of us who must  commute, but are  not  asshats, just to make remote workers  suffer too its sick. 

Really good news  that some companies are resisting  the rto lunacy hopefully that trend continues til the landlords go broke or find other ways to fund their yacht addiction. Once  the bribe, money drys up , the politicians will shut up"
"I currently am WFH in CA. Our company has employees working remote all over the country. I'm also in payroll/hr. It's important you ask, and inform them since worker comp and state taxes depend on where you live. And good news for you NV has no state taxes "
"Might depend on the job. Some companies only let their remote workers reside in certain areas. Others don't care. It usually has to do with the tax responsibility of the employer. With employees spread all over the world, payroll is one of the more painful aspects of a remote business. Some companies don't care to deal with all that and restrict their employees to only work in states where they already have a presence. Best thing to do is talk to your employer about the move and find out what their policy is."
"Taxes are always based on where you live. 

I've read that a lot of remote workers from CA are not being allowed to move out of state by their companies because they don't want to learn the rules of other states."
"A lot of remote jobs require high end skills and a proven track record in your field so employers have a reasonable idea that you're actually working when you're at home.

Entry level WFH jobs can be much trickier to find."
is this for real? It would be nice to see how actual workers feel about work from home. Can i share my thoughts anonymously? I'd rather not have my employer find out.
"Many employees also don't want to work from home all the time. If you've got kids or live in a cramped apartment, getting out of the house a few days a week is way more productive"
"A couple things make a big difference:

Noise cancelling wireless headphones 

Sit/stand desk 

A comfy office chair 

Two monitors 

A bedroom designated as a home office, that I can close off from the world"
"Dual monitors and ergonomic equipment like keyboards and a good chair are the most useful things in my home office. 

The things that make me happy but aren't technically useful, per se, are things like candles and a mini fridge stocked with my favorite LaCroix. "
"Good employers will supply you with proper ergonomic office equipment. My employer gave me a sit/stand motor powered desk with a dual monitor attachment, a floor mat, and office chair.

Granted, my job is highly technical, so I got really good monitors and stuff, but most companies, I feel, take advantage of dual monitor setups.

I would say the setup I have should be considered the standard of supplied equipment for most wfh employees. Other specialized equipment should be supplied depending on your job.

Can't really comment on software since most things are already supplied and this can vary widely depending on your job, but if you find something that will help, talk to your IT dept and manager about getting it and is it's eligible for reimbursement if you have to pay for it."
"Wow sounds like a great setup, I'm getting home office envy haha. 

Yes indeed! Would be great if employers could offer some reimbursement at least!"
"My work doesn't prove me any equipment and I'm basically free lance for one client.. 

My spouse's work does provide him with a laptop. We both WFH for two vastly different industries.

I'm in copy editing, and he's in web dev. Mine's basically data entry with SEO keywords, and web dev isn't really data entry, but he jokes that it might be."
"Yes, they are everywhere. The insurance industry went remote before covid to ensure they had enough claims processors. Customer service centers as well. But most remote jobs available now were not remote before covid. When coivd happened some businesses were leasing office space. They let that space go when their workforce went remote. Those who owned their space leased some of it out. They downsized their office footprint but kept the remote workers. Some businesses no longer have the office space to house all their employees & plan to continue using remote work because their making money on this. Some businesses recognize financial advantages to them of having remote workers. Not all jobs can be remote. But many can and are."
"ask for WFH, never mention another job.

your boss is not your friend.

this is what she's going to say:
""well we already give you x days at home, we feel that's enough because you should be apart of the culture here"" or some type of bullshit like that.

then start applying elsewhere

get hired,

then leave without notice."
"I did. I put in my two weeks notice and told my supervisor that I didn't see a point in going in office. 

I can do everything fully remote and my whole team is in a totally different state as well as my supervisor. I wouldn't ever see them or get to work with them. Everything would still be through Zoom. Plus we are all adjusters so we work individually anyway. I told him the commute which is between 45 mins to an hr would take away from work I could be doing.  Plus I didn't see a reason to go into an office not knowing anyone not able to collaborate with my team and being distracted by a full office. There weren't assigned seats it's first come first serve. At this point I would just be a seat filler for no reason. 

He agreed and spoke to his higher up and they allowed me to wfh."
"Actually in this situation it is in her hands. The manager before her denied remote work completely. Our organization at the top basically allows it but it's up to the individual managers how they want to implement it. But I can see this putting her in a bit of a tight place. It's almost like ""let me fully remote or be prepared to lose me"" sort of thing."
I will say AweSun Remote Desktop software is the best and trusted brand out there if you want to help your staff with their work while working from home or for any other kind of remote access. I have been using remote access well before the pandemic struck and work from home became the normal norm and ever since I have used a plethora of softwares. Be it TeamViewer or Anydesk I have had an experience of all and in a nutshell I will just say just go for AweSun.
"Work from home is the new trend and apart from so many platforms that deal with anxiety issues solutions or to put your staff's mental health at ease. I guess the biggest responsibility is how to control and manage everything from the desk at your home while you can't hold a meeting anymore or coexist with each other like anything but in real life. Here is when everybody runs for remote support. So now if you are looking for the best and reliable and fast Remote Desktop software that does not give you a headache there are plenty of options but I will help you choose among the popular ones. Most people recommend TeamViewer, Anydesk and AweSun. I will say go for AweSun Remote Desktop software. I have been using it for a month now and I experienced zero issues and it's just going really well."
"> you can't hold a meeting anymore

The 6 meetings I have on my calendar today disagree. I've been WFH for almost 3 years, the number of meetings I have increased when I went WFH."
"Not trying to be rude but I gathered the position was hybrid from your first paragraph. . . But anyway if this is any consolation, at CVS work from home they wait to get you to in person orientation to tell you that its WFH ""Opportunity"" which basically means after 6 week training on site they will decide if you can WFH. One of my co workers did a 3 hour commute everyday and after graduation was told he had to stay on site. Cant be reevaluated until 90 days. They also tried to discriminate against the pregnant women but got in trouble. Anyway, my point is, good thing you found out sooner than later!"
"I once accepted a job that was supposed to be WFH. After I start, I found out that technically I could work from home but I'd be at a huge disadvantage because management was old fashioned. So, I found out that everyone else was going to be going back into the office."
"Yup. I was already kind of hesitant to leave a job where I'm pretty established as a remote worker. This is the type of opportunity where I thought it might have been worth the risk, but obviously it was not!"
"I was a hiring manager once and HR told me it was fine for my staff to WFH as we worked on cloud based systems.

Fast forward 6 months, new CFO, and I get railed in a staff meeting because apparently it's against policy (we didn't have a policy) and I never got it cleared through HR. The HR manager denied the conversation. Lesson learned."
"Interesting question and topical for me too. I'm planning to ask about the possibility of going fully remote in NZ then at a later date moving to Canada. Not sure if the business would approve as I recall some policy stating remote work must be in the same tax jurisdiction. If this was an issue, perhaps you could transfer if they have a UK office - but still working remote."
"WFH full time, but single. "
"Thanks for your message! Yes, we will definitely explain the research methodology in the journal article we are writing about remote work during COVID-19."
"TL;DR - don't log in immediately upon waking; get up at the same time you did when you had to leave the house, use that time to shower & change, stretch & move. Prepare some food in case you get busy, and fill up your water bottle. Designate a stationary work area to set boundaries, listen to engaging background noise (podcasts, audiobooks, radio) and take your breaks!

~

In the beginning, I found it really difficult to adjust to working from home all of the time. I would literally just wake up at the last second, roll out of bed and log into work. Some days, I wouldn't even get out of bed, and I would just have the laptop with me. I started getting so lazy and drained, I'd forget to eat breakfast, not shower or change for at least half of the day - forget to breathe!

After a few months of this it started to take a toll on me and I felt quite exhausted. I realized that although I'm not a strict routine person, it was very important to incorporate a healthy and regular routine into this situation. Not only to feel fulfilled, but also to have some time to myself the way I had while getting ready for work in the morning and before leaving the house.

Personally, it took me a while to figure out the best strategy for myself. But I started to hop in the shower as soon as I woke up. I set up a designated space for my work. I was lucky to have this, but even if you're lacking space it's important to have some sort of a boundary. I also found that it increased my productivity, because I made this a stationary setup where I was no longer able to bring my laptop with me elsewhere (I could, but effort) as I had it hooked up to a keyboard, mouse, and dual monitors. This, for me, was the most important step in my process of creating a healthy work from home environment.

So, after my shower I would then turn my computer on and let the remote desktop load up while I made coffee, prepared some breakfast for later (as I don't usually eat straight away, but it would help me to not get so busy I'd forget to eat)  I would also fill up my water bottle because I also noticed i had a serious lack of water intake, especially compared to when I was in the office, because going for water stops with my colleagues was a way to get away, have a break from the desk, stretch & move.

I also thought it was helpful in the morning to get outside and go for a walk anywhere, for about 10 minutes, even if it was just to grab a coffee or pick something up from the store or pharmacy, check the mail - whatever. Because walking was a very normal part of my daily routine beforehand, getting about 8,000 steps a day on foot commute alone! Also, this lack of movement and exercise was starting to become apparent

Usually during the day now I like to put on podcasts, or some kind of background noise - talk radio, audiobooks, or music. Something that is easy listening, interesting at times, and keeps my brain engaged. While this may not work for everyone and could be distracting, I'm coming from a quite social and vibrant office and noticed that while at home I was spending more time on my phone throughout the working day than I would have at the office. Having something else to listen to or distract me from being at home, helped keep me accountable and focus on work.

Well, this turned is a novel LOL but I just wanted to share my complete experience! It can be hard, but keep trying it out and you'll figure out the best steps for you.

And most of all, remember to keep your head up!"
"The dedicated workspace is key for getting you into and out of the mindset. I have been wfh since last March temporarily , but I was just made a permanent remote position. So I have put some money into making my workspace better. I am still struggling with the decompress time at the end of the day though. With the family home, they want me engaged and there as soon as possible. I have a fairly stressful job so the hour drive I used to have was great for the separation."
"I practise a flexible approach when it comes to remote working:

- Flexible start and end time, depending on the workload for the day and whether there's meetings (or not)
- I may go out and exercise / do sports if I have finished my work for that day, or before I start work (doing this usually gives me lots of energy, which can help boost my work productivity by a lot for the rest of the day)
- Not necessary to 'dress up' when working, except during meetings
- Always use virtual backgrounds during meetings"
"I get up at 8:30. Get the dogs settled. I make coffees. I put on a movie in the home office and start my day. After my last meeting in the afternoon, I'm done and migrate back downstairs. Maybe a nap if I'm not wound up. I've been WFH for years. Same for my neighbor. Between my routine, I get most of my house projects done between calls. Mowing the lawn, cleaning, laundry, big projects, etc. It helps to put my focus on the home and working is simply secondary. Weekend rolls around, and I'm freed up."
"I've found that one of the biggest components for me, in spite of the smaller details of my routine, is having a dedicated workspace/home office. It allows me to say ok ""this is where I work"". I have made it comfortable and as perfect to my liking as I can get it since I spend almost 10 hours of my day here. It's in a part of the house I don't really otherwise need to go to so that evenings and weekends its out of sight, out of mind."
"I LOVE working from home. Honestly, I am going to be miserable when it is time to head back to the office.

My work from home routine has gone through several stages, from waking up a minute before clock in time, to laying in bed with laptop and tv on, to working from the moment I woke up (even hours earlier) and working until I was too exhausted to think anymore, logging way more hours than usual.

But, in the end, I have found my groove.

I have been lucky and never gotten behind in my work, and eventually felt bored and started challenging myself. 

Suddenly, I started feeling pride in my work, feeling more accountable, and responsible for the work I produced.

 Now more than I ever, my confidence level in the work I produce is higher than it has ever been. Much more so now than it has ever been with Management always micro managing and hovering all the time.

I am an introvert and only truly happy when I am home. 

I have an amazing relationship and pets I cherish so much. I use to waste so much time at work just checking into my wifi home cameras, watching my pets while stuck at my desk.

The distractions in the workplace also use to drive me crazy, I needed headphones to drown out the noise most of the time and the mindless chit chat has always been a struggle for me.

I always avoided lunch rooms, and chose to work through my lunch instead.

Now, I have the best routine. Wake early, spend time with my family and pets. Make myself breakfast or coffee which I never use to do. 
I make an effort to take my lunch breaks now, and eating (I never use to eat lunch) 

Now, when I work, I actually feel like I have done a good job and proud of what I get done daily.

Its a very different world. I love it. 
My pets and family love it.

I couldnt dream of a better work life balance.

I wish working from home will never end.
Sorry my post got so long!"

"The other reason (aside from denoting the physical location of wherever they have it) is that smaller businesses avoid recruiting from certain states that have complicated tax requirements, even if you are remote.  For example,  my company is WFH,  but I am encouraged/begged/asked to not recruit from Pennsylvania or NJ because of the complicated tax filings in those states (or they ask me to add payroll for another finance person if I recruit there).  I try to work with that, but it is tough when you find the perfect candidate in Philadelphia."
"How about recruiting? I have recently been in communication with recruiters who are working fully remote. Can at least start there? In my personal experience, the recruiting peeps I've interacted with (either solely through email or email and phone) have been sooo nice and more empathetic, I think is greatly in part bc they get to work from home. Best of luck! "

"Missed the deadline but I would do it if it was extended. Currently working from home full time, normally work from home 2 days per week."
I'm in a specialized field and more and more firms are offering permanent WFH flexibility.
"Since you mentioned this I tried to search myself because I like to keep an eye on what's out. I've searched for jobs in my area, they don't say remote. Though, when I google the reviews and articles on that company or their website, it mentions about hybrid/flexible remote or full remote work. I am hopeful now :)"
"I'm heavy on the introverted side, and I have ADHD, so remote work is my sweet spot. That said, I still need some kind of human interaction lol. No idea if any of this would satisfy you, but these are things I do:

* I have my office (spare/guest bedroom), and that is for work and computer stuff. Nothing else. I do not work in other areas of the house. I do have my personal computer in here on a separate desk, but again, even that is a bit separated from ""work.""
* I have my daily ""power list"" to keep me focused on things I need to work on that day that may or may not be directly related to my job. Might be for a certification, or just self development, but I'm not just ""working""
* I have several zoom/""wine zoom"" calls a month - one team I worked with we would do that every now and then (none of my current teams do); my sister and I do a monthly one (she's on the other side of the country); my mother and I have a bi-weekly one
* I make time for my hobbies that get me outdoors and around people who I can shoot the shit with and just hang out and have a good time
* Every day I make time for workouts, one of which is outdoors (frequently regardless of the weather - yes, even in crappy weather - get outside for 45 minutes - say hi to a neighbor or just be out in nature)
* When the day is done, the computers are shut down, and I go focus on the rest of my life.
* Once a month or so I have a lunch meeting with someone - a colleague, a business partner, an entrepreneur friend, or just a friend who's conversation I find stimulating and bettering. Sometimes these might happen a couple times a month - I could make them happen weekly (especially if I meet up with different people), and might move towards that at some point here.
* I'm taking part in a challenge (self managed challenge) that requires me to really plan and regime my days, but also makes me ""take care of me."" That challenge isn't for everyone, but some variations exist that some find a better fit (75/Live Hard is what I'm doing)

All that said, I am not someone who particularly needs or even wants the ""collaboration"" thing at work - I'm an INTJ who falls into a DiSC D very strongly, so my perspective is a bit different and the things you're really missing, I'm stoked to not have to deal with LOL. Regardless, teamwork is still important as is good leadership, so perhaps some virtual team building would help (no, it's not the same) or filling that need elsewhere if work is getting accomplished would at least mitigate your yearning for more interaction and make it more tolerable."
Good call out. I guess by rhythm I mean the cadence of the days that I used to have with my hybrid role where are each day would feel a little different because I was in different places. It sounds like you have a need for good music - which I can see how WFH would accommodate well :)
"Which is fair enough. So think the trick then is to place more weight on that benefit of WFH for you. May not be ideal work sitch, but it enables you to grow and manage your rental properties"
"Embrace wfh and your current role but always keep an eye out for something happening in your area. 

Just always keep looking for more but embrace where you are currently and be grateful every day. 

Not easy btw, I'm trying to do it more myself!"

. 100% remote, allowing a digital nomad lifestyle, and not confining me to one nation.  


This is very unlikely, most normal workfrom home jobs that are tied to specific companies don't allow travel like you might want. There are laws and tax implications that usually get in the way

  
. Moderately paid (if well-paid, even better, but not necessary)

This is possible but harder, most common wfh job is call center I think, and wouldn't even call that moderately paid. IT is a good one, that doesn't usually need a degree, but you do need to have specific knoweldge for that

  
. Not tied to set work hours, but to daily tasks or minimal daily goals

This is also very unlikely, as most jobs require some sort of schedule, even salary I need to be available certain hours.

  
. Not too hard to find, therefore high in demand/not saturated  
The pay usually gets in the way here, the more the pay it is, the higher the demand but also the more focused the search is

  
. Not requiring a university degree, but rather skills obtainable through online courses, bootcamps, or individual study  


Sales, marketing, IT, programming are ones I think that would fit here that offer a chance at getting paid well

  
. Not replaceable by artificial intelligence in the future.

Yeah thats a possiblilty for most work from home jobs.I do IT and the only thing saving me is there isn't robots to do actual hardware replacements that I have to do in person sometimes  
  
. As stress-free as possible

Stress free usually means a pay cut, I make probably 50-70% of what I would normally make in a commercial job that I do working for a college

&#x200B;

What your really looking for is freelance work, learn a skill you can market, or even doing videos about PT on youtube in your spear time and see if you can get some money that way. That way you working for yourself and generally can set any schedule you want."
"1. Highly recommend testing chairs in person if you can. I bought a $$$$ autonomous chair without testing it & ended up hating it. $100 office chair from Costco is way more comfortably.

2. I also don't have much natural light in my office area & use 2 of [these](https://a.co/d/a5aFES0) angled towards the wall/ceiling to light up the room. Makes it feel warm and cozy even in pitch black/night. 

3. I got some shallow desk containers to sort little things on my desk that I used often, cables, chapstick, etc. but stored most stuff in my office in one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FSJJQD5?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share)

Edit: welcome to remote working! I found having a good routine as if I worked in an office helped. Every morning I wake up, get ready for the day, make coffee, take my dog out - physically leaving the apt for a quick walk helps reset my mindset of working. I do the same in the evening and it helps reset my mental state for work/home every though I'm in the same place."
Could you be more specific? Are you helping businesses adopt wfh policies or working directly with wfh'ers? What specific supports are you hoping to provide? What would encompass being a beta tester?
"Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but after WFH for over two years, I've realized that many of the pros are also cons.

\- PRO: I can wear leggings every day now. CON: I wear leggings every day now.

\- PRO: I have a chance to eat healthier lunches that I've prepared myself. CON: Now I'm stuck making lunch for myself every day.

\- PRO: I don't have to have speak in person with people regularly. CON: I don't speak in person with people regularly. 

\- PRO: I get to spend more time with my dog. CON: My dog is sick of spending so much time with me.

\- PRO: I don't have to wear pants to meetings. CON: None.

All kidding aside, if I could only give one tip, it would be: don't always WFH by yourself. Some days it's fine, but other days you really need to surround yourself with people (whether it's friends online in a Slack channel or actual humans in the same room). My fiance and I both WFH together and it has made all the difference for me."
"Don't fall into complacency.  Many people who WFH will on board fast and then not keep themselves motivated.  If you want a shot at getting hired full time after your 6 month contract period, you are going to have to bust your ass for 6 months to show what you have.  As you said, the position you are taking on will go away and its all dependent on turnover.  Be ready to get out there and kick it in the ass."
"I got hired last month to WFH doing T1 help desk stuff. This is also my first job being full remote. One important question I've asked during my interview with HR and my manager is would the company be providing me the equipment to work with? (Laptop, docking station, monitor, etc.) I would start off there as every company has a different policy on security/privacy and I would assume most would provide their employees with equipment their IT department sets up beforehand for new employees. This also helps separate work life from private life and you'll learn quick to keep those apart. Another question is the scheduling. How flexible is my schedule? Do I work in shifts or am I able to make my own schedule as long as it meets the 40/hr week requirement? This sets a foundation of is this going to be a routine job or will I need to be disciplined to make sure I work my hours. Judging from context, it seems discipline is the least of your worries. Now...to answer your questions:

1. I've only had to keep my camera on during orientation and the first few meetings with my manager during training. Once you get the ball rolling, cameras become an optional thing as your team will just call you via zoom or teams without camera enabled. You're right about there being etiquette. I try not do eat or drink while my camera is on but depending on the length of the meeting, sometimes those things can't be helped and it'd be best to move yourself or your face off camera and take a quick bite/sip. I used to vape but I quit earlier this year. I would also recommend not doing this for at least the first few meetings with camera (if possible, try not to do it at all during meetings) otherwise, chain smoke away. Also, I've never had a meeting go past an hour so an 8 hour meeting seems overkill unless they want to monitor you and make sure you're working which is a big no-no in this sub.
2. Your job title sounds like you'll mostly be doing data entry and only answering phones when there's high call volume. I would say that you will definitely have time to do a quick check in on the misses and child. I'm sure you'll be able to do that multiple times a day including during your lunch break which would be great because now you have an extra hour each day in your life to spend with them compared to working in office.
3. I can only speak from my short experience of WFH since I'm still less than a month in but I do have to say...it'll be the best thing you'll experience in your life occupation wise. Ever since I started WFH, it's been a little weird at first because I'm used to waking up early, getting ready for commute, working in office, then commute back home when sun is almost gone. I then have to worry about cooking dinner and cleaning and by the time I'm done, it's bedtime and I rinse/repeat the cycle for 5 days a week. NOW, I have the freedom to wake up later, not have to worry about making lunch because I can make home lunch at home, take MULTIPLE breaks throughout the day, and work on house chores so that when my shift finishes, I have time to myself. I've definitely seen myself become less stressed and I'm grateful for having this opportunity to WFH. I can honestly say I will have a hard time finding another job after this because I've been spoiled from the time I started working...not just because of my personal benefits but the company I got hired to work for has been nothing but great and they've been taking care of me from day 1.

I can go on and on about this but this is basically my ted talk on how great working from home is and I'm sure many others can attest to the same thing. Hope this helps and good luck with your new job, OP!

edit: It's irrelevant but it's 1am for me and when I seen this post, I got out of bed because I wanted to share my experience with you since I was in a similar boat with not knowing what to expect. If possible, find a daily routine that works for you. I haven't found mine and it's starting to show in my mid-section."
"The truth is you really don't have the details (nor should you). There is an interactive process for ADA accommodations that hopefully the company is following and working with the person on. The process goes through steps and takes some time. It can lead to re-assignment to a new job (at the pay etc of that role), if/when the job opens up. This is typically not the first option though. 

The other thing that can occur is employees paint themselves into a corner with their documented disability. Basically they document they can not perform x duty. It turns out the x duty is required and not something that can be accommodated reasonably. 

Really weird twist... in one of the areas we operate if a person is WFH, the employer is the one responsible to assure their home meets the same criteria for workplace safety as any other office site. So if a WFH person said, I need an accommodation of no noise (at my home) the employer would be in a tough spot to assure their home met the requirements. Even with out the little twist, I suspect even the email job has some requirement for noise to occur."
"Their last WFH job provided more accommodations for their disabilities but also had lower requirements to meet. So while my job requires us to speak to 8-10 customers per hour, their previous company required 4-5 per hour. My job requires us to be available at least 85% of the time while their previous job required about 70%.

These specific requirements were not made clear during any part of the hiring process  for any of us, as those requirements/expectations still change as the company grows. 

Coworker has been asking to work on emails more often during the day, hasn't even asked to be moved 100% to emails. They would do better with more time after calls to recover, but our system is set up to only allow 2 minutes after calls before the next one comes in."
"Most of your anxiety will go away once you start. Did the company you're working for provide you with the equipment to work from home ? I have been working office jobs since I was 22yrs old and I'm in my late 30's and one thing I have learned is anxiety regarding your job is useless. If you got the job, it was meant to be and to be honest if you believe in GOD your life is already planned so there's not much you can do about it. I wouldn't worry about the job until after you start. Take it one day at a time and I guarantee you will be successful and if it's a good company you will find out during the first week. Make your own opinions and take the rest with a grain of salt. Keep in mind that former employees are not going to speak well of the company no matter what. Only the people that got fired or were wronged will spend the time to voice their opinion not the ones that have been there for years. 

I've been at my company for about 2yrs and I started work from home work from home with this company over a year ago. They supplied me with all the tech to do my job and I have never been late and I used to only be paid a salary when I first started to now being a sales leader at my company making the same salary but also commission of an average of $5k per month. Not a whole lot but it's a lot to me because my salary is $35k. This year I've doubled my pay from last year. I did not come to this company thinking that I would grow. It was just a job at the time but I made it into a career. Don't worry too much until you start and after you start keep looking for other remote jobs as backup for when you want to leave. I would try and get into insurance sales like me. It's always needed and a computer can't do the job. You will always have security in sales if you're good at it."
You've already done enough and worrying now before the job starts is only going to cause you more anxiety. A customer service role work from home is not a bad one. If the pay is good then it's all good. Contracts can always be extended and how bad could a customer service job be when you work from home? It can't be that bad and I'm sure you'll get proper training and the trainer should be a good person to find out about whether the company is a good or bad company. Now stop worrying. Good luck!
"I've been working from home for over 5 years. I just started a new job, also WFH, in January. If I'd taken this survey in December, my answers would have been vastly different."

"Yup.... And i gave them an ultimatum. 

Option 1 I stay WFH full time with zero changes as per my contract. (They refused) 

Option 2 We renegotiate my salary to accommodate RTO as now I have expenses I did not have when I initially accepted the salary they offered as that salary was contingent on a full time WFH position. (The 14k i took as a paycut for this position since it was WFH....They refused) 

Option 3 I leave. I pointed out they're on a hiring freeze; we're already down 4 staff members; and I do the work of 3 people. As well im HIGHLY desirable and ill have an offer by end of the week. (""If that's how you feel...."") They didn't believe me; I put in my notice in 3 days for an EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY notice and the note ""You have 24hrs to counter my current new offer, you know my terms. ""

I'm zoomed out. Nothing irritates me more being in an office to just sit on zoom/teams/WebEx. WFH isn't new and this was the norm before COVID. We sat in conference room and conference remote people. There is a way to make them feel inclusive. Make sure your Conf rooms have smart AV. Owl is pretty good and inexpensive:)
"Yeah my company let us do 1 day a week remote pre-COVID and we'd miss so much in meetings when working remote. Needs proper buy in from management too, our senior leadership got annoyed when we all synced our WFH day since our team had no physical presence those days. So we either have some lacklustre meetings or sacrifice our WFH day all together, obviously everyone chose the former."
"The smart way to do hybrid isn't by mixing remote and non-remote workers from the same department, on the same teams.  It's letting departments, like support workers, who don't need to be in an office just to sit on a computer all day, work from home. 

It should also be  an option for anyone who needs it and has a position that can be done from any computer, like pregnant or new mothers and fathers, it could be an option to work from home instead of using sick days, or coming to work sick infecting the office, or other flexible ways. 

If you're concerned about missing side conversations, then you need to go into the office. You can't have it both ways. Especially if you asked to be remote."
" I don't really think that hybrid work is completely around remote meetings though. So that shouldn't be the deciding factor of whether or not to be hybrid, onsite, fully remote, etc. Is it more convenient to do one over the other? Probably. But more convenient for the company's ops. There's a lot more that goes into the decision. Hybrid means that there's a lot more flexibility for remote workers. 

I'm completely remote because that's what's been working best for my lifestyle. However, there are colleagues, especially through the pandemic, who struggle with WFH because they have small spaces (i.e. live in the downtown core) and so WFH just isn't feasible. Plus, other people might prefer the office environment. So, ultimately offering more flexibility means that you're able to have a larger talent pool.

It's not perfect by any means, but there are ways to make it better for everyone (hence the article!)"
"Well, not almost everything. Some things.  Jobs done 100% on computers can mostly be done from home. That's not the reality of most people in most industries.

Also, everyone who wants to work from home, isn't ready to work from home. Meaning they don't invest in their tools, or infrastructure so that when they're needed to collaborate or conference they're putting out a great presentation.

They got the company laptop and that's it. Everyone else looks like crap, so it must be OK to look and sound like crap from home. 

I've been in enough collab meetings or Zoom calls where I'm wondering how people are still having latency issues, or look like they're using a potato as a webcam, or are still struggling with bad sound and lighting. A year later.  It's a terrible experience for everyone. I can understand why some bosses would be tired of struggling with that."
"You're pretty focused on your own experience and not considering other industries and experiences. Most jobs CANNOT be done remote. It's only IT and knowledge workers who can do this. Most people have to physically be at their jobs.

>Personally, it's the employer's responsibility to provide employees withadequate tools. If any boss is frustrated with bad call quality, well,they should rectify that themselves.

If it's a remote job from the start, yes, and they usually do.

If it's not originally meant to be WFH and employers are accommodating you...I  believe that you should invest in your tools. For me the whole point of WFH is being able to use my own tools, not just the basic crap that the company gives everyone. That's just me.

I think it's short-sighted to want it both ways. WFH means you're responsible for your work environment now. This is something people are asking for. I don't think it's too much to ask that they keep up the professionalism, or as a boss, it's not worth it. Come back to the office.

WFH should not mean a sacrifice in the quality of your communication, presentation,  and professionalism.

If I'm making decisions on who will be allowed to continue WFH and who needs to come back to the office, the people who haven't upped their home game, who it is a struggle to communicate with, and don't know how to use their remote tools well... I'm making them come back to the office."
">I even said that WFH isn't an option in some sectors by their very nature (a train driver cannot WFH), but in the rest 99% of the roles can be done from home.

That's just not true, I don't care how many times you repeat it. 99% of all jobs cannot be done remotely. 

>I wouldn't even consider a role where the company doesn't provide equipment or won't reimburse my own purchases.

Understandable, and most do. But no company will ever issue equipment that's better than my own. I wouldn't my own computer for their work, but for most other peripherals and infrastructure I'd rather use my own stuff.  It's a personal choice, not a debate."
"We were doing happy hours like once or twice a month via Zoom. But they were awkward and filled with painful silence sometimes. Our office culture was so fun before COVID. We had monthly events, team outings, and went to lunch together often. We're trying to plan a social distance pizza/cake thing this weekend to make up for all the birthdays we've missed, but I don't know if that's going to actually happen. We're a small office, less than 10 people.

During my time WFH, I realized I enjoyed the social aspect of my job more than my job haha."
"Our wonderful office manager sent out personalized care packages to everyone based on a Google survey, even hand delivered a few. We have Friday check-ins via Zoom. From the leadership of my team similar check-ins and incentives. We we're gonna move offices this month but now we will be WFH till 2021 at the earliest. Moral gets lowest when someone on my team isn't carrying the load thankfully for the most part my company has tried to keep us happy"
"I joined Google 2 months ago and my experience matches yours exactly.

Likewise, I have been a lead at a startup before this and was able to ramp up all my reports during WFH using similar techniques to what you describe. It was social, fun, and everyone was productive within weeks. I want to get that going here, but it seems like nobody cares.

Feeling incredibly isolated and demotivates by this. Considering how good of a team dynamic I have had in my previous jobs, I'm seriously considering jumping ship as soon as I have enough tenure that doesn't look suspect on my resume.

It's been 2 months since you posted this. I'm really curious, has anything improved at all for you? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?"
"Just here to say that I hope it's gotten better for you but also thank you for this post. I'm in HR and currently building out HR processes at a tech company that previously didn't have HR. I'm working on onboarding currently and we're WFH. Although I don't like that your onboarding was what it was, this post was valuable to me in writing the best onboarding plan I can for my future and current team, so thank you."
"this should be published lol. it's so reflective and well written.

it's a very very different challenge and many companies need to upgrade onboardin procedure. 

i too am experienced engineer who recently joined an established company wfh. it's incredibly hard. wfh is by itself can be distracting for me, but in a new environment it's really something else. i get lost a lot."
I completely agree but a WFH for 18 if you live in a low cost   rural area might be an awesome thing. Part of my motivation here is that I  love Ifixit. Lol  I think this job would be fun.
